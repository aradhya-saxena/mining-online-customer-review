battery: Cons:- The battery life terrible

phone:  My old V180 would last whole week standby, cheapest phone could buy; 6126 lasts 2-3 days

battery:  I fear bad it's going battery starts wear out

phone:  Sure phone play MP3s, really going carry around set Nokia-specific headphones that? This part really annoys me, MP3 player portion useless IMO one major reasons I picked phone

camera: - Camera quality poor

phone:  Apparently generally true cell phones

phone: Overall, I'm ambivalent phone

battery:  I like design features, battery life proprietary connections really annoy me

battery:  I already expecting below-average battery life sub par camera, benefits I expecting outweighed concerns me

phone:  The problem release button sometimes accidentally pushing pull phone receiving call

phone:  If phone set automatically answer opens, release gets pushed accidentally, it's call don't want take moment, you're stuck holding phone closed stops ringing

phone: Moving phone's problems: One might assume combination Bluetooth stereo MP3 playback phone would imply A2DP (stereo) Bluetooth profile supported

phone:  Admittedly, I probably assumed specific mention A2DP implied phone support it, doesn't help searching internet yields mixed results issue, even Nokia tech support still can't tell one way other

phone:  First, music controls cumbersome, using cursor system activate on-screen buttons rather using phone's keypad controls

phone: The phone apparently tested "large" music libraries

phone:  However, music transfer application included Nokia PC Suite develops problems trying read library anything 2000 songs so

phone:  Nokia tech support informed test libraries around 1000 files under

phone:  The phone organize tracks subfolders; tracks within main music folder subfolders loaded one huge playlist

phone:  And gets worse: filling 2GB card manually creating playlist every album, 77 total, attempting change playlists completely crashes phone

phone:  It's almost humorous happens track 999: phone increments first 9 10, see track 10 000 (except last digit partially cut off)

phone:  I especially felt like beta tester Nokia tech support carry experiments large music library report back

phone:  Frankly, don't seem interested working kinks mid-market phone outdated software components

phone: I'd still recommend phone don't large music collection want use music player occasionally

price:  I did'nt even bother return ( I have), I figured nearly got money's worth

phone: I finally found ear piece 2 year old Nokia phone

phone: I finally found ear piece 2 year old Nokia phone

phone: Excellent product - I've ordered three case one stops working

phone:  It's truly hands free answer calls hang without find cell phone it's attached to

phone:  It's truly hands free answer calls hang without find cell phone it's attached to

price:  Don't know it's worth 24

price:  That sounds bit expensive, type quality it's well worth it

phone:  The on/off button hard press, press hard hang use voice dialing

phone:  The Nokia brand earbud beats Jabra hands down

phone: It's necessary product driving especially easy use hang-up boutton mic

phone: It must saved couple times driving trying talk phone answer call

phone: Also, law it's illegal drive talking phone saves dumb tickets

phone: After I lost Nokia Earbud Headset Nokia 8890, I purchased Jabra EarBoom tried days returning it

phone:  The Nokia Earbud Headset lot better

phone:  I use phone day long, tried many brands styles ear pieces

phone: This headset works great Nokia 2610

phone:  The price great I got one husband's phone too

price:  The price great I got one husband's phone too

phone:  Other Nokia phones, 8290, 8260, etc

phone:  However, purchase product Nokia's website 14

price: 99(US$) so, I'm sure price marked high here

phone: I'd like add case &quot;perfect&quot; fit Nokia 8260

phone:  It's matter phone fitting another phone's case, 8260's charging port lines exactly hole case

phone:  The product fan-tastic

phone:  Retreival phone easy (you take phone case use, unless using headset)

phone:  (I use Nokia earbud now, ordered Jabra boom amazon)

price:  I would easily order again, would easily pay it

phone: This phone case great protecting phone 

phone:  Personally I found leather flap covers face phone annoyance

phone: It makes difficult to:1) Answer ringing phone - open properly locate call answer button2) Talk phone - You open dial either hold flap open talk (it rubs face) close open ensure properly hung up

phone: Unlike brands face flap opens horizontally, either rub neck trying talk phone open block peripheral vision slightly

phone: For reasons I prefer either cell phone case clear front front cover opens vertically removed entirely

phone: For reasons I prefer either cell phone case clear front front cover opens vertically removed entirely

screen: For reasons I prefer either cell phone case clear front front cover opens vertically removed entirely

phone: Lastly, I found make case I received hole bottom allows access charging jack headphone socket obstructed, requiring insert either angle, possibly damaging phone

camera:  I've even clipped camera case belt &amp; never lost despite roller coasters turn upside down

phone:  I personally use phone &quot;emergency situations&quot; I don't get many phone calls

screen:  As slip tight cover zip up, pulls fabric tape

phone:  When I contacted Nokia product, would nothing - covered poor workmanship

phone: I thought phone case good idea

phone:  But phone emergencies

price:  I don't think it's worth even [price]

phone:  At first kind tight getting fit phone I able fit phone

phone:  It also works good shock absorber drop phone

phone: I bought case time I purchased phone simply purpose protecting phone

phone:  After phone 2 months phone still looks brand-new scratches display all

phone:  Anyway aside compliments, exceeded expectations keeping phone mint condition

phone:  I lost phone riding motorcycle, never find it

phone:  I plan buying another Nokia phone look case can't slip easily sure I take I ride

phone:  Also, wasn't much hassle press buttons either

phone:  I used replace window Nokia 5165 every 2 months, I haven't replaced since purchasing case

phone: I bought case expectation clipping belt bag, making phone accessable

screen: The velcro-secured cover also gets caught hair gets way I hurry

phone:  It doesn't prevent accidentally pushing buttons phone, may fault

phone: I ordered case fit 6160 Nokia phone

phone: I ordered case fit 6160 Nokia phone

phone:  Since Nokia product, I expected quality got that; stitching straight, case fits like glove

phone:  As matter fact, case actually snug (probably allow leather stretch [over time] still properly fit phone), I found bit struggle unzip zip phone

phone:  It's leather-covered, doesn't protrude much beyond case, securely fastens phone belt

phone:  If don't need wrist strap, good case protect cell phone investment

phone:  5 stars Nokia making unique, well built headset

wifi: I several different wireless Bluetooth headsets now

phone:  The Nokia HS-11W unfortunately fails several criteria, almost every headset market right now

phone:  (The Nokia fails miserably; tines dug ear top bottom, impossible correct it

phone:  (The Nokia fairly well this, two tines hold ear may creep time ears, needing occasional help right hand stay place

phone:  (The Nokia middle pack this; times fairly good, sometimes wretched, certainly never excellent

wifi:  The best Bluetooth headsets available offer DSP (digital signal processing) filters noise, implementation technology inconsistent, DSP necessarily mean happy performance noisy conditions

phone:  (The Nokia cancellation circuitry, became obvious trying use bars even outside mildly windy conditions

phone:  (Like today's headsets, Nokia speaker rests ear, fails criteria anyhow, I also found volume low even quiet conditions

phone:  Fast connection speed solid connection - phone rings, need headset react quickly

phone:  Also, want connection phone stable

phone:  Many headsets drop frequently must reestablish connection even re-mated phone

phone:  (The Nokia well category, it's one criteria I could score highly in
