This must anyone spends lot time vehicle
 I used plug ear accessories work well short conversations short period time
 However, nothing compares this
 You place phone cradle thats it, rest
 While phone cradle, ignition on, charged
 The phone also set answer call comes even mute radio
 I give excellent rating
 

This device works great
 The speaker hidden dash still sounds perfect
 The microphone feedback picks anyone's voice anywhere car
 The external antanne (supported included) great typical cell phone reception area weak
 I also like small personal handset private conversations
 I installation would recommend hiring done unless done something like (tapping fuse box, mounting hardware car, pulling wires dash)
 A reasonable installation charge would $50 $100(it's easy)
 I purchase additional "post" mount cradle I could find suitable place use mount provided kit
 This great unit looks professional installed
 Only problem using mine, everyone else family wants one
 

This one product you'll wonder survived without it
 It well integrated phone
 Has antenna jack cradle external antenna (really needed area), automatic charger put phone cradle, volume control phone talking adjustable buttons phone, control car stereo turn phone use, handset private conversations
Note: 1) unless technical, I would get professional install -- f want phone control stereo, you'll probably pay extra extra contact relay required car stereo receivers
 3) For cars (Chevy Tahoe Chevy Silvarado Pickup) I buy extra bracket attach cradle dash without drilling holes dash -- attaches behind one seams dash
 That costs ~20 worth don't screw holes dash
 4) To control car sterio, receivers need contact relay (12V 30A, SPDT) shut receiver on
 I wish Nokia would supply part 


 hard find (Radio Shack doesn't sell particular part)
I would definitely recommend hands-free unit
 The thing bad Nokia 5165 phone basically free hands-free unit cost alot 


 

Very good product
 Would suggest anyone
 Buy soon


 

I bought installed Nokia car kit (CARK-91) Nokia phone
 Now, real pleasure quite safe talk drive
 I often hold conference calls car way office
 When travelling family, often call grandparents one place everyone join call once
 And car kit almost invisible cradle hidden behind dashboard panels
 The cradle strong sturdy, and, phone attached, look place next steering wheel
 Combined Nokia's quick dial features, car kit makes using phone car relatively safe
 

I use phone holder every day commute, conjunction auto charger hands-free earset
 I find indispensable securely fastening phone place, yet easily removable
 It makes one-hand dialing easy, I don't worry phone sliding around sudden turns stops
 One word note: doesn't accept use oversize extended-life batteries
 

Once Nokia end user mind designed simple, useful durable product mobile phone holder
 I used year I sold car phone holder installed it
 I hope new owner using Nokia phone, I miss it
 I purchased complete car kit install new car weekend, meantime I fumbling phone car, (of course I'm using headset), I realize great holder was
 (


) There nothing think except: going install it? Consistent sharp design great support products, low priced, functional mobile phone holder another winner Nokia
 

Nokia data cables great
 THey work well last long
 You even download ringtones phone
 

Like cell phone users, I two chargers phone: The supplied wall-wart charging transformer, accessory mobile charging cord
 The wall wart rarely got used- I'd find it, unroll cord, reach plug wall, etc
 Not handy device
 The mobile charger much convenient- I remembered use it, car I driving
 Oops, left charger van
 Oops, forgot connect it
 More I arrived office nearly dead phone
I bought little stand whim, really, it's turned single useful accessory I ever purchased cell phone
 Now, I come home, I immediately drop phone charging stand desk
 When I leave house, I grab phone it's always fully charged
 I haven't used mobile charging cord since buying stand
 I haven't to
 
































































































































































































































































NICE CASE
 GOOD QUALITY
 PHONE FIT A BIT SNUG TO START BUT LOOSENING UPAND FITTING BETTER WITH TIME
 

This first Bluetooth earphones I warned sound good
 However, BH-600 use DSP (digital signal processing) sounds good
 People told could hear much better I could hear clearly
 Jack Shasha 

I've used bluetooth headset never cared return poor fit
 The Nokia BH-600 worked well me
 It fits well, looks compact stays place
 The battery life could've better (it gives 3 hours talk-time ~ 72 hours standby time) - techie friend tells battery compromised compactness
 

This first bluetooth headset I purchased, I made sure I researched I bought it
 All signs pointed great product
 I went opposed another manufacturer I wanted stick Nokia brand
 The pairing Nokia N75 problematic first, I didn't correctly
 Read directions it
 The build quality exceptional
 It doesn't creak like new BH-602 grab it
 This headset along N75 bluetooth 2
0 things sounded great talking people, range good
 Walking 20 feet away wall phone I, little static, I expect bluetooth
 Sound quality good calls
 People sounded clear
 However, volume wise, could louder
 That's thing I saw downside, I gave 4/5 stars
 All buttons easy press locate, worries there
 Battery life amazing considering battery size
 I get 7 days usage single charge 3 hours calls multiple disconnections connections phone
 I let sit 11 straight days, still charge, I VERY impressed
 The specs say 9
17 days standby time
 This beep battery starting get low also
 The weight may issue looking wear 2 hours, maybe it's me
 It's heavyweight, feel it
 It's shame product simply didn't fit ear
 The time ever I beanie smashed ear
 You bend earloop liking secure ear, small ear opening, probably won't good fit
 If in-ear design like lot others, would excellent me
 But someone else, might great solution
 Great headset
 

I bought one Radioshack
 I could pair Bluetooth Nokia 6682 phone, connection established once
 After connection established
 Nokia customer support informed Bluetooth compatible Nokia 6682
 Tried phones, connection
 I going return this
 



















NICE CASE
 GOOD QUALITY
 PHONE FIT A BIT SNUG TO START BUT LOOSENING UPAND FITTING BETTER WITH TIME
 



























































First beautiful phone beautiful size beautiful feature-set targeted busy biz type
 Features tri-band reception, Dictaphone voice memos, Speakerphone hands free, PDA features for; contacts w/address, calendar todo event alarms day/wk/mo/yr repeatability recurring events like weekly meetings, birthdays, take trash :), etc
ALL features work great
 Plenty loud receiver, ringers, vibrator, speakerphone, adjustable
 Has separate power switch top quick access ringer options(one press) power-off(press hold)for batt save, etc
It small wear watch pocket jeans, shirt pocket, pants pocket without bulge
 Still, keypad layout I find easy dial keys cover total keyboard, unlike previous SE T234 small point buttons
 For derated phone small size, I don't get it? If want bigger phone bigger keys bigger screen, get one heaven sake
 Please rate phone features performance, size
 That positive want this
Those looking well featured small phone Nokia's quality RF reception, disappointed one
 You get camera, radio, mp3 player, tv size screen, memory enough gobs games, ringtones, wallpaper, screensavers video(this Nokia 6230i)
 You get excellent practical communication organizational device enough memory adequate games/ audio/video accessories features required practical user, good price
Pros: Power/Ringer quick access button, loud adjustable receiver, powerful vibrator flashing keyboard silent modes, small VERY stylish, dictaphone, speakerphone, user definable Shortcut/Goto list, Org Calendar/Calc/Stopwatch/Countdown/Alarm, Nokia RF reception, PC sync Nokia's free down-loadable SW
 Standard barrel-type charger plug
Cons: Non-standard headphone jack, side button volume control, non-customizable navigation keys
 

I've always owned Nokia phone simply works me(and I'm creature habit)
 =) If could care less owning tricked out, camera flip-phone bells whistles, phone you
 The one thing really differs phone (compared three Nokias I've years) buttons really small literally pain sometimes you're sending text messages
 After owning phone nearly month now, here's I've summarized:Pro's:* It's inexpensive* Nice, color display screen* Has useful voice recorder* Speakerphone useful (esp
 you're driving don't headset)* You change right, navigation button create faster shortcuts* Somewhat user-friendly cell phone challenged* Comes sleek travel size charger* If you're Cingular customer, got better reviews compared fancy-shmancy (and expensive) Samsung, LG Ericcson phones also offer
Con's:* Teeny, tiny key pad* Ring volume big difference levels 2 3* If headset older Nokia phones (such 3595), won't work one
 You'll splurge buy new headset
 =(* Ring tones kind weak, I'm 30 feels like teens mind creating ringtones phone (same thing wallpaper options)
* Games cool, bowling game limited +/- 5 games you're denied access
Hope useful anyone interesed buying phone
 =) 

I recently subscribed two year Cingular service
 At first I purchased Motorola V551, gave poor reception compared Samsung E315, I previously owned
 Not wanting expensive phone would drop calls frequently, I decided trade Nokia, becasue father used Nokia ever since started use cellular services, extremely satisfied
 The Nokia 3120 appealed it's styling
 Although technologically advanced phones I used to, styling appealied me, along fact phone 39
99
 I truly like styling
 It best I've seen bar phone class
 It outlandish essence
 It smart phone people want basic functionality
 What also appeals user interface
 It best one I've seen phone
 It smae interface used digital nokias, date back 1996, I first exposed Nokias
 It extremely simple use, convinient features accessed two three button pushes
 The biggest thing got purchase phone it's reception
 Better phone i've used
 I use deep inside buildings
 My mother Nokia 6010, call breakroom office, center building
 All packed sleek, understated enclosure makes phone pleaseing
My complaints phone lack "fun" features, camera video playback
 If really want camera phone, like hear abou Nokia, 6230 you, I buy 6-12 months
 Another thing I like color
 You get covers it, middle part phone, circuitry antenna lie, pasty white, guy like me, girly
 One friends commented exactly
 One flaw, though bother me, size phone
 While higly portable compact, buttons could small some
A summary pros cons (some list above)ProsStyling portabilityUser interfaceReceptionBright DisplaySpeaker phoneNokia dependabilityConsColor choicesize keypadlack "fun" features camera, although camera attackmentI know review long, I wanted cover aspects phone appear bisaed direction
 I like expensive phones, doesn't mean I can't make logical critique phone

A couple months ago, I Nokia 3120;however, I wanted try something new
 So I purchased Motorola v551
 At first I happy I so, later I regreted it
 So, I went back lovely Nokia 3120, compares highly quality fondness Motorola
 I absolutely love Nokia 3120
 It great reception, great image quality, great battery power, great design
 I Cingular I live CA, CA renowned it's bad reception I still get wonderful reception
 It also low price
I highly recommend phone
 

I've mine year now, I thought I'd offer comments
First, buy case
 This particularly tough phone
 My teenage son killed within six months
 Then again, always tossing around dropping it
 I've dropped mine too, case kept looking good
This small phone
 If you've got big fingers I do, may give difficulty
 I wouldn't buy smaller phone, one fits nicely anywhere
The display quite bright get settings right
 Perversely, display best wallpaper brightness "down
" When turn up, washes text out
The alarm clock fine, aftermarket accessories available interfacing PC work well enough little fiddling
 I've loaded MIDI files ringtones
 Not load correctly, you'll experiment that
The speakerphone isn't particularly powerful user end, person you're talking seems hear well enough
All all, decent - outstanding - phone
 I've looked others but, now, stayed little Nokia
 

recently got phone first impression was


WoW

this small phone

it basic features need cellphone
 text messaging, voicemail, alarm clock


if your'e minimalist starter, looking basic phone, recommend one you
 So far, pleased phone never drops calls, signal always full strength
 It good battery life, lasts days, interface intuitive Nokia's known making cellphones simple, great price
 Also, phone came day estimated arrival date
 If your'e looking good site buy good phone, your'e right place(Amazon)
 ;) 

I longtime Nokia supporter, love sell simple, easy-to-navigate phones pick great reception
 However, I returned phone one day use because:- sound quality good: static present background calls
- I put phone near speaker, phone caused speakers make disruptive bleeping noises
 This included car stereo speakerphone work
 

I'm going bore many features particular phone since user's guide online Nokia
 My complaint small numbers (4,6,7,9) are
 To dial number one actually use hands since using one hand lead mistakenly dial intended number
 I don't large hands found problem cumbersome overcome one hand
 One user also complained screen going blank recharging
 I agree him
 This happens phone user left wondering whether phone charging completely charged
 I don't know phone blanks charging
-AC 

first cell phone loved it
 owned two years
 it's perfect newcomer


cute style mixed easy use features
 

At first glance I fell love phone - small design, chrome plated front, friends love it, thinking another high-priced, fancy phone nokia/cingular, surprisingly affordable, I must admit - IS fancy, yet extremely "phone newbie" friendly
It everything want need plus more
 It text messaging, multimedia messaging, polyphonic ringtones, MEDIA NET, download many ringtones, games, applications, ANYTHING else may want need nokia 3120, found media net
 It's internet phone, letting download practically anything may want, including java apps
 If youre work, movies, dont feel like calling anyone, go ahead use instant message feature, logging onto AIM YAHOO chat buddies
 There many features phone - like screensaver could want, even record voice music use ringtone
Popular? 300 contacts/Calendar 500 entries
Cant get morning? Alarm clock
Timing something? Stopwatch/countdown
Bilingual? English, French, Spanish, Portuguese languages supported
You talk 6 hours like phone, go ahead leave desk 16 DAYS, yes DAYS, still able talk
 Total standby time 17 days
The call quality great, except put phone close stereo speakers, makes speakers beep, downside, totally negligable
I'd give phone 4/5 stars, features phone that's 4
01 inches long x 1
68 inches wide x 0
76 inch thick, weighs 3 ounces
 

This cell phone people want updated phone mobile technology, course talk call people
 The features great, sleek cell phone fit almost everywhere
 Color screen voice recorder, you'll find something you'll like
 

This decent phone ive year first phone 16
 Its somewhat stylish guess ive seen couple people good basic call phone texting
 features include internet expensive kinda worthless
 The thing complain 9 onths computer school work placed near speaker friend called made reall loud staticy noise (my speakers pretty loud could contributed it)it actually starteling made jump turn computer
 weak later put tv entering room layed another friend called loud still pretty annoying
 Anyway like world end might get startled awhile
 

Why settle less, commit specific cellular provider service plan, get complimentary unlocked top line Motorola RAZR v3i cell phone works cellular service provider SIM card
 I got mine free web site: ilikethis
info/razrv3i 

I bought phone 2 weeks ago, I wanted simple phone light, tri-band, decent battery (up 2 weeks standby time nowadays quite reasonable)
The battery standby didn't last 3 days, turn phone recharge battery, screen becomes totally dark: impossible know whether phone recharging, whether became fully charged, I've never seen Nokia phones
If characterstics generic, get rid A
S
A
P




 

I've phone since October
 I got small adorable
 At first I happy it


but I actually started using it, changed
 Good news first

PROS:-Loud volume-Easy use-Lots included ringtones

some cute, little there-Voice recorderCONS:-CONSTANTLY drops calls-Recieves text messages HOURS people send them-VERY small text messages--160 characters


most phones 800-The buttons make loud clicking noise sometimes shut phone minutes-Bad battery life

if send messages day talk phone minutes, you're gonna charge night-You can't real music tones-Voice recorder can't ringtone-Very bad speaker interference

I keep feet away computer/tv anything else speakersI wish people would said bad things phone I bought it
 Stay away phone possible

 

My review Cingular
 I bought phone w/service told I could return full refund charged air time used
 THEY LIE
 THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY
 THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though never worked area
 If uncertain keep phone service, DON'T BUY Cingular
 Amazon also nothing reimburse
 


I got new apple 3g 

 That biggest disappointment
 So Returned got phone
 This pretty cheap almost free
 This phone doesn't hi-tech functionality like you-tube, bluetooth etc
 Internet browsing didn't try cares


 keep mind phone basic purpose
Signal quality excellent
 I get bars even every one 'no signals', light weight good battery life
 What else expecting 'phone'drawbacks : bluetooth getting handsfree wire device also getting rare marketing techniques
 Also I miss volume control buttons side
but overall I happy dropped plans buy phone 

I needed basic phone - MP3, camera, FM radio
 This phone delivered great reception, good sound quality, great battery life, small size
 Inside building works great
 Why low score? The tinted plastic display makes impossible see display outdoors car
 If sun out, forget it
 I even managed figure remove wallpaper backgrounds maximize contrast
 Still, don't plan use outdoors
 Nokia recall product replace tinted cover
 Update: Yesterday phone took accidently dropped onto hard ceramic tile floor still works perfectly
 A similar drop ended life digital camera months ago
 So, I rate cell phone I would give 3 stars, maybe even 4 stars
 I like reliable, sturdy stuff cell seems unusually well made
 

I looking durable phone could take blow pressure keep working
 I also want random pieces falling struck
 I'm fairly small individual I also needed phone small enough fit pocket comfortably protrusions gouge me
 I need camera extraneous features like that
 This phone seems fitting criteria perfectly
 I planning spending quite bit phone meet criteria, I pleasantly surprised find phone free plan
I dropped couple times 10-12 feet onto concrete keeps working fine
 It slid 20 feet across piece concrete
 It minor scuffs nothing significant
 It buttons sides nothing fallen hit concrete
 It submersed water tank seems come back well also
As far visibility display issues people mentioned reviews, I noticed seems "power save" type situation kicks display difficult read
 Hitting certain keys seems kick "mode" off
 Other situations I difficulty reading display candy bar style phones I Nokia
 I used direct sunlight various lighting situations
 

Here's I rate cellphone:1
 Voice quality reception: +12
 Battery life: +13
 Fast opening browsing menu sub-menus: 04
 Build keypad spacing: +15
 No useless accessories: +1Bottomline: 4/5
The reviewers right screen sunlight: sucks
 But you're like chained cube daylight hours, doesen't matter much
The thing I dislike handset, quite slow opening submenus
 I would thought basic, stripped phone would lightning fast; indeed, one reasons I bought it, so
 Gone days could unlock phone call contact within second
Besides con, solidly built, exceptional voice quality, easy dial thick fingers
 

NOT even 'entry level' phone would useful basic functions
 Entry level screen see light reliable ringer
 Display brightness adjust contrast useful making screen harder see improve
 Using wallpaper white makes screen impossible see/read text even indoors dark room
 Fonts setting enlarge (Nokia knew screen junk) text small display prevents this
 Calls barely audible sound quality understand conversation (not due signal)
 Buttons small hands larger medium-sized fingers don't always make contact first time
 Screen back-light doesn't always light first button pressed
 When backlight screensaver time display impossible read activated
 Battery time good likely due screen dimly lit
 User settings place unintuitive fashion making personal settings time consuming chore instead one menu
I w/o camera, web, mp3, radio etc
 fail basic functions cell phone pretty bad & acceptable
 No wonder PAY $150
00 take phone
NO STARS 

I see highly rated don't understand be, unless screen visibility concern reviewers
 Look buy one
I'd never recommend 2610 single issue display unusable daylight & barely marginal inside viewing
 It's shame sound good
 Maybe that's AT&T; gives away free - hoping get rid them
 

think nokias, general, great
 particular nokia good looking
 basic, also
 dropped 10 times night (while talking always drop/break phones


) maybe 2 scratches it, most
 still works perfectly
 seems extremely durable, dropped calls, defects
 things matter phone, me
 5 stars
 

This Nokia simple basic telephone gets nowadays
You get good sound quality easy texting compact unit
The major drawback poor highlighting menu icon selections
If activated many features, cell frustrate you
It's crapshoot actually select
 I buy 2X magnifying specs order utilize menu features
Also, signal strength battery power indicators difficult see - minor points considering AT&T; functionality (damnedgood) rapid battery charge rate
The vibration indication incoming calls effective, ringtones adjusted easily
In regards pricing, AT&T; sometimes give cell free activating two years service
 The highest price AT&T; ever charged Nokia $9
99, refurb condition
I've Nokia half year, I appreciate it; it's perfect, useful
 A phone phone, portable entertainment system
 Thanks magnifier specs, I don't squint screen anymore
 

Phone awful - $149 phone available prepay $20 $25 free airtime? They send 'free" - lock 2yr contract charge 10x actual cost phone ETF
 Consumer protection needs come telecom "industry" needs come soon 

You buy "Go Phone" $20 $30 local stores simply stick sim card it
 There reason renew contract get simple phone
 Walk Walmart, pick new contract required
 

As seventeen year old female, I tend use phone lot
 I got phone without texting, I still love it
 I idea users talking backlight, mine always perfectly viewable
 Maybe need teenager work it
 ;PThe problem I phone I nickel allergy, metallic looking finish menu surrounding buttons caused face break rash, long I use easy-to-use speakerphone button, get good cover headset, I fine
This phone easy even 60 year old father computer inept mother figure out, minimal help me
 I wish record function wasn't scratchy I could record songs ringtones, expect people afford texting ringtones
I would give 4 1/2 stars, I can't full five stars product
 









































































The Andrew Extensis great product
 Remove Baby Bell service home business, plug unit phone jack cellphone cradle
 From phone home business, including cordless phones, operate exactly like always have
 The benefit?? You features, plan advantages cellular phone
 It great small business owner take phone leave, leave place allow calls go voice mail
There one potential fault
 To place Nokia phone cradle, one sets cradle phone vertical
 After latches, gently leans toward rear unit
 I accidently broke one I remove Nokia phone without damage, must tilt phone front cradle removal
My concern device





 I wish Andrew units available phones Nokia 5100/6100 Startac
 Once phones longer available, do? I hope
 

The Andrew Extensis great addition home
 I run phones house Extensis saved $20/month (relative cell landline service) using device
 It's reliable allows extension phones throughout house rather carrying cellphone room room
 Given fact increasing numbers folks using cellphones principal telephone (see New York Times August 2003) it's surprising item discontinued nobody else seems picked concept
 

I use 2 line cordless phone throughout house
 Line 2 cell phone, courtesy extensis
 Now, I use cell phone (via extensis) throughout house without losing call due poor cellphone reception
The problem I I upgrade phone, I get another extensis (since Andrew Corporation stopped manufacturing devices)
 
























































































































































































































































































































This merchant, AccessoryOne, blatantly lying say battery "New
" I got order today battery obviously new:1
 It sealed package; loose tiny plastic bag
2
 The paint scratched edges
3
 There greasy fingerprints it
4
 The terminals scratched phone previously in
If Amazon allows unethical vendors hawk used and/or counterfeit products new, whole market place concept they've created credibility
 

Battery good
 Long standing charge
 Very staisfied product
 Prompt delivery 

Bought second/spare battery work phone heavily used, helped lot
Battery arrived brand new lasted well year
 

This high capacity version battery
That info wasn't specifications, fact Nokia OEM battery
 It is, I wanted high capacity one
 

I quite pleased product I got last week
The reason delay Amazon, strangely enough, deliver Malta even though part European Community
 It looks if, since small country, discriminated against


Anyway I item delivered friend states turn posted home
 It got safely bureaucracy, late
I therefore limit purchases exceptional items only: like item would costed 5 times much Malta
 



























I lost charger Nokia 770 - good substitute
 Doesn't always make good contact - plug Nokia it, it's good idea check see really charging
 

Works well ,,, complaints 


 BUT I don't think it's faster 120 volts home unit 


 

What I need say? It inexpensive, charges phone
 Haven't problems happy purchase
 Has going 6 months still works
 

This review unlocked version phone, Cingular (or AT&T; nowadays) service
 I received phone brother (he used work Nokia Texas) phone broke (nokia 6102i) contract Cingular another year (yeah, sucks)
Background: I eligible upgrade yet, meant I purchase phone retail price (without contract) would run upwards $300 more
 So I got phone (unlocked) gift, switch-over relatively easy trouble-free
 I copied address book 6102i onto SIM card, I moved SIM card 6126, address book (taa-daa
)
 What I able move photos I snapped old phone
 Those I send via email, I saved onto microSD card able move 6126 (it microSD slot, read 1Gb card easily)
Features: I always liked Nokia
 This phone exception (except one I discuss later)
 It clam (ie
 flip) phone almost slim (but slightly lighter than) Motorola RAZR
 I like menu layout Nokia
 The camera 1
3 Megapixel resolution (settings 1,024x1,280, 960x1,290, 600x800, 480x640, 240x320, 120x160)
 The photos decent daylight, great poorly-lit areas (but goes every camera phone I've ever encountered)
I like black silver coloring
 No external antenna (sweet)
 The button side open extra (not necessary)
 The internal display nice large, colorful
 I like navigation keypad
 The textured covering rear flap different (I like it, 50-50 friends)
There plenty hands-free features
 There's speakerphone, loud enough used outside, Bluetooth connecting headset sending files, well voice dialing commands
 There POP3 IMAP4 e-mail support, audio messaging sending voicemails directly another cell phone, USB cable support (I haven't used yet)
There large 1,000-contact phone book room entry five phone numbers, e-mail Web addresses, job title company name, work home street addresses, birth date, etc
 The SIM card hold additional 250 names
 Other extras include standard stuff: vibrate mode, text multimedia messaging, calculator, voice recorder, calendar reminders, notepad, stopwatch, alarm clock
Hands-free features plentiful, well
 There's full Bluetooth connecting headset sending files, plus voice dialing commands speakerphone
 For hard-core emailers, also POP3 IMAP4 e-mail support
I tested quad-band GSM phone San Francisco/Bay Area using existing Cingular wireless service
 I got quality old Nokia 6102i phone
 Call quality decent
Now, negatives
 A minor drawback design MicroSD card slot located behind battery cover
 Although, don't need remove battery itself, need remove cover
 My beef battery life
 The 6126 rated talk time 3
4 hours promised standby time 10 days
 When I maxed talk time, I got 3
5 3
75 hours talk-time (impressive)
 Because I always phone, hard guage standby time
 However, I paired activated Bluetooth, connected Nokia BH-900 earpiece (By way, BH-900 earpiece sub-standard compared Motorola HS850, another review altogether) I got feeling battery life standby
 For half day minimal use (20 min max), standby rest day battery 20-25% capacity
 When I turned Bluetooth, I able go full day use still 50% battery capacity
 So seems Bluetooth feature activated eating battery juice (which makes sense)
 I yet find control tells phone automatically turn Bluetooth active device around
Conclusion: The Nokia 6126 nice phone many features
 I gate 4-stars battery life
 This must, especially frequent traveler (like me) use phone/Bluetooth earpiece lot
 Nokia improve battery life, easily done patch automatically turn Bluetooth Bluetooth devices around
BTW, phone still offered Cingular
 I came store 

A mistake I notice lot people making reviewing phone compare phones boast dual functionality MP3 player camera
 Nokia, opinion, always looked function form
 They throw certain features standard, features alone supposed selling point phone
 The 6126 PHONE first rest afterthought
 With said let start review
PROS:-THIS PHONE IS POWERFUL
 I never experienced lag phone, even viewing thumbnail photographs switching menu items (which WHILE listening music)
 My last phone, sony ericsson z525, notorious lagging menu changes
 What really blew me, I load nokia themes phone, could actually preview I simply scrolled it
 Anyone customized his/her phone theme knows LONG takes apply one(albeit seconds, thats eternity)
 This phone previews seconds
-THIS PHONE IS RIDICULOUSLY CUSTOMIZABLE
 change EVERY aspect phone, menu presents many minutes want phone wait hit snooze
 For really intricate stuff may take menu clicks find option, I customized internal displays 1)screen saver (when first close phone) 2) Standby screen (10 sec phone closed) 3) Flip screen (what picture external display shows flip open phone, you're holding ear decide people see)
 Thats 3 customizations IMAGE external display
 even options
-ACTIVE STANDBY
 This almost like start menu main screen, displays notes might entered day, status music player, scrolling shortcut bar that, again, totally customizable
 Oh, EVERY button main screen customized shortcut - almost never need go menu screen
-AMAZING SYNCING ABILITIES - I LOVE THIS PART
 You download Nokia PC suite Nokia website, do, complete bliss
 Anyone uses Microsoft outlook love quickly easily phone syncs bluetooth
 Transfer speeds quick many customizable options software (like whose numbers take priority, outlooks phones)
 The rest suite little cumbersome side since vista allows send files directly phone right clicking file, I find useful
-FLIP FEATURE
 Okay, sounds gimmicky
 But honestly, feel super suave
 With flip button pull phone flipped open ear one smooth motion
 No prying thumb flicking wrist, stumbling
 Just smooooooth :-)-MP3 ringtones - send em bluetooth, WILL need MicroSD card this
 Transfer takes seconds
 Plays loud clear
-Screen - I constantly keep changing wallpaper make use bright beautiful screen, external screen actually 262thousand colors, thats much phones main screen months ago
 The internal screen 16 MILLION colors, gorgeous
 Everything easy read, text messages web browsing
-FLASH COMPATIBLE


 A HUGE PLUS - know use it
 Flash lets animated wallpaper internal external screens
 I currently 3 3D rings twirling external screen clock
 Before I picture parking space lines actually told current time, I LOVE flash
 And since ext
 screen many colors, animations look beautiful
CONS:BATTERY LIFE - Not necessarily bad 2 days, sony ericsson spoiled ridiculously long lasting battery
 Even display said empty, battery would run additional 8 hours standby
 When Nokia tells die, lying
 Still, I disappointed battery life, although yet put HEAVY usage
LOOKS - I'm young guy (23) sorta want fashionable phone
 That said, theres really nothing outstanding design 6126
 Its practical, feels sturdy, rubberized outside helps grip, glitz glam
 It stream-lined hard eyes
 Its simply hard worker sorta rely screen savers stand out
MP3 player - YES, afterthought
 If want player thats integrated, would go 6555, lose flip function I believe smaller screen
 That said, still use listen music you're truly bored, lot people alternative music players nowadays
CAMERA- Grainy night, fine sunlight
 Gets job done need it
 Nothing special, again, phone doesnt brag feature rather considers standard day age
CONCLUSION: For price, I dont think phone beat entry level phone
 I planning getting Sony Ericsson, since slider, keys small flat I big fingers
 Plus I camera music player I dont see need (although I REALLY wish cingular would bring back Sony Ericsson K790)
 Also, I forgot mention, phones size buttons laid well make extremely practical use, another reason I prefer KRZR, useless flushed D-pad I cant stand
 This phone wont turn heads, keep you
 Especially like need jump menus quickly get agitated phones lag behind
 Look review youtube see action, you'll see I'm talkin about
UPDATE: Okay, figured extend battery life almost week (on standby)
 If you're like cheap get data plan, go MENU>SETTINGS>CONNECTIVITY>PACKET DATA turn Packet Data connection "when needed"
 This stops phone constantly connected data network saves ton battery life
 Also, first days, plug phone charge much possible
 Li-Ion batteries DO NOT memory, actually benefit partially discharged recharged again
 You definitely notice increase battery life days
 The battery needs "warming time"
 I hope helps
 I'm huge advocate phone
 

I read reviews I buy products, I little scared buy phone everyone kept saying battery life really bad, camera button always gets pushed "accidentally" pocket, sound really bad (in headset)
 Well, I bought phone used it, none became problem
 The battery life fine - people probably got recalled lithium-ion batteries
 Also, phone closed, keypad automatically locks camera button take pictures packet, whatever
 The headset little low, use "volume up" button, gets louder (gee, concept)
 Also, people complained camera "grainy
" It's 1
3 megapixel camera phone - pretty standard time
 Some phone 2 megapixel possibly 3 megapixel camera, expensive (by way, less megapixels, storage, I like I put songs phone ringtones)
There 6131 6133 phones available, FM radios, anyone even listen radio anymore? Also, phones say carrier them
 This one says Cingular, 6133 says T-Mobile, I think 6131 says Sprint, 6131 6133 available UK shipped there, I don't know GSM coverage (this Quad-Band phone, others may Tri-Band)
Long story short, works great, clip-on covers avilable scratches occur
 Also, I get bored looking black, I change whenever I feel like =) 

My wife I recently bought pair phones, based recommendation sales person AT&T; store
 The good news connectivity excellent (at least Washington DC metropolitan area)
We use phones business-like communication tools, personal entertainment devices (we way better MP3 digital photography devices)
 So wanted phone good phone I'm able comment music picture-taking ability
 What I'm happy follows:1
 The voice quality OK nearly good previous LG phones
 You hear distortion fuzziness
 Not show-stopper great
2
 You may well start throwing away manual comes phone - totally useless
 To use phone, spend lot time walking menus, manual help with
 The phone really excellent options it, definitely need discover yourself
3
 If want save phone's contact list computer, don't bother free Nokia phone manager software
 Like manual, basically useless
 You get pay for, go datapilot-dot-com purchase Datapilot software sure purchase bluetooth connector phone - Datapilot won't work Nokia USB cable requires proprietary connection device (in case phone, Bluetooth connector, way cool)
 Datapilot good product allow edit phone's contacts rational way
 That software plus Bluetooth connector cost phone does, works cell phones you'll able transfer contact list phones need to
4
 The phone uses Themes background graphic screen display
 That's fine you're teenager want fairly plain, business-like theme, good luck
 The phone, configured AT&T;, one theme
 Fortunately, plain ringer tones ultimately discover following #2 above
The Nokia basically decent phone lot capabilities, inexpensive purchased AT&T; contract
 Just prepared spend LOT time learning configure (and I computer systems professional)
PS: haven't problem battery life use cell phones intermittently charge every night
 

I've phone 5 months, compared previous phone, Motorola V557, Nokia 6126 sad
 I'm even going go full report phone, I'm going list pros cons:PROS:It plays mp3s, microSD slot space, bluetooth, display bright colorful, size pretty good - small ultra slim, I never problem antenna reception (which partly depend service coverage area)
CONS:-Battery life horrible - one phone call pretty much drain battery, starts go down, really goes fast
-The connector headset Nokia pop port, quite easy find difficult non-Nokia brand products
-The button open phone unnecessary caused phone open pocket several times
-The camera button outside resulting couple pictures taken inside pocket (the way I found fix turn automatic keyguard minute two)
-When someone calling, camera button pressed, phone answers speakerphone mode - I found today
 I suspicion little since mom would sometimes call would cut two three rings said sounded like someone one
 Turns phone bumped pocket, either chapstick hand I grabbed it, hearing inside pocket
-The camera horrible - really, really horrible
 Compared previous phone, pictures bigger, much noise
 Luckily, I didn't buy phone camera capabilities
-The outer display pointless
 I originally decided model another Nokia one outer display
 I thought would neat assign picture friends called, picture would display outside
 I never got feature work right - phone seems take long load picture I wasn't able receive calls, would ring twice image loaded person would got voicemail because, end, rang rang
-I never found way change phone lets know missed call, I don't think can
 All flash outer display every often (which REALLY drains battery) says "1 missed call"
 The main screen displays missed call open phone, doesn't make sound vibrate let know remind you
-The paint chipping exterior mine, like reviewers said
 It way one week
 This phone designed carry pocket
-The main display screen sometimes gets dirty
 It seems time collect every piece lint, dust, anything else air
 This wouldn't matter would flat surface instead embedded top phone
 It looks nicer way, good idea something maybe put pocket
 Again, definitely pocket-friendly phone
-The sound quality absolutely pathetic
 I discovered apparently Nokia thing, mom's sounds bad (she one old Nokia phones)
 The speakerphone bad, times think may better talk speakerphone rather trying listen ear piece
 Sound vary depending person's phone antenna reception, but, again, I never problem either Motorolas
-There aren't many custom features, doesn't seem enough buttons techno-type gadget
 Actually, basically phone people techno-advanced people
 It's like toy phone
 I've ever Motorola phones, I didn't realize much options new phones
 The main things I miss V557 option arrange phone numbers speed dial number rather alphabetically, Motorola's "iTap" text entry
 I would got another Motorola, I really didn't want Razor, slim phone matter
 Needless say, contract AT&T; up, I'll switching company better phone options
 If like features Motorola don't ever get Nokia
EDIT: After I could finally upgrade got Palm Centro, I gave Nokia phone brother broken ancient Samsung phone
 He used Nokia short time decided use another old phone friend gave him
 He also pictures inside pocket, phone also would open pocket button
 He waiting forever able upgrade phone allows MP3 ringtones could "House, MD" theme ringtone
 Even feature enough continue using phone, over-obsessed fan House (has cane, sneakers, etc)
 

I ordered phone form Cingular (ATT) today third defective phone came mail
 A customer service rep told 85% returns exchanges come model phone
 The first phone handset speaker didn't work next 2 were, words customer service rep, "DOA" -- dead arrival
 It would really nice phone worked though


 

I recently purchased phone AT&T; replace old, low-end Motorola V180 phone
 I basic cell phone user; I make maybe 2-300 minutes calls month, send text messages, that's it
 This time around, I wanted phone camera maybe MP3 player, 6126 fit bill
Pros:- Both screens excellent
 Large, bright, colorful
- The user interface good, much better old phone
 It's responsive customize phone's behavior
 The address book better designed
- Camera resolution (1
3MP) higher similarly-priced phones
- Call quality good
 It sounds better old phone gets better reception
- Looks feels nice
 With rubberized exterior denseness (like iPod), feels high-quality
 The keypad raised good tactile feedback
Cons:- The battery life terrible
 My old V180 would last whole week standby, cheapest phone could buy; 6126 lasts 2-3 days
 I fear bad it's going battery starts wear out
- All wired connections proprietary, won't able use standard USB cables, old wired headsets, even normal headphones
 Sure phone play MP3s, really going carry around set Nokia-specific headphones that? This part really annoys me, MP3 player portion useless IMO one major reasons I picked phone
 This complaint doesn't apply Bluetooth accessories, though still can't use MP3 player (no A2DP profile)
- Camera quality poor
 Apparently generally true cell phones
- Speaker volume low
Overall, I'm ambivalent phone
 I like design features, battery life proprietary connections really annoy me
 

I really tried research I purchased phone, unfortunately available reviews short term users
 I already expecting below-average battery life sub par camera, benefits I expecting outweighed concerns me
 The major problems began creep use
There several good points phone
 It really good-looking well-built phone, "feels right
" The sound quality excellent calls music (assuming stereo headset), even Bluetooth headset sound quality head shoulders old Motorola
 The audio player AAC/M4A capable
 The resolution LCDs great
 Nokia PC Suite sync phone's calendar Lotus Notes, rare feature
 I appreciate release button I thought I would
 I'm sure I'll miss next phone doesn't it
 The problem release button sometimes accidentally pushing pull phone receiving call
 If phone set automatically answer opens, release gets pushed accidentally, it's call don't want take moment, you're stuck holding phone closed stops ringing
 Still nice feature
Moving phone's problems: One might assume combination Bluetooth stereo MP3 playback phone would imply A2DP (stereo) Bluetooth profile supported
 Apparently, one would wrong
 Admittedly, I probably assumed specific mention A2DP implied phone support it, doesn't help searching internet yields mixed results issue, even Nokia tech support still can't tell one way other
 As I can't get work A2DP gateway, it's probably safe assume point doesn't support profile
The rest problems stem outdated Series 40 operating system phone's music functionality
 The music player tacked afterthought, severely overextended capabilities OS
 First, music controls cumbersome, using cursor system activate on-screen buttons rather using phone's keypad controls
 Track numbers may entered manually main player view playlist view
The phone apparently tested "large" music libraries
 I purchased 2GB microSD card soon phone, ready load music
 However, music transfer application included Nokia PC Suite develops problems trying read library anything 2000 songs so
 The main issue database meta tags breaks around point
 Nokia tech support informed test libraries around 1000 files under
 However, I'm sure I'm alone library around 10,000 tracks days
 Fortunately, load music files manually either data transfer mode phone, directly card
The problems don't end PC software, though
 The phone organize tracks subfolders; tracks within main music folder subfolders loaded one huge playlist
 For specific selection, either use clumsy folder navigation interface constantly reselect main music folder, must manually create playlists music transfer software, time consuming problematic issues I mentioned above
 I plan experiment generic M3U playlists, I don't high hopes
 And gets worse: filling 2GB card manually creating playlist every album, 77 total, attempting change playlists completely crashes phone
 It restarts reloads entire library
 For now, I'm navigating huge playlist guessing track numbers, although enter three digits
 It's almost humorous happens track 999: phone increments first 9 10, see track 10 000 (except last digit partially cut off)
 At track 1100, see 10 100 list
It begun feel like I'm beta testing software phone, even though I paid signed life away another two years get it
 It crashed ten times three months I've it
 I especially felt like beta tester Nokia tech support carry experiments large music library report back
 I'm still hoping major firmware update, I'm holding breath
 Frankly, don't seem interested working kinks mid-market phone outdated software components
I'd still recommend phone don't large music collection want use music player occasionally
 If won't use music player all, please buy cheaper phone doesn't it
 If large collection plan use regularly, situation, I'd highly recommend spending little something least Series 60 OS, buy Nokia
 

EXCELLENT phone
 research, find compared phones currently offered att, one least amount least pressing quirks issues
i love everything phone
 ease use, extensive cusomizations, high quality sound quality reception (which obviously two important things phone all


 one really best things 4 phones ive owned far
) bright, stunning screen


 sleek, stylish, highly functional phone
the caveats phone, numerous severe enough drop review 4 stars, decent battery life, 24 mb memory


 honestly think of
 

When I bought phone, I read battery wasn't greatest


 I guess I figured I'd charge every day didn't bother me


 But nothing prepared absolutely horrible really is
 If I talk maybe 20 mins listen couple songs, thing nothin
 (I even set packet data "when needed" didn't help
)It's sad would good phone otherwise
 The style cute little push button opens phone up, I really liked
 The sound little stereo speaker really quite good
 The reception good
 And format customizable (like Nokias) battery didn't drain like leaky faucet
I can't recommend phone unfortunately I'm going return mine
 And since I read 6555 bad far battery life goes, I guess year first time 10 years I've use another brand Nokia
 Oh well, I guess it's time change
 

A words wise, Don't buy phone


 I got phone upgrade w/ contract renewal, mistake
 This phone straight crap
 Let's say, don't EVER, EVER EVER EVER DROP THIS PHONE
I dropped phone One time straight stopped working
 I couldn't believe it, guess what, I dropped figured, I dropped stopped working, lets see works

 And Wholla
 It started working again
 I older Nokia, similar model
 phone would take lickin' keep tickin
 This thing, plastic w/ lights
 How many ways I say it


 GARBAGE
 

I lot research purchased phone
 Upon customers' review, I knew battery life would short purchasing
 However, I didn't expect charge phone everyday
 The battery bar went 1/4th I made hour phone call (the battery full made call)
 It's ridiculous short battery life is
 Plus, user manual isn't helpful much
 I followed maual set display date/year
 However, date/year displayed internal screen external screen
 So need open phone check date every time, convenient all
 Besides two cons, Nokia 6126 excellent phone use
 The signal/reception excellent
 The speakerphone function works well too
 The sound qulity bad either
 Overall, Nokia 6126 good phone use
 Since got phone free ATT 2yr agreement, I'm gonna return even i'm dissatisfied battery life
 

According cell phone websites, Nokia 6126 cancelled Cingular
 If still interested phone go unlocked Nokia 6131
 It basically phone, fm radio
 I cancelled order I found this
 

dunno expandable 2gb mini sd slot going make mp3 player pretty cool one
 that's 1500 songs adition phones memory
 

I've mine order couple weeks
 It's Aug 22 - Nokia 6126 begin ship? 

The phone many great features works well time
The battery life, I didn't expect much, pretty aweful
 Especially compared previously owned Nokias boyfriend's Sony W300i (similiar features useage runs circles around Nokia)
Three months use internal screen turn phone opened phone idle
 If I activate external screen I open phone, open close phone couple times, issues


but fear losing internal screen permanently, I phone replaced
AT&T; sent remanufactured replacement brand new phone
 I received today crashed loading contacts SIM card
For Mac users, phone compatible iSync, however plugin found websites
 I still haven't experienced full compatibility couple different plugins
Call quality good, antenna placement (it bottom) basically gives one position hold phone without disrupting reception
If plan use card reader SD adapter transfer files MicroSD, aware ringtones/profiles/ringer IDs programed data card reset default
 However, picture IDs remain, even images card
 The card isn't easily accessible I'd like be, I planned using card reader get around issues iSync cumbersome use Bluetooth File Exchange, mostly music
 I tried removing replacing card phone off, phone recognized card card inserted
Now, may seem like nit picking, internal screen flush top piece, maybe better discription it's considerably inset, protective covering
 Dirt, dust oils collects around edges screen quite quickly nearly impossible clean
 Sounds anal retentive, I know, looks pretty gross pretty fast
 Resist urge wipe clean - anything wipe screen ends crack
I've used past phones average two years more, somehow I don't see happening phone
 I'm pretty disappoined companies point
 

This phone deserves zero rating
 Or minus 1
 It's bad
 It turned reason, I important call someone whose number I don't have
 Battery half full, decided take break guess
 I turned on, works fine now
Other problems:- Buttons don't click even though seem work; don't "click" need tons pressure work
- Navigation menus cumbersome simple things like sending text message
- Sound bad reception transmission
 This good coverage area
 The biggest problem cuts reason
- Camera like trip back earliest digital cameras early 90s
 Picture quality bad, you'll wish never even tried taking pictures
- I never even use phone anything else phone calls
 I don't really care camera, mp3 on, I dissapointed even simple things like staying battery full, challenge
- Battery life bad
- Battery indicator worse
 You may leave home battery half full find it's getting empty within minutes
 And - yes - I charge phone fully, use battery (almost) empty
- Both wife I phone
 We use twice day
 Very light use
 Yet phones exibit identical problems
 Buttons phone got bad even faster mine - within days purchasing it
All I don't remember last time I dissapointed purchase
 This phone feels like bootleg black market import, real Nokia
 However I bought AT&T; it's real
 

The Nokia 6126 nice features (most also found newer phones)
 My gripe phone incompatible every PC-to-Phone software program available
 The program available "Nokia PC Suite" (free Nokia web site)
 But program can't near Cell-to-PC programs do
The Nokia Suite Phone cannot dedect contents Sim Card, Sim itself
 Hence, many features inaccessible
(Only Phone memory add Miro-chip memory available
)The contact list editor worst ever I've seen
 The Contact List core phone
 If want play mp3's - get mp3 player
 The sound quality severely lacking, bass all
If want camera - get digital camera clarity world difference
 That leaves us Contact List Editor
(1) Cumbersome pop windows entries, rather programs do, edited one single page printed out
 The Nokia 6126 printing, neither Nokia 6125 PC Suite
 (It allow print 1 Contact per page -- good luck printing 40 pages would normally fit 1 page
)There plenty sites discuss good points, I agree it's nice phone core reason phone, contacts appointment calendar editing & printing wouldn't cumbersome simply unavailable
My last beef battery life
 For purposes, standby gives relative sufficient time, use phone PC sync, one better hurry
Charging time runs 2 1/2 3 hours home 110V charger
 

I recently bought phone 20$ GoPhone losing Samsung Sync :( I fully prepared phone way Sync phone par better areas
Pros:The speaker amazingly loud-especially compared Sync
 Voice quality normal
 The cool thing play music anything else want
The screen vibrant big screen Sync many newer phones
 You even change main screen shortcuts calender like smartphone
Cons:The flip button works great unles accedentaly block flip finger
The sd card behind battery cover
 This problem unless take card lot
Battery life extremely short charge every night good
Overall liked phone much sync better respects 

Before owning phone I good luck Nokia phones, outside dropping things jumping rivers pocket
 I've phone 4 months I hate it
I never used extras downloaded anything, perspective someone ordered phone AT&T; made calls texted took maybe 5 photos 4 months:1
 It's ugly
 No style all
 I'm pretty practical twenty-something girl, I feel like old woman carrying thing around
2
 That neat-o button opens up? That cool week random openings got annoying
 The camera button obnoxious well, unless like inner-pocket photos
3
 The screen gets filthy it's hard clean corners
4
 Reception great
 I live East Bay, CA I've gotten steady 2-3 bars best
 My last Nokia got great reception even Santa Cruz Mountains
5
 Battery life terrible
 I don't talk much, I've charge almost every day
6
 It started glitchy got worse
 I problems low battery charged, seemed clear up
 Until now
 4 months won't stay on
 That's unheard of
 I'm going bother getting fixed, I'm sure I'm going buy another Nokia phone
 

This worst phone I've ever owned
 After several months paint begun chip off
 The voice quality fair best
 The battery life terrible
 Occasionally mike stops working battery needs removed reset phone
 When phone powered off, number settings (like default messaging center) disappear must re-added
I replacing phone soon won't another Nokia
 

I got phone replace beloved Razr
 I've one @ 6 months, I really like it
 The sound quality excellent, comfortable ear long periods time, plus
 It also highly customizable, another big plus me, well easy use- took @ hour set I liked
My complaint battery life, lacking
 I charge every two, dies
 This little aggravating , I've learned plug charger every night, problems
Overall, great quality phone
 

Nokia 6126 - I used phone year now
 It well built basic functions well
re: complaints others -Pl
 note protruding Antenna model


it embedded inside phone(below microphone)
 So clutch fingers around bottom phone talking, may feel call drop/fading
Battery life comparable phones
 Make sure Bluetooth set OFF used
 The battery-life indicator accurate
 The phone charger connector easy use simple round plug, unlike flimsy multi pin connector Motorola phones
The camera photos daytime amazingly clear
 Same wallpapers download
 Understandably, low light photos/ videos aren't great
Bluetooth perfect
 It syncs pc quick uploads/downloads
 I believe one could use music well
Call volume ok, bot exceptional
 The phone long, there's getting used ideal position ear
 Note cell phone cases tiny opening made earphone case slides call, may feels like call fading
 Use small scissor cut slightly larger hole ear piece
Outside display shows clock, useful
 The camera button close on-off button, good
 There also useful voice recording feature
 Since I didn't use phone music player, cannot comment
It may trendy phone youngsters, 6126 solid WORLD/ quad band phone
 Buy memory card case
 

I went 11 months phone started crash I tried send picture msgs
 But AT&T; you're warranty, they'll give model brand new FREE
 Two months went one night, I clicked menu button froze
 So I'm third one BUT I happy phone
BATTERY - I see quite people complain short life
 Mine really long life
 And I wallpaper mini screen running flash solar system uses lot power
 I charge phone I say every day
 Before I used still picture, I charged phone every days
 And I talk text take A LOT pictures
 I can't tell many days stand I can't go long without cell haha Either (1) I'm blessed good battery (2) first get phone (or phone), charge battery really long time times (over night 12 hours 3 4 times) really maximize battery [if charge hours, even though says battery full, won't hold much charge]
PAINT - Yea, chips really easily
 But phone I've owned since Nokia 5190
 Paint paint sitting purse pocket rubbing keys coins, paint come off
 Plus, it's phone
 So long works, it's fine me
 Looks shouldn't top complaint
SOUND - Excellent quality
 I LOVE speaker phone
 I love much I didn't bother buying bluetooth
 I hear person well hear fine
 And speaker it's closed awesome
CAMERA - Remember, it's 1mp
 Thus, I high expectations taking pictures
 But I impressed quality considering it's phone
 I zoom still picture quite nice
 You can't compare cell phone camera digicam cell phone cameras I've had/seen/used, one top 5
 With cell phone, don't buy judge quality camera
 It's PHONE, digicam
 As pictures inside pocket/purse, keylock phone closing it
 Or set keylock automatically
 Simple solutions simple problem
SIGNAL - I find family members receiving signal I not, I turn phone again, I'll get reception they're receiving
 Considering I live urban area, cell phone signal pretty much strong everywhere
 But I go National parks mountains away cities, I get decent reception
 Not full bars enough send msgs make calls
USER FRIENDLY - I love every little detail changed adjusted mood desires
 I get bored seeing things again
 But phone, I go menu tabs grids
 Colors, fonts, tones EVERYTHING customizable
PICTURES AND INCOMING CALLS - If phone closed, yes picture assign contact show outside
 I got I got cell updated software
 The first one I (over year ago) feature
THE FLIP BUTTON - This first flip phone I would pull open I it
 Then I discovered button
 I love button
 Even month pulling open phone, still worked fine
 The button necessary use
MP3 PLAYER - No opinion
 I don't use it, sorry
One con - The software glitchy
 First phone 11 months, would crash I tried sending picture msgs
 Second phone 2 months, one random day, decided whenever menu button pressed, phone would freeze
 I swear it's running Vista
Yea, I'm third one phone
 BUT I love it
 And I love features I customized specifically me
Remember, AT&T; you're warranty it's still valid, get phone FREE
 If you're battery life sucks, tell they'll give new battery FREE
 Software gets glitchy, get new phone FREE
 In Northern CA, go DSC (Device Support Center)
 Ask retail store locations
 

I 6126, I use mainly internet access AT&T; Media Net (web internet) prepaid service
 I LOVE IT
 I able install Opera Mini (free operamini
com, go phone) Games folder
 I use phone mainly web browsing, Opera Mini comes pretty close normal web browsing experience
 I signed pay go AT&T; means took month I sign unlimited Media Net
 Still, it's really useful even that
 This seriously good web experience price
Eventually I may need upgrade phone service get tethering phone capable things well I'm using yet
 So phone useful long time come
 

Had VX8500 year now, pretty satisfied
 I bought 2GB card it, use constantly listen MP3s books
 It couples well Jabra BT8010s, good sound quality music calls
The camera pretty good too
 With right light, take nice pictures
The touch controls work well mine, easy get used to
It's even inadvertantly dunked glass diet pepsi, still works like charm (after dried anyway)
Battery life great, I don't use MP3 player, battery last 4 days charge (1 2 heavy use)
Build quality pretty good, I refurb unit due fact screen first unit blanked (Verizon happily dolled new one though)
All all, I'm pretty happy VX8500
 

I can't think anything gush phone
 Usually I like Nokia's disappointed one
The sound dips listening caller
The moving display front screen annoys end difficult read
 It large screen front, yet 10% utilized
 The time number missed calls etc moves screen
 Why?My hope perhaps I feel like reading manual customized
And battery



it CONSTANTLY beeping needs recharged
 It ridiculous poor battery life is
Basically, generic phone me
 I struggling find reasons I like phone others
 I can't think feature makes stand rest
 

I bought plan first bill came extra 30$ kinds extra charges end paying 100 $ per month verizon , rather 69
99 shown amazon page
 LG phone good speaker phone sucks
 I read reviews abt battery life, let battery drain completely recharge compltely couple times, gives 3 days bluetooth on
 ont talk much, shd give 2days even talk lot
 

I 2 phones sent (the first one bad)
 Each problems hearing device
 It would fade out
 The software auto voice dialing weak, required repeated input
 I went back motorola
 

This worse phone I ever had
 At begining ok 4 month phone start get numbers even I want make phone press buttom, phone gets last I got before


 

Like rate plan, like phone
 Don't like way Amazon fulfilled order, however
 Evening day #1: I placed order
 Day #2: Amazon runs credit check (as cellphone vendors do) I'm approved; order status changed "not yet shipped" "shipping soon
" Later day, Amazon send email let know they've shipped phones
 Status changes "shipping soon" "shipped
" Day #3: Amazon send email, advising new phone numbers
 Days #4, #5, #6, #7, #8: Still waiting
 Day #9: Phones delivered
 OK, phones actually arrived time period Amazon said would
 So I complaining? Because Day #3, Verizon assign phone numbers activate phones
 So I "privilege" paying phone service days #3-8 without phones possession
 With family plan 4 phones, $18, plus taxes fees, straight pocket Verizon's
 Gee Amazon, thanks "favor" activating phones six days early me
 

Let start saying 4th cell phone 5 years, far best phone I've ever owned
 Phone ergonimically correct, touch wheel (similiar ipod) buttons surrounding wheel (also touch sensitive) work flawlessly amazing
 You set different sensitivity levels touch bad buttons awesome
 The feature I enjoy phone bluetooth
 I purchased platronics Voyager 510 (works flawlessly advertised 30ft range) along phone two pieces hardware match made heaven
 You add multitude contact information phone number saved phone (email, fax, home, cell, work, picture, custom ringer -phone call, custom ringer -txt msg, place contacts group) screen display top notch well
Some Cons, buttons along side phone bit hard press indented phone prevent pressed mistake
 Would nice LG put single, double, triple tick marks buttons could least become familiar feel function button
 The latch charger USB hookup seem bit flimsy I believe ultimately break prematurely
Last thing, didn't know VCAST worked certain areas
 If you're verizons ED-VO area coverage cannot use feature
 I'm Santa Barbara I get coverage, checked local cities


Ventura, Santa Maria, Thousand oaks covered either
 However, Pasadena Los Angeles covered


not sure helps anyone thought I'd their
 

The battery hold charge - don't buy phone unless want talk phone plugged wall
 I nokia phone 4 years I bought phone I loved it
 As soon I I replace phone
 

The phone OK
 BUT


it doesn't come anything wall charger
 If want load music onto buy mini SD card data cable (sold seperatly) If want LISTEN music, buy special earbuds fit phone
 (DUMB)I bought phone 15 year old son
 How many pairs Nokia specific earbuds I going buy?????Really RIP OFF ask me



Keep looking
 Don't get one



 

The phone pretty good, feels comfy hand bottons protrude "click" gives nice tactile feedback, something missing almost every phone markey
 So know you're pressing times, almost texting errors
However, two flaws, one MAJOR
1
 How phone input earbud? This absolutely unacceptable, I've never seen phone last 6-7 years simple ear bud jack, ridiculous
 This sole reason I returned mine, I care Bluetooth, I prefer simple corded earbuds cheap replace lost
2
 Another pretty serious flaw battery
 It rated 3 hours, pushing it
Overall could great phone, two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like including basic earbud jack ruins it
 











































































































































































































I love hold 1500 songs black white 














































-they hadn't designed attach phone coiled wire
 shorter straight wire? wanted retractable thing wouldn't fight wire anymore
 i'm still fighting it
-it weren't big phone-the earbud weren't delicate
 reason i'm still using because, first one bought utterly failed 10 minutes use


 argued customer service hour two, sent back nokia, demanded money back


 sent new one
 one still works year


 i'm careful argue wire
 

Having Nokia go phone hands free headset I get it

 Great value
 

It works I hands free talking phone
 But It well designed 'cause headset little awkward put ear
 The connection cellphone sometimes well especially move
 There comes noise
 

I've using Nokia cell phones years first time I've ever used headset
 The model phone (6010) doesn't lot variety far headsets go, I bit worried I going get
Most friends kind headset microphone hangs mouths


 I've always personally never liked


 looked awkward nice look at
 But one first things appealed Boom Headset sleek design
 The microphone ear piece connected small, discrete, black unit hidden whichever side face use on
Another element I love headset small button hidden earpiece answer hang call
 I find helpful I'm driving
 Before I take off, I place headset ear leave phone cup holder
 When I get call, instead reach search phone's answer button, I keep eyes road, reach ear, click button I'm talking
 Then I hang up, I press button I'm disconnected like that
Having headset great I use phone things
 It lets multitask
 And may seem like big deal, able things without balance phone shoulder head really great
 I use computer, cook, walk around house, ease headset
Since phone doesn't support Bluetooth, I settle wired headset I say


 next best thing wireless far headsets go
 I've asked friends quality I sound say it's great: good volume, static, interference
It looks nice, sold great price Amazon (a bit pricey Nokia's website), it's supposed do
 This product highly recommended
 

Nokia phones, rule, work 'standard' plug accessories
 Even though after-market manufacturers frequently advertise headsets appliances compliant Nokia models - not
 If look closely plug 'universal' plug appliances, see TWO narrow black rings around metal pole plug
 On Nokia, plugs THREE bands required and, generally speaking, made available ONLY Nokia
 Most/all market brands 'universal type' correct width plug, two bands - things don't work Nokias - I purchased returned enough know fact
To complicate situation, Nokia accessories work correctly Nokia phones - even model phone sometimes accept particular accessories sometimes not
 This Headset one device
 Because want phones, cameras, video machines, internet access voice mail - wife I use Nokia's simplest GSM phone, 6010
 We actually three family
 We bought three headsets found works perfectly one them, intermittently second third
 All three phones identical, purchased time work perfectly
I infer experience two things
 1) The Nokia brand makes it's adapters differently enough after-market (less expensive) brands might buy use cell phones work Nokias (smart manufacturing integration, I suppose - especially customer friendly), 2) even branded accessories, functionality inconsistent
Nokia makes good phones - owning one locks using accessories - work quite well, intermittently others all
 Let buyer beware - prepared spend time, effort cost returning things
 I wouldn't buy Nokia reason
 

The product description Amazon's web page indicates headset compatible Nokia 2600 phone
 So I ordered two together, neither one worked Nokia 2600
 Since seller would refund purchase price original shipping charges, I pay return shipping costs myself
 So I'm back square one headset phone -- less money bank before
 The reason I'm giving headset one star I wasn't able proceed review unless I rated least one star
 

This headset worked nokia 2610
 Sound fine people said could hear fine
 The ear piece little uncomfortable probably something I'd want use hours end works
 

This listed working Nokia 2600 cellphone
 It not
 Buy beware
 

getting older fun - particularly advent cell phone
 No matter high volume cell phone, slightest background noise I could hear conversation
 I found Nokia HDB-5 Doctor ordered
 I hear everything fine now
 Its good product money
 

I researched ordered Nokia Boom Headset (HDB-5) Nokia 2600, suppose work Nokia 2600
 Upon receiving I disappointed I would plug Nokia 2600 kept coming message 'enhancement supported'
 I tried everything get work (including taking cell phone store asking I something wrong)
 They couldn't even come answer
 You need take Boom Headset (HDB-5) list enhancements Nokia 2600, work model
 As see gets low rating me, since didn't work cell phone
 Your list enhancements misleading right I hands device Nokia 2600 misleading list
 

This would great little headset, mine poor connection near phone end makes static wire moves
 There also problematic hang-up switch boom; it's problematic I often press end call I'm putting thing ear
 

Bought several months ago
 It DOES work nokia gold phone
 Works fine drawbacks are:No way boost volume adjusting phone volume
Wire could inches longer
Rubber part earpiece breaking flex point
I don't know I'll try buying one look one stronger design
 Overall fine, didn't last long earpiece started breaking down
 

I used headset frequently 6 weeks
 It didn't hold microphone quit
 Probably wire pulled apart stress (bending, stretching, taking jacket?)
 I didn't get ripped off, since I paid $5
54, I got I paid for

Beware aftermarket imitation car chargers, cause damage phone possibly damage car
 There cases phones caught fire phone using aftermarket batteries and/or aftermarket chargers
I initially misled prices really cheap aftermarket chargers
 The first one I got defective, I got another one caused interference car's electronics system
 The speakers would make weird popping sounds
 And even then, sometimes phone wouldn't charge
 When I replaced genuine Nokia charger I bought Amazon
com, everything perfect
 The phone charged properly pops sound system gone
 Don't misled prices aftermarket goods, cause damage phone car
Amazon
com selling real deal, genuine Nokia &quot;enhancement&quot; absolutely bargain price
 Get now, never find better deal genuine Nokia product
 

I bought charger back Nokia phone I'll agree reviewer - It good quality cannot beat price
 Too bad Nokia phone isn't built good charger - I wouldn't shop new phone often
 

it's cheap
it's easy usebut I chose wrong type, doesn't match phone
i can't use right now
but looks good
 

These simple earbuds identical original buds came phone
 Nothing fancy, simply work
 

I disappointed item
 What kind earphones come one earbud? It doesn't make sense
 And worst all, discription didnt even mention came one earbud
 Dont waste time product
 

These work perfectly company satisfied services
 I continue purchase items like customer services like 

This headset last months baby it
 They're cheap buy half dozen, throw stop working
 

My husband uses headsets time
 He would lost without them
 

Although description said earbud Nokia 6350, not
 Was able connect inserted plug
 Had return them
 

My experience accessory making dislike Nokia brand even more
 Why can't make earpiece works ALL Nokia phones? But no, would easy customers would forced buy new accessories upgrade phones
 Anyhow, I Amazon search phone model one first pop list sorted relevance, I assumed would work phone
 What stupid mistake
 Maybe I done due diligence read whole description list, something compatible pops FIRST deceiving
 

Just like originals I years ago I got phone
 Very satisfied quick delivery
 I originally bought three bought four more
 I bad habbit stepping earpiece ruining them
 Now, reasonably priced I don't get upset ruining anymore
 I grab next set
 Way better microwaves side head
 Worth every penny
 

This little headset works great ancient phone
 I happy able find online reasonable price
 When current technology, went lot money
 Only issue needs replaced twice year connection tends weaken time
 

This good cheap works well
 Use enjoy it
 I likes much I using one year keeps working well
 

This really good product
 Voice clear also fit ear perfectly 

I would suggest go product looking 

CheersBob 

I keep losing headsets dinosaur cell phone
 This replacement incredibly affordable far I've problems working
 It would nice able order one save shipping, discount shipping cost seller ordering one seller ( AccessoryOne )
 

I like better Bluetooth products
 It easy never needs charging
 

The first headset much static unusable
 Replacement sent charge, problem
 Gave up
 The company great work with, product piece junk
 

It really amazing price
 My phone old blue tooth so, perfect solution keep phone landfill 

Excellent face plate, hard find due old phone model
 It fits perfectly, packaging good
 Thanks
 

I bought called extended battery longer stanby time phone 
 Boy I disappointed
 This battery supposed Nokia No way is

This piece garbage NEVER EVER held charge 2 days
 My old used battery I already phone held charge least 4 days "Extended battery
Do Huge favor buy replacement battery cellphone dealer NOT Amazon 
com
These batteries worthless junk almost like A Cheap Knock 


Buyer aware 

I wish Amazon slot NO STARS 

 

This battery recycled used cell phone
 The power hold even one day
 

Nice case, I bought mostly phone won't fly apart I drop it
 The case covers power button phone, power button still works fine case
I charging stand hold phone upright it's charging
 The case cutout charging socket, thickness leather, phone doesn't connect charger
 You still use travel charger, use desktop charger I'd need take case off
 

I'm happy charger - charges Nokia 3595 quickly
 Absolutely problems
 

Advertised brand new, battery arrived semi-sealed plastic enclosure, won't hold charge
 It definitely used
 I got ripped off, recommend seller
 

Two Loops provided head set
 The loops made hard plastic
 Both broke place within 2 weeks
 Nothing provided put head set in
 Voice recognition sensitive change tone name recognised
 Hearing conversations good
 Volume buttons little small use
 

I used together Nokia 6600 worked well communication-wise however little bulky get little uncomfortable worn long
 I real problem ear pieces quite sturdy extra one included well
 Given wireless headsets currently smaller comfortable I'm sure popular long though
However, particular one works advertised perfectly Nokia 6600
 

This headset integrates seamlessly - took whole 30 seconds set pairing (that's Bluetooth technobabble) get running
 However, design may look cool, unless it's worn "so" it's actually painful wear
 There's padding over-the-ear plastic loop, hard plastic earset
 To really hear well, need press ear - feel good
 It causes ear loop pull ear, plastic earset smash ear
 If you're quite environment, it's great - car windows open A/C high, you'll hard time hearing
I tried use gym - forget it
 I cup hand ear press headset ear
I like Jabra's ergonomics better - it's really comfortable - gave getting work 45 minutes trying
 It would pair, would NOT communicate
 I returned Jabra ordered Nokia
 I'll keep Nokia - works flawlessly
 


The microphone howls soon phone connects thenetwork
 Works great games radio
 

Amazon dosen't carry picture case website search nokia ctu-24 google see picture websites, I knew I getting, hence I dissapointed 
 Why 4 stars say? There opening charge 3650 case, isin't


what nokia thinking?


but case well made inner lining case soft scratches phone's LCD
 Of course like reviewers said - can't make receive calls phone case
 Well cases cost 25+shipping one's 12
99


so it's compromise

 

This really great case
 It seems high quality leather
 The stitching solid even way around
 It horizontal case strong belt hook
 I've worn couple days I hardly notice belt
 My Nokia 3650 phone fits snug inside soft, velvety insides, giving phone smart, soft, scratch-free compartment
 The case closes good velcro flap
 The Nokia silver black label adorns front flap
A previous reviewer didn't like case due fact take phone case use it
 This true, however, wear pants lot, quickly open remove phone case
 This case $25 Nokia Web site (as 10/2003), price (12
99) great
 I highly recommend case
 

I thought case going made specifically Nokia 3650 phone clear opening see screen little hole camera shoot pictures
 This case nothing sort, cannot operate phone remove case
 

Good: Quality piece - thick leather soft inside -feels substantial solid
 Protection - I dropped phoneon hard floor maybe two dozen times screen cracked
Horizontal position unobtrusive fits well car seat belt
Mediocre: Convenience - getting phone maybe difficultwhen hurry, case belt
Poor: The spring holds case belt steel,but rather plastic
 Therefore going drop phonea lot
 I almost lost - dropped I wasgetting car parking lot
 

I excited I received package,to disappointment even close I imagine
like customer newark, I thought case clear opening see screen little hole camera lens
I'am busy Mom five children
I dont think I would even time remove cell phone case make call
 

Worthless


 totally agree 1 star reviews
 Anyone know get one allows use phone WHILE case? Amazon shouln't even carry piece junk
 

This transaction great battery arrived quick manner works perfectly
 Only thing I able understand it's little bit tricky get battery snap place putting phone? The origianl BL-4C came phone fits great new one extra Nokia Hologram requires slight force get snap battery compartment
 

I bought replacement battery phone $10 (instead nokia $50)
 The one received scuff marks like used it's life hardly better one replacing it
 I sure charge every two days suddenly dead
 lame
 

The new battery I purchased doesn't seem good original one, needs charged frequently, although price low I think quality low too
 

I purchased new battery phone old one needed recharging 3 4 days - well brand new one needs recharging 2 days - sucks big time
 I ended using old one lasts longer
 

Before buying, I read reviews concerned battery's quality ability hold charge
 The shipped battery one bar showing
 I plugged charge overnight, next day, saw still one bar
 I return contacted company RMA, sent immediately
Before I got around mailing back, I tried recharging battery different outlet, charged fine
 User error: power strip defective (likely damaged recent power outage); battery perfectly good
Important: I followed recommended procedure charging new batteries
 I charged fully let discharge fully, past "low battery" warning juice all
 I ran complete cycle twice
 The battery performing fine
 I get several days standby enough talk time
 (I NOT heavy cell phone user
) 

For us haven't moved smart phones, don't want pay extra every month anyone much time hands email us we're driving highway we'll instantly know feel compelled respond ("Sent 


", aaaarrgghh); us still like relative simplicity ancient Nokia flipper, replacement batteries getting harder harder find
 My five year old Nokia dying full charge, found replacement Amazon, arrived two days ordered, overnight charge, phone working like new again
 I gave battery 5 stars, extra stars available I would give Amazon HollyCellular extra stars looking us (relative) old goats prefer keep lives sane simple
 

I received battery good time prompt shipping
 Unfortunately, worse battery I replacing
 I got approximately 4 6 hours life standby primarily

The company responsive professional promptly sent another battery
 The replacement bad first

Unfortunately, I use another phone since I can't find good battery

This standard Nokia BMS-2S battery comes Nokia 5100 series default
 The stats battery per official NokiaUSA
com website are:5190 digital talktime 3h-5h
5190 digital standby time 60h-225h
5190 analog standby time 1h30m-3h
5190 analog standby time 16h-26h
 

battery comes phone, frills
 box, took cycles get hold charges better
 yet meet advertised talk times digital service areas
 

I Nokia 5i60 phone, use quite often
 When I bought phone, came NiMH battery
 This battery last long, I bought longer lasting Lithium-ion battery
 With NiMH battery, I recharge every two weeks using average 15 minutes talk per day
 Using Litium-ion battery, I don't recharge two months
 I recommend battery big-time talker using Nokia phones
 it's better replace NiMH battery Lithium-ion
 

I got battery Nokia 5165 NiMH battery started fade
 Oddly enough, extended lithium battery less expensive regular (and I assume, slimmer) lithium battery, I bought cheaper one power, helpful forget charge phone
 The charge last lot longer, phone weighs ton
 That's thing keeps giving 5 stars
 

The BLS-4 came Nokia phone battery break-in period followed directed owner's manual
 However, 12 months battery started showing signs failing hold full charge
 The BLS-4 hold full charge two days minimum use
 The battery must limit recharging cycles
 I another Nokia phone BLS-4 battery, bought time one noted above
 This battery still holding full charge
 I also followed break-in period directed battery, difference two batteries battery recharged much first
 Maybe first BLS-4 defective
 The battery worked well new
 

I standard battery came Nokia's 5185, would barely last 36 hours entire time
 I got 1500mAh Lithium-Ion would last longer 36 hours always on
 It seems though doesn't want last 40-44 hours always without zero usuage phone calls/recieve, sitting idle
 But turn times know won't used time goes 3 4 days recharge
 I'll keeping reason, I test orginial one last long recharge thing blows





 

My wife uses er old phone alarm clock original battery finally lost it's life


 This battery revived phone allow use phone years come


 

Seems last forever 'always on' use
 Great talk times
 Irecharge every six 8 weeks
 Not sure 'each'individual battery 'made' (as I see unhappy)


 butMINE best thing happened N6160
 

As soon I started using vibrating battery, I happy know embarassing cell phone rings class


 anyway, I saw nokia batteries like selling like 70 bucks websites, i'm happy I found cheaper
 happy happy happy
 

While battery satisfy vibrating alert needs, adds lot weight size
 The phone still huge, much larger relative phone stock battery
 If plan carrying phone pocket, I suggest reconsider purchasing Nokia 7160
 

I bought vibrating shortly I got phone summer, I thought might solve problem carrying work ringer off
 I works time
 As long battery facing body works fine
 I still like battery plan buying second one I leave original battery emergencies
 

It adds bit weight could vibrate bit &quot;oomph&quot;, mentioned reviewers
 But get job done
 My one concern I've battery two years, longer seems hold charge long
 I drain discharge frequently, I still can't seem get last day two, even light usage
Am I asking much NiMH battery expect work like new couple years? Well, I'll probably buy another one
 But consider warned: doesn't last forever
 

vibrating feature battery great, strong expected be
 cannot feel ringing bag purse, pocket belt
 put phone table conference desk want people hear load
 otherwise great, neat vibrates time tune ring
 let battery run charging since first times used 6 months troubles
 

I've using nokia 5100/6100 series phones years, vibrating battery neccessary accessory
 No matter loud set ringer, times can't hear phone ring lot noise (football games, crowded restaurants)
 Other times might want keep phone silent, still able tell someone's calling without disturbing others
 I say don't keep phone pocket hip, won't able feel vibration though
 Also, warning letting battery fully discharge charging important
 If don't run battery fully talking frequently, instead letting discharge standby, extra careful
 All first batteries severly underperformed months due this
 

These extended vibrating batteries great
 They easily last 3-4 days one charge
 Also vibrating feature fun
The bad thing extended battery really adds weight mass phone
Another thing say since Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery careful charge phone particularly first times
 It recommended charge phone completely discharged
 DO NOT charge way discharged
 Otherwise mess battery battery performance significantly drop
 

The Nokia 900 mAh NiMN Extended Vibrating Battery anything extended unless counting time charger trying keep charged
 I mine 41 days already trouble keeping charged
 My phone 10 hours per day minimal talk time, Usually less 30 mins
 per day
 

This Battery vibrating battery excellent choice, I heard cell phone go ringtone I would always look see mine, But vibrating feature I it's me
 

The vibrating battery great idea people, like me, like see everybody staring cell phone rings
 I also annoyed people's cell phone ringing louder person next them
 A vibrating battery great solution that
This particular battery could, however, little stronger
 When I take bus subway, I sometimes feel vibrate, therefore miss call (which end world, way

) 

This battery pretty cool thing nokia 5165 Cell phone fit holder
 That small price pay vibrating battery
 The battery holds excellant charge
 Try battery
 

I Nokia 6162 couple years original NiMH battery wasn't holding it's charge well
 I held long I really annoyed new battery would cost almost much lot cooler new phones around I hoping prices would come down
 I bought battery coupon Amazon I'm happy purchase
 At full price, I'd still annoyed probably would've bought battery anyways I needed one
So far it's working fine
 It EXTREMELY light somewhat slimmer original batter makes carrying phone around much nicer
 The negative far doesn't seem last quite long charges (based general usage level) old battery
 However, we're still talking going days charges it's complaint observation
I'd say you're looking replacement battery that's simple, gets job done, lighten load bit, good buy
 If price comes find coupon it's excellent buy
I hope helpful good luck purchase
 

I bought battery months I got phone I could spare battery, I use main battery
 It lightened phone gave sleeker look
 The talk time I get battery better origainal, goes stand time
 If looking new battery one want
 






This battery important accessory anyone travels
 It small (credit card size) lightweight you'll never know it's purse briefcase need it
 The Nokia 282 goes batteries like son goes pancakes
 An extra battery takes much less space weight charger, fully charged replacement battery ready go save day
 





























































Too big car
 The microphone way big hard install
 I prefer headset next time
 Note: The size car kit like fist
 Before buy it, remember check car placing fist near car plug try whether stick car transmission not
 













Not compatible w/ Nokia N90
 product displayed w/ Nokia N90, even compatible
 pls change picture correct match
i kept product anyway gave dad
overall, svc prompt item works
 would still recommend
pls audit Phone Bluetooth compatibility
 thanks 

I received earpiece work, I contacted seller sent new earpiece received days later
 I would suggest call need get hold company
 I would order company again
 








































































































I got one clips, worked great part
 BUT - phone sometimes unclips falls sitting car chair falls floor
I happened walk close corner wall, stripped phone right off, tearing little clip part apart
I like phone within easy reach belt, trying decide whether go clip again, get something different
 

When I wear waist, antenna pokes side frequency, eventually antenna broke off, although phone seemed work fine without it
 Also I lean over, ribcage presses release button, causing phone drop I stand again
 However, I wouldn't use leather case since would interfere car holster phone locks via indentations side body phone
 

The Nokia belt clip works like this: there's round button 1/4&quot; deep snaps onto back phone behind earpiece end
 This raised button clicks short slot belt clip part, fastens securely onto belt pocket
 Because it's round, button-like clasp mechanism allows phone swivel, doesn't dig side leg sit down
 (At least 7100-series, anyway
)There's little spring loaded button top clip (the photo Amazon really upside-down) disengages round clasp lets pop phone
 The design pretty clever, works well
 The swivel mechanism allows stay semi-secure even driving
 I can't speak durability it, I've week
 But I like lot standard, hard-mounted clip
 

These best way carry phone I've found
 However, I'm third clip
 The rivet softer metals, WILL go these
 Fortunately, they're cheap, sometimes covered warantee
 They ARE much better leather cases, I've also tried
 

I've using clip Nokia 6160 around two years would replace anything
 I'd tried leather carrying case found clip centered low phone -- waist, I poked antannea
 This clip rides high phone making perfect belt, clipped inside bag
 The fact adhesive, fits case phone makes installation easy
 I highly recommend anyone looking quick, easy way access phone
 

I bought clip I wanted carry cellular belt
The basic design good - phone held convinient position belt didnt bother I sat work car
There two main problems previous reviewers mentioned caused stop using completely
The first one holding mechanism isnt strong enough, phone would sometimes get released I sat - nearly lost phone meeting rooms company taxis couple times
The one broke phone's back panel, forced take phone service center
 Lockily I bought phone clip Nokia, fixed without charge I still spend couple hours travelling service center waiting line fix
I resorted using leather carrying case - ideal doesnt break phone either
As guy wrote oldest review, I guess carries phone briefcase relies hearing phone's ring rather vibrations
 

I've gone seven clips last two years
 I can't warn enough -- don't buy this, you're getting short-term lease
I broke sitting car
 It turns doesn't take lot force placed bottom phone torque clip apart
I'm Amazon searching sturdier solution, meantime, phone stays pocket
 

I found clip, months, stopped holding phone well
 Then, 6 months, piece attached phone RIPPED section back phone
 Fortunately, phone still original manufacturer's one-year warranty, I using standard case ever since
 

This clip definitely useful, could made better considering much costs
 The flat metal spring held clip closed belt slowly deformed couple months, clip didn't close whole thing fell belt
 I found cheaper ones local electronics superstore didn't (but broke ways)
 If want belt clip, work, face it


this isn't last one you'll buy
 

All thing break
 I several broke within 2 3 weeks
 

Main problem clip button break clip does


However, it's 


 bucks SOOOOO convenient


I'd buy one every 2-months necessary
However, I three last year half
 One I lost, another I broke, last I lost button



Great product

Ignore negative reviews


you'll love it

 

Cell phone easily gets pushed disconnected holder worn belt sit certain chairs
 Lost phone way product
 Luckily found later
 Nice idea, needs improvement design us purchased one provided re-designed product
 

I think it's convenient, I like easy secure click-in, click-out functionality
 Like many complaints here, I've broken one last year (I twisted getting car it)
 I brought Cingluar store, replaced it, questions asked, receipt requested
 I'm guessing happens certain degree regularity, since costs 28 cents make these, I don't think mind replacing them
 If there's better option 7100, I'd love know it
Warning - you've got nice belt actually plan clipping thing it, clip damage belt time, wear leather finish
 I clip mine pocket now, although I'm sure I line inside clip felt something, it'd better
 Get one - you'll like it
 And breaks, bring back phone dealer get new one
 

I broke 2 months' use; I'm retiring don't use mobile phone much


so, better go metal one
 





























The Body Glove &quot;Cellsuit&quot; best acc
 cell phones, since invention car-chargers
 I've owned product one year I could satifed proformance &amp; durabilaty &quot;Cellsuit&quot;
 This phone-case proforms all,(even higher price-points)
 If one truley wants protect &quot;beloved&quot; cell phone, &quot;This item A MUST HAVE&quot;

 The sleek case fits snuggley phone, provides excelent protection awfull drops, scratches, even occational case light moisture
 By wrapping cell &quot;Neoprene&quot;, Body Glove found great way improve life durabilty Nokia 5100/6100 series phones
 

Don't mislead fact item listed 6100 series
 It NOT work 6161 series (Model keypad Flip Cover)The cover fit phone, cover allow open flip/keypad cover
 Hence, can't answer make call on
 Rendering cover almost useless 6161 model
I found hard way 


 Just thought I'd let others know
 

good like 

































This without doubt best handsfree cell phone device I've tried
 I've bought: 1) Nokia earbud ( yech, it's stuck ear
), 2) ABSOLUTE JUNK GE/Sanyo headset &quot;D&quot; shaped thing go around ear (dadgumit, fell every time I tilted head slightly
), 3) Jabra earpiece (not better Nokia earbud, I don't care many shapes earpiece comes in, stick thing ear hope won't fall out)
The Bodyglove product works, works well
 There 2 small holes microphone stalk towards end, make sure don't cover decorative foam piece, ruins outgoing voice quality
 

I like earpiece
 Better Nokia Andrews version
Body glove fits snugly around ear, bend ear bracket fit eactly, earpiece good quality
 At first, I started shouting, cause I afraid tiny mice cheek wouldn't loud enough, everyone I talked said &quot;why shouting&quot;
 I think works even better Nokia phone
 I set phone auto-answer calls, I don't worry getting brain cancer cause I'm holding phone ear day
 Now I'll get hip cancer, carrying phone belt
 :-) Plus feel like CIA agent, earpeice tucked around ear, people look like you're undercover
 It's really funny answer call start talking, people think you're talking yourself
 I don't much use different color mic wraps, I'm ever LA, I'll make sure match leg warmers (ha ha) :-) 

Okay, I'll nice, thing look good sound exceptional (transmission reception), comfort level, I thought would great coming Body Glove, horrible
 I twisted bent arm goes behind ear perfection I still never felt like going stay place
 The thing VERY light, good thing I felt moving every time I did
 Finally darn thing fell apart
 One minute I talking


I get home, tell friend I call back, I disconect phone go take ear find receiver bit still ear


 To trash went
 Buy the
 Yes looks wierd fits, sounds great rubbery ear thing rarely comes off
 It come enough bug
 Either way avoid product
 

If plan use car forget it
 The microphone short sits along cheek
 This means whoever talking mostly hear car noise rather whatever trying say
 Add ear piece falls blink, I amlooking buy yet another hands free set car
 

(+2) plug phone securely, loose like cheap models
(+2) ear-bud hears clearly, mic speaks clearly
(-1) mic little sensitive pick noise
(-1) comfortable w/o glasses, hard wear glasses
 

I get it



use three times, earpiece falls right socket




the sound quality decent




but three uses ?? I returning going try Nokia Brand




what I thinking ? Body Glove makes wetsuits

 

I disappointed earglove
 It looked cool interchangeable foam covers all, I couldn't get work me
 The build quality left lot desired, several attempts fit comfortably, sort came apart, although I managed get together again
 Then I couldn't get earbud thing fit ear; I stuck right painful, it's padded, I positioned hovering outside earhole, I could hardly hear thing, especially car moving
 I much better luck competitor earpiece looped right around ear, broader speaker cover sat outside earhole gave plenty volume
 Another irritating thing earglove mute button, phone compatible cuts call instead
I don't want harsh since I think ear-thingies case finding one fits shape size ear best
 Maybe earglove would work well you
 Its shame buy one find out
 Maybe friend one could try size first, doesn't fit useless
 

I've using headset driving works great
 The microphone picks voice easily people hear clearly
 The ear piece works well
 I hear person end line without distortion
 It unobstrusive comfortable
 A great buy
 

&quot;The best I've found&quot; doesn't necessarily mean product perfect
 However, piece fits behind ear, doesn't fall out, like plain ear buds (I must funny shaped ears, I can't get stay)
 I admit, first one I owned fall apart (the rubber ring came earbud wouldn't stay I put back together), I chalked fooling around trying add parts ear bud make comfy
 So I bought another, left as-is, I've loved it
 I owned behind-the-ear headsets, none comfortable
As sound quality, I've never problems hearing person I've never complaints can't hear I'm wearing headset
In all, find trick keeping leaving alone, it'll stay HOURS
 Believe me, I've wear mine hours time
 

I expected working quality product lived advertising
 The sound quality poor wearer person I called
 The phone plug thick prevents cover pull down
 I would say compatible Nokia 7000 series phones
 I returning refund
 

Fits well sound excellent
 And colorful pads certainly color fit personality
 The ear band holds much securly place earbuds used before
 don't fiddle im driving would course defeat purpose handsfree

 Get one
 

state passes law must use one car






 won't using one
 people tell voice sounds tinny annoying
 it's flimsy doesn't stay ear well either
 it's glove compartment probably stay there
 

The Earglove cool looking hands free gadget, doubt
 The little neoprene dealies purely aesthetic I suppose style counts something
 And comfortable wear, also giving good audio quality end
 People end line tell it's hard hear, however, making pretty much worthless me
 

unit fits quite well, incoming sound clear loud, on/off feature cute
 But, according almost everyone I called using accessory, diffcult hear me
 cant figure problem is


maybe cut mike sensitivity eliminate extraneous sounds


anyway, need figure many others suceeded in, get mike sensitive enough pick voices efficiently
the styling nice, quality problems
 but, I cant make heard
 

(Note: I tried Nokia 5150
 Your mileage may vary
)Comfort poor
 Getting fit snugly takes bit practice, ear bud starts get uncomfortable 5 10 minutes
Reception OK
 Sound loud clear, seems susceptible interference RF devices (portable phone, stereo, computer, etc
)Transmission bad
 I tried calls several different people
 All complained could barely hear speak
 I finally gave it
Styling great, really doesn't make difference can't use it
 

When I bought this, I thought really cool
 I could change faceplates phone colors hands-free device
 Well, started come unplugged middle conversations, annoying
 Then, one covers split side
If get this, I would suggest picking cover sticking it
 If mess much, might tear

Buy Genuine Nokia accessories phone
 You waste time money buying market junk mall
 

nokia 7280 listed
I one want car charger 

We upgraded phones I needed charger car I orderd one car price Amazon deal
 Also, shipped quickly
 Then husband borrowed mine I order another him
 So two work well pleased performance
 These fast chargers work well
 I heard,however, fast chargers good cell batteries
 That wear batteries faster sure doubts ask phone dealer battery provider
 

My phone seemed lose it's charge I happened car
 I thought provider going supply mobile charger nope standard home A/C model
 I searched mobile charger directly Nokia couldn't believe price wanted it
 I figured I would make without one
 That I found one
 I problems ever
 I don't see possibly could
 Just simple quick recharging power go
 

I'm sure works perfect claimed work 2600 I bought one dad
 The product arrived within days plug wrong size phone
 Buyer Beware

 seems claim compatible many phones really 

I got I got Nokia 6600 years back Nokia 6600 lasted well I really liked I replace on/off button got spoiled 5 years I found I little use car charger I also spare battery turned impulse buy little use me
 However, work okay kind spends hours car may useful battery dies need most
 Another thing I found charger rubber/plastic covering wire cheap started turn white flake making useless that
 I guess get pay price advertised one shouldn't expect much quality although Nokia name tarnished little associated cheaply produced item
 

I ordered Amazon exactly I needed new Nokia phone
 This exact charger selling local cellular phone dealer $29
95
 I went home, typed item #, sure enough found Amazon much less
 It great deal kept phone charged road
 

Sleek, unobtrusive, works fine, cord right size intended use
 The cord short enough stays belongs doesn't dangle place
 Just right backup use trip, charges battery quickly
 I'm glad I bought it
 

This charger also works new Nokia 8200 series phones - don't need buy new one bought 5100 6100 series phones
 

This great someone likes added security car charger
 This one works great far
 

The little black tip end charger snapped inside 8260 leaving unable charged either car charger wall charger
 The ATT store couldn't extract piece told common charger phone 1 1/2 yrs
 More hassle I'd expect
 Sure, worked fast I'm bothered seems planned obsolescence manufacturers Nokia
 I don't like get new phone accessories every couple years
 Thumbs durability
 

Nokia, I say more?very expensive -YESbutit charges phone super fast -YESoriginal part -YESworks correctly phones - YES(search google can't understand I'm talking about)ONLY &#34;YES&#34; :) 

I bought product Nokia cell long time ago usefull
 Help I outside office house mantain charge phone 

Don`t waste money
 This doesn`t work
The product description said phone
 However It doesn`t charge phone all
 

Great product--works well made well
 Less half price bought local retailer
 Would recommend product Nokia phones
 

This charger available big box stores even Radio Shack
 The phone 5 years old technology changed
 The charger worked car Nokia Cell Phone 6230
 Thanks Amazon
 

The Nokia LCH-12 Car Chargers works fine older Nokia phone
 I got one cars
 Shipping prompt
 Amazon great reliable place shop
 

I researched several different types would work older Nokia phone found one pretty good reviews overall
 It also costs little actually made Nokia Nokia phone
 I'm thinking could I go wrong
 Not
 The reason I gave 3 stars somewhat bad review plugging car cigarette lighter recharging, I usually twist rotate little bit get make contact start charging phone
 Why I don't know contact area big enough charger plugin
 I older nonbrand one cost 4 5 dollars worked perfect 4 years plastic housing broke
 Unfortunately I could find anymore
 

This product serves purpose recharge cell phone go
 No need remember A/C charger travelling 

Item described, brand new
 I'm dummy bought wrong one that's anyone's fault mine
 

Did pretty good charging old bulky Nokia cell phone
 Charge time quick enough
Only drawback, minor one, lenght cord
 An overall reliable travel charger Nokia
 

Not much say


it plugs charges phone
 I couldn't ask anything more
 

While really simple cell phone charger- I must say-the cord short useful using phone
 I SUV, cigarette lighter rather low floor - I suppose complaint car manufacturer
 The cord makes uncomfortable bit short, I use cord speaking right
 However, OEM cord much better others I bought it
 

Although I appreciate car charger item get three description indicated bluetooth cell phone charger
 Wrong
 It's good cell phone
 

When I'm driving 30 minutes phone already charged
 With normal charger takes hours, really much faster
 

I'm middle pregnancy, I really need car charger
Amazon's description said model compatible NOKIA6102 flip cell phone, isn't standard regular size tip charging, would work NOKIA cell phones prior NOKIA 6102 flip phone
 The NOKIA 6102 flip cell phone new smaller charger end, due respect might I suggest someone grab NOKIA 6102 flip cell phone, car charger see "NOT" compatible, help prevent future
 Because I still pregnant I still need car charger, NOKIA 6102 cell phone
I due honestly appreciate fact Amazon least paid return shipping, since charger wasn't compatible
 

cord bit short flexible enough
 

The description said would fit Nokia N75
 It not
 I dissapointed
 Buyer beware
 

This car recharger works great Nokia 8260
 Also comes lifetime warranty
 :) 

I didn't put thru stress test works expected
 

Don't know I made mistake I received Nokia LCH-12 Car Charger ordered never got Bluetooth headset :-( 

I 1995 Saturn SC2, I can't use car charger, I guess long fit cigarette lighter, I unable get way
 

The Nokia Charger works great compared many chargers I used before
 I previously analouge Motorola phone one chargers plugged outlet house would take night charge usage 8 hours
 It became real pain
 So I went bought Nokia 5120i bought charger
 My phone didn't lose power days, did, I plugged charger started job
 When plug large end cigarette charger car, little light comes let know power going charger
 Than plug small end hole phone
 If phone on, recieve message saying &quot;Charger Connected&quot; another message 5 seconds later saying &quot;Charging
&quot; Then charger starts job
 If phone last quarter energy, take approx
 30 minutes charge full
 THATS FAST
 If 3/4 energy take 2-10 minutes charge full
 And battery continue last long time
 Just keep charging whenever energy lost
 I phone charger one year problems
 One complaint many people cord short
 Well not
 I Chrysler Concorde phone reaches fine
 The cord stretch 1 2 1/2 feet
 So answer question
 If questions, I recommend contact Nokia
 

Kinda hard get excited cigarette lighter adapter, I must say, worked reliably couple years
 Hasn't ever failed me
 Guess makes deserve 5 stars
 

I bought charger primarily road trips
 It takes 1 1/2 hour charge phone, hence might need much commute
 It however add advantage unlimited talk time car, whenever need it
The charger solid feel, appears good craftsmanship
 It proven durable
 I've owned frequently used charger 2 1/2 years now, I've never anything go wrong it
 In opinion, works better could expect long time
 It's kept car permanently since I bought it, exposed excessive Arizona heat weeks end
 With desert heat comes cooldown night, temperature difference it's exposed also great
 The charger convenient, little light show it's charging
The charger's cord "feisty" one, don't expect cooperative try stretch far
All charger expect charge Nokia phones (no surprises there?) long, long time, matter put through
 The charger reliable durable, I highly recommend it
 5 STARS


 

Charging phone house charger comes takes several hours
 By using car charger job done I travel work available use time
 Others said wanted cord longer I found perfect reaching outlet PT Cruiser husband agrees Dodge Dakota
 This great product I would highly recommend
 

The little black tip end charger snapped inside 8260 leaving unable charged either car charger wall charger
 The ATT store couldn't extract piece told common charger phone 1 1/2 yrs

I needed car charger Nokia phone want pay [$$$] one celluar stores
 The cord little short fine since still reaches passenger seat cup holder
 It serves purpose
 It's nice long cord way
 Thanks

 

I've Nokia 6185 phone 3 years
 In time I've owned 4 car chargers
 I sucked 


 allure 10-12 dollar ones sold big mass merchant stores
 These things junk
 Don't reliably charge phone flimsy break time
 After getting one wouldn't charge box returning one would charge (and finally died couple months) I recieve new Nokia one latest phone (Nokia 3285)
 What difference
 Works like charm, sturdy, I mention it's sturdy


 Wish cord bit longer it's great
 

I got Nokia 252 last month needed charger car
 I hard time finding reasonably priced one I found one
 It works great 
 The complaint I cord long - since I live New York State illegal talk drive time - I pull talk - inconvenience short cord miniscule
 

This charger helps charge battery go
 No time stick around house wait charger work spare battery office
 This gives added piece mind travel know phone always need get stuck side road
 everyone needs car adapter


 unless don't car
 

Unfortunately, description mistaken
 The connector charger far small model 6010
 While may work perfectly well listed models, 6010, don't buy it
 

I needed Car Charger Nokia Cell Phone
 I ordered required Nokia Car Charger Amazon good price
 The TOTAL cost less shipping handling cost Nokia
A bargain price new brand name part
 

After bad experience no-name charger (very slow: 4 hours still completely charged) Nokia mobile, one charges fast original ACP-12 home charger (little one hour)
It hidden green power LED
If isn't lit, turn ignition (duh)
 If still isn't, check fuse 12V outlet, mine blown previous car owner
 

ordered car charger particular Nokia phone, left charger overseas
 Was suprised VERY low price, shipping handling people make money
 So info site bad, charger work guess carries bag? A charger 2 bucks 8 buck shipping, pay $5 send back maybe end right charger, MAYBE
 All taking weeks accomplish
 Does time value???? Don't order does
 

Even shipping cheaper stores, actually works phone
 Unlike one purchased retail outlet work, even though promised would
 

This items simple purpose works fine
 

Had year
 Still works
 That's ask
 

I bought charger replace original Nokia cellphone charger another replacement charger Monster Cable
 This charger much better I before
 It sturdy wires pull base original charger
 Also connection charger cellphone good I don't worry charging whenever I move phone around
 It charges phone pretty fast, unlike Monster Cable charger (which charged fast caused battery drain faster), battery holds charge pretty well
 I think reliable charger I'm happy it
 

Using charger Nokia 6600
 It's hard charger reviewed
 It either works, doesn't work
 Happily case, works exactly advertised
 It charges phone lets use phone charged
 It long cord generally perfect automobile compliment Nokia phone
 

The Good: This car charger sturdy reliable
 It doesn't flimsy feel car adapters I used devices (CD player adapter particularly on-the-cheap)
 The coil stayed great shape, makes easier roll store hurry
The Bad: The cord *little* bit shorter ideal
 So, phone rest cupholder right next cigarette lighter, can't rest comfortably passenger seat
 (It'll right edge)
 Other adapters I've used (like CD player) work little better
The Ugly: Nothing ugly it
 It works fine, looks fine
 A little green light glows tell it's getting power
In short: handy little tool job
 Just little disappointed length cable, happy sturdiness
 

The little black tip end charger snapped inside 8260 leaving unable charged either car charger wall charger

This purplish faceplate terrific addition faceplate wardrobe
 Very nice want LITTLE hint color
 

The prime selling feature Jabra line headsets &quot;earbud,&quot; soft rubber cap anatomically designed fit ear
 The problem is, earbuds don't stay units securely, fall off, you're stuck headset doesn't stay ear you've wasted money
 I lost earbud first day I used headset
 Why? Because soft rubber earbud easily snags onto pocket linings, collars 


 everything 


 does, pulls loose headset falls *silently* onto floor
 I replaced earbud tried securing Elmer's glue, later, rubber cement
 Nothing works
 The way positively lose headset leave ear moment wake morning till go bed night --- practical
 Skip product save money aggravation
 

This particular faceplate real beauty
 A shiny black color, goes almost everything ultra-slick James Bond look it
 I love faceplate
 

Unlike fun trendy faceplates earth theme color distinctive look also compliments style
 Because neutral tones, won't soon tire it
 The color sheen makes color appear different hue different lighting
 The dark undertones keep phone looking new clean unlike lighter laquer looking finishes show every smudge fingerprint
 I often recieve compliments phone among company
 If you're looking fun change different look don't want lock phone novelty bubble-gum look, earth theme perfect choice
 

This product, great, mean faceplate, really looks shinny new
 When got made phone stand out
 :) 

The Nokia 5100 series great it's easy use, personalize
 The interchangeable face plates great enable add flair
 

teens there
 really [


] faceplate
 It resembles Chrons'
 awesome
 looks good basically buttons
 dont take word it, buy see think
 great
 love it, real head turner
 peace
 

I've wanting get year
 None phone stores seem stock, probably due fact deep, metallic green color looks like gray black ways off
 I'm EXTREMELY happy color because, though it's flashy, it's got class &amp; style
 The deep green comes alive sunlight, opinion coolest color there
 This faceplate also made Nokia, it's cheap market product, like lot there
 Try yourself


 













This silver think (maybe would faceplate Shark Silver)
 This pale, pearlescent blue keep happy current phone longer
 Now I want car color, too
 The lens original black 5160 faceplate cracked
 This beautiful solution
 This faceplate come key pad
 If need one also, read faceplate descriptions carefully
 Some come key pad, don't
 I've 2 days hasn't fallen bag yet, I can't say would withstand sort abuse
 I bet lens less shatter-proof original
 

I like color
 It unique seems though would go everything
 

I think phone plate sort &quot;loud color&quot; many people don't want sort thing
 So get new better color viewers look 
 

I love quality changeable face plates colors choices great
 

Seventeen dollars faceplate, bad
 This faceplate sure snazz phone
 The bermuda blue really hot color
 I'd recommend accessory anyone seeking add excitement spice world
 The faceplates easy use, special tools required
 

I like phone look different ring different phones
 This Bermuda Blue nice color, actually range colors it, plastic underneath almost purple
 It's favorite color
 I've recently got second 5100-series phone now, I've faceplate times
 The first one held well, considering phones tend take lot abuse me
 A dings detract look product
 

Great faceplate
 Very scratch resistant important me
 Awesome blue color
 

It's hard write review product





ummmmmm




basically, idea still great way personalize phone
 I personally think great color, that's preference
 If don't faceplate yet, stop boring, go get one
 

This true red, ever one
 Very visual, shiny (mmmmmm shiny
), real eye-catcher
 Two thumbs up
 

cell phone face plate rally cute since like red
 rated 4
that review
 

Nothing beats pure silver fashionability
 This faceplate gives phone ultra-slick look, fashion-forward, &quot;techie&quot;
 Highly recommended
 

Owned one see $


 amazon
com, Wow
 I gave double thumbs up
 This highly recommended
 

I bought faceplate another store use Nokia 6160
 It looks really nice it's one 'chameleon' faceplates - change color depending light
 It'll either nice shade green amber color
 I haven't seen many people 'chameleon' faceplate makes look even nicer
 I've never seen type faceplate I put on, looked really nice
 The nice thing getting OEM (Original Accesory) fits perfectly
This faceplate definately worth it, I've tried many generic types don't fit phone
 Now I'm using Nokia brand faceplate, fits perfectly
 

Since I bought first cell phone (Motorola StarTac), I've always clipped phone belt never really liked leather skin look covers phone
 When I bought Nokia 6133 rep
 told didn't make swivel holster, I seriously considered buying different phone
 I ordered aftermarket holster hoping would live standards I used far, I pleased product
One thing immediately apparent, way phone goes holster
 On Nextel i730 i860 phones, external display went inside
 With holster, external display faces out
 Although issue me, might chance bumping things, could lead scratching outside
 One convenience holster actually clips base part phone, use every function phone still holster
 You flip open, take pictures, use speakerphone, etc
Pulling phone holster little different others well
 This holster release side
 Since I left side, I use index middle finger release use thumb push holster
 It snaps back pretty easily, sure snaps sides could fall out
I've days, I hope continues please far
 



















I disappointed find charger charging stand, requiring plug-in charger operate it
 It also won't charge phone case, unless want dress undress phone every couple days, might want give one bye
 

This &quot;Charging Stand&quot; requires charger
 Considering price, come one
 I purchased use office, thinking I could leave charger came phone home
 No luck
 Be prepared spend another $30 charging unit purchasing replacement additional unit
 

Be warned, include charger
 I lost charger going replace unit


 useless without charger
 

I recently upgraded new Nokia 5165 adapter works great
 The new Nokia 5165 came correct plug cradle/charger
 Since new Nokia battery old Nokia, I charge batteries time
 To make sure plug works, look back make sure says ACP-7U ACP-9U
 

You charge phone spare battery time
 I know I desktop charger
 All take standard charger came phone plug bottom plug desktop charger, BANG set use charger
 

I realy like desktop charger allows place cell phone charging crattle, able charge spare battery time
 

This home charger great
 I like keep back-up battery charged charger handy
 You charge-up spare battery it's self, phone it's self, put phone spare battery charger together charger charge (phone first battery)
 

An excellent product, allows charging spare battery nifty Nokia phone time
 I would highly recommend item
 Trust Genuine Nokia accessories Nokia mobile phone
 You'll pay (in ways one) buying market accessories kiosks mall
 

Item arrived quickly works great
 

If 1 battery, stand great
 It 2 slots: front slot phone battery, back slot 2nd battery
 While I using phone battery #1, I charging battery #2 stand
 When battery #1 run out, I use #2 charge #1


 Ergo, I always fully-charged battery
 











I bought two ear pieces 8260 phone
 Neither worked nokia one terribly uncomfortable
 Then I found one specifically 8200 series
 It works great
 I love on/off switch, I never reach phone all
 The ear pieces comfortable sound clear
 I highly recommend
 Try it
 

This Jabra unit, one listed compatible 8200 8800 series, work 8260
 A The phone detect headset attached
 A Jabra support person told known compatibility problems Jabra headsets designated series Nokia, however, according Jabra problems resolved
 I exchange unit try again
 Note many 8260 bundles come Nokia headset included
 

The cord Jabra two feet long clip provide cord, must coiled pocket carry phone belt keep way
 None 6 ear buds included fit well, unit sticks ear far, people end phone calls tell sound quality stinks
 

This earpiece works wonderfully Nokia 8260
 I don't know people problems
 People hear clear bell, I hear clearly well
 It sits nicely ear, rather stuffed like earbud type came phone
 The on/off button handy well
 

I'm truck driver I'm constantly go phone
 I find convenient, comfortable safe especially driving
 I've also found it's handy I'm cooking, writing, shopping-anything requires head cocked one side use hands
 All friends family able hear clearly can't tell difference
 Also earpiece turns right phone rings know you're getting call


it's great product
 

I've 8290 I excited see Jabra worked phone
 They make best headsets there
 However, 8290 picked fact WAS headset connected, WHOLE lot beeping ear piece prevented working
 Just caution fellow 8290 owners
 8800 users enjoy it
 

This one easiest products I seen yet
 It's easy plug talk
 All plug jack begin speaking
 It also comfortable light weight
 Don't miss great gift idea friends cell phones
 &quot;STICK IT IN YOUR EAR
&quot; 

I Jabra EarSet old Nokia 5160 worked BEAUTIFULLY
 I upgraded phone 8260 purchased &quot;compatible&quot; Jabra
 The phone recognized headset connected, I could hear extremely faint sound coming earpiece (yes, volume turned way)
 Went back store try Jabra units luck
 I'm stuck Nokia factory headset sounds fine, nobody hear talk


 

















I bought Jabra earset Nokia 6160 year ago still working great
 Everyone tells voice sounds normal many times people surprised find I cell phone
 If cell phone talk driving, ear set must
 This best one I found
 It comfortable ear thicker/tougher wire seems hold better
 I Nokia brand ear set developed short months, I searching better set begin with
 The package comes various sizes gel ear pieces right left ears
 The problem I I little rough piece connects phone doesn't hang well used to
 But I called manufacturer gave warrenty return code promised new one even though I didn't receipt proof purchased
 Conclusion: It's good buy
 I getting ready buy one wife
 

I tried several headsets ear pieces cellular phones
 Many I returned (large chain, small shop) stores
 I previous experience JABRA EarSets using voice recognitions systems
 I found one Nokia phone one Motorola phone (which also works home phone 2
5mm jack)
 I love them
 People never complain sound quality almost never know I'm wearing it
 It stays firmly ear
 It comfortable long term
 I recommend everyone asks
 

The earphone (hearing) worked well
 I see several reviews talked poor fit
 You work get thing seated correctly
 It IS uncomfortable seat incorrectly use wrong size earpiece
 The microphone also works poorly doesn't seat solidly ear
 I suspect people don't follow directions (insert, twist make sure top part earpiece OUTSIDE ear structure)
 The microphone sensitive picks voice well (if seated correctly) also picks noise well
 I drive mini-van fair amount road noise highway
 I returned mine try Jabra mini-boom model
 Same good fit sound, microphone picks less noise
 I'm happier mini-boom
 A bonus half cost earset model
 

Much comfortable earbud sets
 Transmission clear, without need separate mike
 Biggest problem gel earpieces fall constantly
 

The JABRA EarSet Nokia phone allows talk drive safely
 I couldn't believe worked it's amazing reads vibration jaw
 The sound quality perfect one even knows I using headset
 It's perfect gift idea friends live phone ear
 Don't forget &quot;Practice Safe Cellular
&quot; 

I bought Jabra set use Nokia 5160 phone
 As far I could tell, sound quality acceptable, two things keep mind:1) The plastic ear inserts would fit comfortably ear (one hurt big, next size wouldn't stay ear)
 Further, plastic inserts kept falling speaker
2) There helpful instructions help figure inserts right left ear
 You experiment
 There isn't even instruction insert ear properly
 

Convenient
 Keeps attention road driving
 Great sound quality low noise windy conditions
 Altogether smart purchase
 

I bought Jabra Earset Nokia 5190 month ago
 A friend mine also bought earset I able hear talking (using Nokia 6190)
 The receiver sound quality (talking) slightly worse normal cellphone
 It sounds somewhat distant echoey
 Also, picks background noise, especially car almost seems amplify noise, making hard people hear you
 The speaker (listening) user clear I problems finding earpiece adapter fit me
PROBLEM: The biggest problem I've noted earsets annoying background &quot;buzz&quot;
 I told caused earpiece wire picking reception cellphone antenna
 This buzz heard side person talking hear well, creating quite annoyance
 In fact, background buzz bad times I stopped using Jabra earset entirely unless I driving (It law California)
 The way get rid buzz orient wire certain positions hold wire certain places (very impractical, especially moving around)
 I would return item buy something else except I bought using Amazon discount certificate, I can't
 I've told earsets problem probably advisable get able return try first
 

I use JABRA everyday, really hate it
 I shopping replacement
 THe sound quality fuzzy, incoming outbound
 The earbud uncomfortable, lastly, looks plain ugly I embarrassed strange thing sitting around car
 

This exact item I looking could find stores I shopping
 I read people's reviews said much loved it
 Only one said didn't
 I couldn't wait get it
 Well love quickly died
 I trouble ear pieces
 One seem big next size seem small
 I could hear people great, trouble hearing me
 They said I sounded far away
 I let wife use I listened sure enough didn't sound great
 Major disappointment
 Maybe works people me
 

Unlike hands-free products I've tried, Jabra's EarSet doesnt buzz fits well ear (the medium size
) FYI: picture shown product I sent--I recieved EarSet mic connected earpiece handy little button attached cord allows answer calls hangup without find phone click send/end
 I recall reading dont include instructions tell ear gell fits ear; true
 size ear printed ear gell instructions included arent anywhere near extensive


 idiot proof not
 

CAVEAT EMPTOR - This thing buzzes like bumblebee steroids
 Not even worth 10 bucks, let alone 40 I paid Radio Shed
I would use thing following 2 conditions:1) given free; and2) earset available (i
e
, avoiding brain tumors)
Otherwise, AVOID THIS EARSET AT ALL COSTS


 

I ordered particular headset three sizes earpieces
 My ears smallish I excited think Jabra solved problem
 On contrary
 The smallest earpiece still uncomfortably large ear
Then there's background buzz
 I don't really care spend cell minutes listening friends complain sound quality
 I'll trying something else
 

I could hear fine device, partycannot hear you
 I fiddled little mike (which isattached earpiece) couldn't improve quality
 Ileft voice mail home cell phone check quality -the words unintelligible message
Also, little alligator clip I guess supposed tokeep wire getting tangled broke first time I used it
The earpiece fit fine give problem
 

I found earset excellent value
 The sound clear, comfort/fit far better Nokia earset replaces - around third cost
 The eargells comfortable experience stay speaker ear
 The eargells I received labeled inside, indicating left right ear
 In opinion good product reasonable cost
 

I ordered Monday received Wednesday
 I took home night mother-in-law loved it
 I order another one Thursday morning
 This great asset cell phone user
 It's GREAT
 It comes small/med/large ear pieces left/right ear button middle great call comes press button begin call press end
 I highly recommend this
 

The earpiece problems already noted true
 Definitely worth price
 Worked three months stopped
 Just warranty period
 Not recommended 

Great price, works well
 At first I wasn't sure good would work
 It surpassed expectations
 

This product would great durable
 Over time, started sound like I talking can
 I could barely hear party saying
 Too bad - comfortable worked well three months
 

And comfortable too
 I like much I don't want use phone without Jabra, even I car
 I tried several headsets, Jabra EarSet one I tried sounds loud enough hear I driving
 And, everyone I call road says I sound clear
 The EarGel come easily, especially I toss seat throw bunch junk top it, I keep center console
 

`When I first bought item, worked great, time became harder harder hear
 Several others I spoken similar results sad would great product durable
 

Fiddle I may, party cannot seem hear clearly
 I Jabra earsets, one didn't work
 


 

It work
 The different colored ear pieces hard remove, increadably hard hear person
 Not mention, none ear pieces fit ear properly, fell easily I never able get inside ear
 This poor buy part
 

The earpiece large heavy


it keeps falling ear
 Definitely try buying it
 




Very poor performance
 Original lasted 1 yr 4 mos
 light duty
 Digital standby OK, talking roaming suck battery fast
 Gets warm talking
 That's probably phone's problem, battery though
 

It's good battery


the problem is


small talk tiem

u cannot talk much using battery 8860's battery
on standby works fine, I recommend it

if u phone little expensive good enough 






















This overpriced, under-engineered generally inferior product
 The sound quality good, certainly discreet competing products (people thought I talking wearing it), better options there
You love months prior breaking
 I mine around 4 months prongs destroyed
 The ones phones design
 If put pad earpiece much comfortable won't slip ear much
 It increase safety car
 For thirty dollars Nokia could design something better
The Jabra one I seems little sturdy, costs less replace (if breaks)
 My reccomendation, aren't concerned looks much, go Jabra
 So far I trouble it, besides fact huge
 If won't using Nokia headset much, try luck it, don't say I didn't warn you


 

I've used half dozen market ear pieces last year (most bought large nationwide discount department store), finally decided go Nokia's
This one wins comes volume
 Every 'cheap' aftermarket imitation I've used makes difficult hear party contending highway/road noise (especially Jabra gel hands free)
 With Nokia hands free, I actually turn volume half way one calls loud
Just like hands free piece, treat gently (I've learned hard way)
 I don't think designed handle abuse
 Finally - I've market headsets problems maintaining good contact phone
 Only locked onto phone maintained contact 100% time
 So far I haven't noticed problems Nokia's headset
 The round ear bud might fit everyone, I haven't tried long phone calls (yet), initially comfortable (more Jabra gel's I've used past)
Overall - I initially pleased it
 




 The headset works great one best items Nokia come with
 Potential buyers product know good purchase make
 I've mine year never replace it
 Perhaps David anonymous "wireless customer's" handling equipment causing continuosly break
 I use headset constantly normal work week sporadically weekends
 I use sitting down, walking around outside driving car
 I've never experienced ear soreness headset I felt need move ear bud one ear other
 The reception I receive feedback I speaking positive
 Granted, cloth covering ear bud fall many months continued use rolling around tote
 I located cloth covering put back ear piece
 No problem
 But, even without covering, ear bud pose discomfort whatsoever
 I continue use earbud headset added comfort convenience life
 I recommend product anyone interested
 

Was skeptical clarity first surprised - problems area
 Purchased hands free driving concerns possible radiation built antennas
 Ear bud bit uncomfortable first tends slip alot head movement
 No problems sitting still
 Cord phone adequate length - haven't disconnections
 

I've headset week able get use uncomfortable feels ear
 The first ten minutes use seems ok, longer conversations painful
 Not conversation - ear ache
 Sound quality good ends
 It also friendly adapter comes connecting unconnecting - I always feel like I going damage prongs
 The ear plug could designed better comfort, snug fit
 It really ear-ittating feeling - sorry, I go there
 I quite satisfied product use I find something better
 

This earpiece godsend
 I drive, shop, anything that's non-strenuous keep phone conversation going indefinitely
 The phone setting allows phone/earpiece ring connected
 No reaching phone even connect button earpiece wire
 There point earpiece tire ear insertion handicap reason buy it
 The caution careful snag wire sure main phone unit securely attached belt clothing
 

This great thing always phone
 I use car, bus, walking around town
 Sometimes people wonder I talking them
 The wires sometimes get way
 

It's convient head-set works well, WHEN works
 I agree posts design robust
 It falls apart within month use
 I've replace mine several times now
 The wire connects microphone poorly designed put enough strain it, much, start static, noice, complete cut-off sound issues
 If choose buy product, buy several back affort buy aftermarket products cheaper
 

I bought three first came two associates
 Within 2 weeks, mine stopped working shortly thereafter two
 I since replaced 6 associates replaced twice gave up
 The little prongs headset insert phone keep breaking
 For limited time product functioning I loved it
 True foam earpiece fell immediately, even without it, I found comfortable
 I wish darn thing would work days
 I since given replacing I wish would improve design convenient
 One last thing, small people familiar headsets going look like you've gone nuts


talking actually phone used
 

This set high-quality sound, always comes clearly earpiece
 Get hands-free set, use hands drive
 

This handsfree set compatible NOkia 6100 phone
 The jack small phone
 

Does cut ambient noise, makes voice smaller phone
 I found clumsy try find earpiece manage wire
 I think would better one boom-type microphones gets closer mouth
 

I've already 2 Nokia headsets broken another one
 The design connection phone isn't durable
 It looks like I'm stuck I buy different kind phone
 

I doubtful gizmo I first saw it
 An in-the-ear phone mike dangling far away mouth? Bu AT&amp;T phone center salesman wearing one, seemed like it
 So I bought one
And son gun- DOES work
 I've used driving, sitting front computer paddling kayak, phone safely tucked waterproof bag- I never complaint audio quality caller end
It's unbreakable
 There's mike boom headband, large plastic parts
 Just earplug, mike, clip, wire connecting them
 Simple, elegant functional
 

Earphone sets like sell Taiwan $7
 Why would anyone pay $29
95 one? 

Iam odering The Product From Abu Dhabi U
A
EMy Telephone 009712-6415522 

I've earbud several months now
 The sound quality excellent - better handset
 However, foam cover earpiece fell first day, design doesn't mechanism hold place ear
 Because this, keeps falling ear I'm driving, makes even distracting holding handset
 

Yes, I one &quot;people&quot; love headset, also hate it
 I Nokia phone headset
 Like many others, job short conversations
 But, longer conversations ear starts ache I find taking ear
Is better though? Until I find better product good sound quality has, I keep using product
 

Recomend Product


but earpiece quite uncomfortable period time
 Makes chating go easier
 Only need keypad dial number
 Convenient button wire connects earpiece phone allows answer calls without fumbeling find button keypad driving
 Would reccomend receive alot calls go
 

While I really appreciate accessory freedom movement allows (no crick neck trying precariously clench phone ear shoulder), ear bud uncomfortable
 I can't hold coversation longer minutes without ear beginning ache
 I thought first I must ears anomoly nature, sharing peeve friends, I've found quite folks gripe product
 

I pretty cynical voice quality possible via microphone sits fair distance away mouth
 But I proven wrong
 This thing works great
 Not I hear person end phone great clarity, hear me
 Even I'm car window open, completely shields background noise
 I've expensive installed car kits case
Also, I find earpiece quite comfortable secure
My gripe earbuds general (no, I'm ragging Nokia) encourage people look like dorks, walking around town talking air
 Get clue, people
 

Within past 5 months cell phone, I replace hands-free earbud average one every week
 The main reason: POOR ENGINEERING &amp;/or DESIGN
 Every time would sit phone belt clip, point contact always base phone right headset attached, thus causing fine wires coming attachment break
 Also, two plastic tabs attach headset cell phone always breaking ruining use headset
 These two major set backs &quot;Design
&quot; Just briefly note comfort earpiece
 After couple uses, loose padding earbud
 After hour earpiece placed properly ear becomes uncomfortable thus switch ears causing mic one's mouth making difficult party hear
 My solution: Redesign earpiece shape one's inner ear
 The attachment needs either ninety degree angle (so wires come side bottom) built mount side cell phone
 After many e-mails Nokia calls still accept idea ideed poor design
 

While device's output sound quality benefits fact sits literally millimeters eardrum, don't believe hype microphone, dangles far mouth function adequately
 For maximal mike sound quality, you'll hold mike near mouth
 Not great look traffic
Did I mention flimsy construction? Expect replace device every 3-4 months
 If connector doesn't fall apart, earbud disintegrates
 That said, genuine Nokia quality way better rendered tinny knockoffs, audio quality also far superior produced marginally sophisticated devices hook ear place shoddy mini-boom mouth
I'm still waiting hear gizmos really cut celphone radiation causes eye brain disorders
 BTW, I'm buy third one these
 

The way headset connects nokia phone poorly designed
 The connector flimsy, breaks easily
 I purchase 3 new headsets one year
 The Motorola Startac much better design headsets
 

After year half, I second earbud
 This proved indispensable accessory me
 My real complaint ringer tone sound ear
 If phone clipped belt noisy environment hockey game, I cannot hear ring
 All I get faint click earpiece, could also caused low-battery notification
 In car, however, great
 I use Nokia car holster I find combination quite convenient
 The plug prone damage easily, current one continues work adequately despite slight amount damage
 I could also wish boost sound level little, people I talking trouble hearing me
 It took little get used microphone working fine despite well away mouth
 

I time getting used earpiece help use phone safely car
 But jack used connect phone flimsy
 The caveat mentioned description came true - prongs side jack snapped one day
 Now I can't plug phone
 I wish someone warned me
 I would careful
 



Damn thing won't stay ear
 Makes difficult carry conversation keeps falling ear
 Maybe I put magnet tape head might better
 A complete waste money
 

I recently upggraded 6120 3360
 The best thing increase ringer volume
 Anyways I got ear bud thing it
 I could barely understand ppl saying
 It horrible
 It sounded can
 

doesn't work kyocera
as rat thing above, yeah, rat I guess I'd using headset alot, too
 

I ordered two headsets one I got phone stopped working
 Mind you, I didn't treat well even stepping ear piece twice (and keeping held together rubber band) thing still working
 It repeated abuse finally fell apart
 I figure two I'll cut transport fro, much
 This first time ordering Amazon I'm hoping I won't disappointed
 Oh, response review dated 2-27-03 (cell phones brain cancer mice), two studies mentioned corroborated future studies conducted matter
 See FDA's reports (www
fda
gov/cellphones) extensive international research compiled report Medical College Wisconsin (www
mcw
edu)
 

This perfect earpiece 8260, 3360, 8265
 It sounds fine, mic works well, answer/hangup button inline cord
 A little expensive yes, it's great driving earbud isn't big, unlike Nokia models
 

I really like convenience (very light folds easily) quality earbud
 The drawback sometimes makes annoying buzzing sound
 This mitigated twisting plug around (go figure) moving phone around -- kind like trying pick radio station
 It's inconvenient sounds, it's something aware of
 The volume quality sound (when there's buzzing) really impressive, microphone picks voice well even I'm driving twisting head around keep eye traffic
 

This useful product
 The earpiece sound clear earpiece stays snugg ear
 For safety driving I would highly recommend it
 

I would agree reviewers saying probably best hands-free set phone market
 I'm buying third one
 That said, I'm buying third one less three years-- yes, durable headset
 Because cell phones recently shown cause brain cell death rats two hours (GSM) use (Leif Salford, Lund University Hospital, Sweden published Environmental Health Perspectives), I use headset time
 I careful headset cord, even you're careful expect high burn rate frequent usage
The microphone sensitive wind mid- high-pitched noises, cell phone without attachment
 So beware you're planning using outside
With drawbacks, still seems best product market
 

(This review based use Nokia 8260)About best thing I say hands-free set one tell I'm using (or least I switch it, I've never gotten comment person end I suddenly sound different)
 Reception ear bud equally clear (you'll probably want turn volume phone using it)
I don't much say except I'm satisfied product
 I use cell phone primary phone, long conversations either walking sitting it's great relief
 

Headset adapter doesn't fit phone connection
Bought two still don't headset cell phone
 

My wife I recently upgraded phones Nokia 6555
 As usual headsets old Nokia's wouldn't operate new ones
 After researching prices exact (supposedly) Nokia earbub headsets, settled two sets
 Shipment FAST, however neither worked either phones
 I think paid $2
95 each, shipping around $ 17
00
 I did'nt even bother return ( I have), I figured nearly got money's worth
 Next time I go higher priced set
 

I finally found ear piece 2 year old Nokia phone
 However, ear insertion doesn't stay ear constantly falls out
 So, I'm using hand keep ear piece ear
 Also, hearing volume effective
 Annoying, can't anything it
However, I've discovered find stuff Amazon that's good thing
 

Excellent product - I've ordered three case one stops working
 The sound clear they're convenient use
 The company gave excellent service shipping
 

This headset works great although microphone hangs cord, picks voice great
 Try you'll find always plugging driving
 

As useful device, I like convenience, fact carry pocket
Advantages:1
 It's truly hands free answer calls hang without find cell phone it's attached to
2
 Not quite breakable similar products I've used, still come pieces within 2-3 months matter do
The three biggest drawbacks are:1
 (And one worst) If there's background noise, you're outdoors there's even slightest puff wind, people difficult time hearing you, you'll get lot annoyed requests talk without (to put mildly)2
 It hurt ear while, especially wear glasses kind, added pressure
3
 It slips ear easily4
 Despite advantage #2, above, eventually break you're careful it
 I need keep attached I'm rushing around, sometimes I can't take time put away carefully I should, shove pocket untangle something
 As result, life expectancy usually two months people use like I do
 

This earbud came 8290 3390
 I thought I lost it, I bought Jabra earset (it free rebate all

)
 So I found one went - It pocket I washed it
 I took out, let dry works perfectly
 At first mic didn't work I left hours ok
That's I call durable
 You rely last long time
 I'm still using mine even I washed it
 Don't know it's worth 24
99 though
 That sounds bit expensive, type quality it's well worth it
The Jabra way, collecting dust
 The ear gels really uncomfortable falls ear
 The on/off button hard press, press hard hang use voice dialing
 I'm glad came free rebates - Otherwise I would've $10 somethign I would never use
 The Nokia brand earbud beats Jabra hands down
 

I bought earbud upgrade earbud came AT&amp;T,Nokia 8260
 I also bought Jabra earbud - compare both
 This earbud works quite well
 Compared Jabra sound quality going well coming earbud little less clear
 However, major advantage earbud doesn't pick much annoying wind noise rustling clothes noise
 This earbud sensitive enough but, sensitive obnoxious
 I kept earbud - It works well enough comfortable enough
 The though comes assortment ear &quot;gels&quot;,is complicated surprisingly uncomfortable good
 

I got headset part package 8260 I'm definitely happy
It's necessary product driving especially easy use hang-up boutton mic
It's light comfortable
The earphone good sound output, mic picks sound well




 

It must saved couple times driving trying talk phone answer call
Also, law it's illegal drive talking phone saves dumb tickets
Being 29
99, it's bit expensive, mic, earbud, mini plug
 You careful stretch wire, break fragile thin cables inside rubber jacket, less streatchy
 

After I lost Nokia Earbud Headset Nokia 8890, I purchased Jabra EarBoom tried days returning it
 The Nokia Earbud Headset lot better


in fact it's awesome
 I don't problems it
 Compared Jabra, much better
 

This single best accessory I found 8290
 I use phone day long, tried many brands styles ear pieces
 The quality comfort earpiece beats others hands down
 

The earbud came 3360
 I never used earbud skeptical -- I couldn't imagine staying ear
 But does, easily, I use time
 It doesn't fall walking, one end ever complained microphone quality
 I love it
 

This headset works great Nokia 2610
 It plugs easily good voice quality
 For me, I talking cell phone without headset
 The price great I got one husband's phone too
 




























The horizontal orientation good alternative vertical
 This prevents catching chairs like
 Other Nokia phones, 8290, 8260, etc


 fit
 However, purchase product Nokia's website 14
99(US$) so, I'm sure price marked high here
 

I'd like add case &quot;perfect&quot; fit Nokia 8260
 It's matter phone fitting another phone's case, 8260's charging port lines exactly hole case
 The clip also secure nice
 Love it
 

I using case almost year
 The product fan-tastic
 The clip extremely sturdy I never fall off
 The flip-cover fastens magnetic snap usually closes easily
 The real benefit case sideways-orientation
 I even know I wearing case, never way
 Retreival phone easy (you take phone case use, unless using headset)
 Use headset easy case
 (I use Nokia earbud now, ordered Jabra boom amazon)
 I would easily order again, would easily pay it
 












This phone case great protecting phone 


 never plann talking it
 Personally I found leather flap covers face phone annoyance
It makes difficult to:1) Answer ringing phone - open properly locate call answer button2) Talk phone - You open dial either hold flap open talk (it rubs face) close open ensure properly hung up
Unlike brands face flap opens horizontally, either rub neck trying talk phone open block peripheral vision slightly
For reasons I prefer either cell phone case clear front front cover opens vertically removed entirely
The belt clip case satisfactory
Lastly, I found make case I received hole bottom allows access charging jack headphone socket obstructed, requiring insert either angle, possibly damaging phone
 

I've owned case year &amp; never &quot;slip off&quot; belt
 I've even clipped camera case belt &amp; never lost despite roller coasters turn upside down
 I admit it's little bit hassle answer since it's covered &amp; fits snugly belt
 I personally use phone &quot;emergency situations&quot; I don't get many phone calls
 I whole heartly recommend case don't mind it's easily accessible remain snug belt
 

I bought case last year
 I six weeks zipper began rip
 When cut opening charger bottom, cut fabric zipper
 This jeapardizes integrity zipper
 As slip tight cover zip up, pulls fabric tape
 Because tape cut, nothing keep fraying unraveling - time inevitable
 When I contacted Nokia product, would nothing - covered poor workmanship
 

This case tight-fitting awkward use
 

This &quot;the doctor&quot; ordered
 The case it's supposed do; protect face provide belt clip
 Perfect needs
 

I thought phone case good idea
 *At first*
 The leather's thick enough protective (I've dropped it) clip best I've seen
 But phone emergencies
 And even so, it's really become pain
The front flap closes velcro face & folded (& secured) back talk, even using hands-free
 I don't think it's worth even [price]
 

I found carrying case good deal
 At first kind tight getting fit phone I able fit phone
 It also works good shock absorber drop phone
 I would recommend anyone everyone
 

I bought case time I purchased phone simply purpose protecting phone
 After phone 2 months phone still looks brand-new scratches display all
 Not that, many friends actually complimented really &quot;nice&quot; friends come say case, must really better ones
 Anyway aside compliments, exceeded expectations keeping phone mint condition
 

I &quot;had&quot; Nakia phone case, I found hard way slip belt
 I lost phone riding motorcycle, never find it
 I plan buying another Nokia phone look case can't slip easily sure I take I ride
 Also, I phone case slip car also
 

We extreme difficuty trying place case phone
 A portion cover ripped
 Maybe mine defective
 I would suggest stretching cover placing
 

I remember, people used slip bulky cell phones equally bulky case-holder wear belts
I several years early 2000's using Nokia 5100 Carrying Case
 The case good quality held pretty well couple years
Of course made bulky cell phone even bulkier; hey, least gave chance wear belt
 Also, wasn't much hassle press buttons either
 Not bad all
 

I didn't like case first
 It looked like would pain


I wrong
I work agriculture, harsh conditions inside out, climbing vehicles day, etc
 This case PERFOMED BEAUTIFULLY
 I used replace window Nokia 5165 every 2 months, I haven't replaced since purchasing case


Much less scratching VERY good clip
 




Very nice looking, sturdy


 I glad I got it
 

I bought husband
 He loved it, except flap front
 It inconvenient always open (the velcro held tight), cut flap off
 The belt holder works great
 

I bought case expectation clipping belt bag, making phone accessable
 It fit I wanted it's hard get quickly
 I missed several calls I can't get unhooked quick enough (but could me
) I'm passing family member liked it
The velcro-secured cover also gets caught hair gets way I hurry
 It doesn't prevent accidentally pushing buttons phone, may fault
 I won't buy another I probably buy one husband, I don't find one I like better
 

I ordered case fit 6160 Nokia phone
 Since Nokia product, I expected quality got that; stitching straight, case fits like glove
 As matter fact, case actually snug (probably allow leather stretch [over time] still properly fit phone), I found bit struggle unzip zip phone
 If plan plug wall charger phone, you'll set since opening adapter plugged without unzipping case
The belt clip nice
 It's leather-covered, doesn't protrude much beyond case, securely fastens phone belt
 If don't need wrist strap, good case protect cell phone investment
 

A carrying case serve two functions: making phone easier carry (via clip whatever attaching device may have), &amp; protecting phone dirt &amp; damage
 This carrying case make phone easier carry via belt clip, protect phone way
 The face open, dirt dust reach screen &amp; keypad
 The case made leather thin affords protection accidental knocks drops
 A little padding would gone long way make better case, &amp; would front panel opens &amp; closes via snap zip
 Also, case fits way snugly, &amp; it's real struggle trying get phone &amp; it
 I'm looking better made case offers protection phone
 Don't waste money case
 







I Nokia 282 phone case perfect fit
 The leather nice soft too
 What else could want case
 

































































I bought phone fifteen months ago initially pleased
 Lots features, really cool sounding stereo sound stereo speakers
 But



 I use cell phone average 1500 minutes month
 The slide hold up
 The phone sections separated one side, I got sim card failure message phone screen button would turn phone off
 Removed battery dead desk, turn battery reinstalled
 $300 fifteen months little pricey
 









































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The case beautifully made, fits like glove, functions perfectly
Glad see item still available
 And, 6% original price, I bought 3
 It one best deals vendor Amazon I made purchases from
Thank you


 













































































When I received "new" battery, unsealed plastic bag
 I concerned actually used rather new
 However, worked fine far
 It appears work well identical model battery came electronic device
 

Compare original BP-5L battery I have, build quality battery obviouslylower many aspects
 I cannot say sure it's counterfeit, manydifferences original battery:- The circles around "+" "-" thinner
- The font "NOKIA" thinner
- The paint words symbols much less clear
- The seam plastics well-glued
- In English reads "MADE IN HUNGARY", French reads "MADE IN CHINA" 





















































































I bought headset Nokia 6102i
 It cheap($10) I decided give try
 I hard time fitting connector phone, I manage get in
 The first time I tried it, I couldn't hear anything headset
 The second time, I made sure press headset connector phone fairly hard, started working
 I found touching connector disconnect phoneThe sound quality ok
 I've tried another headset using Nokia pop-port 2
5mm universal adapter, headset sounds much better
Also, using pop-port 2
5mm universal adapter, 6102i phone recognizes headset displays headset icon middle phone
 The 2
5mm adapter also stays connected phone much better headset
 I think head cheap materials construction
 (How else could sell $10)I decided return headset use 2
5mm adapter instead
Summary:Pros:1) Cheap(Only $10)Cons:1) Poor ok sound quality2) The headset doesn't stay connected phone well
 



































I bought someone else couldn't use I took fits phone right

I rated Nokia 5 Stars SECOND phone, phone phone recomended
 I Nokia 9500 I use everyday I switch 7280 I going night people would see it
 Dialing number tedious job Navi-Spinner getting contacts list also frustrating
 The easiest way dialing using voice commands
Also buying please make sure DONT get firmware v03
22, lot bugs crashes time, make sure get higher firmware verison
 

Definite 'attention getter
' I would highly recommend getting Motorola Bluetooth HS850 headset spending time attaching voice tags contacts numbers
 This makes phone much functional work/frequent dialing
 Standard best class Nokia menus, great computer interface sending tones/images back forth
But beware dialing lot IVR-type numbers enter additional numbers in-call
 That difficult part using phone
I love it
 

This phone cool
 If looking something use alot, I would pick something else
 I mainly got looks
 It super cool toy
 Nothing else like it
 

I going write options phone - read official Nokia web site, but


This phone unusual, beautiful, stylish good reception, works bluetooth
 The minus I point dial lot phone numbers - that's phone you
 It rotator dial rotate every number
 Though program numbers memory use - that's another thing: use bluetooth infrared GPRS transfer numbers current phone, convenient fast
I phone since released Europe I still favorite, I going use long works Nokia's phones work looooong time
 


I've actually never written negative response before, I've bought hundreds products Amazon
 The first earpiece broke within day, second one broke within week so
 There doesn't seem headset made made well, one worst I've had
 

Not much say, worked box cheap
 I longer phone I purchased for, misplaced cable
 I speak longevity cable
 

WOW
 I couldn't find cable anywhere
 My cell phone older one available
 In desperation I searched Amazon
com
 Thank thank thank you
 There was, displayed info I needed select correct one
 And I could believe price
 It fantastic
 

Works fine less 1/10 Nokia price
 Wish little instruction, software steps logical enough 

This data cable works perfectly
 The AT&T store tried sell $50
00 cable charged too
 I didn't need want that
 I wanted transfer pics, data, music, etc
 phone PC
 It great buy exactly I want do
 

OEM Original Nokia CA-53 Connectivity USB Data Cable 6255i, 6256i, 6235i, 6236i, 6230, 3155i, 9300, 9300i, 6165i, E61, 6126, 6131, 6133, 6136, N75, 6085, 6086The product performed promised
 The price 25% I would pay retail store included shipping
 Delivery vendor fast
 Received within 5 days order date via standard UPS shipping
 

Product little late

price 50% less AT&T store
 Bottom line good service, great price

I received case less week ago
 Because phone new, I've using lot, setting different features
 Today, case seemed getting sticky, I discovered coating disintegrating/melting scraping off, leaving matt, tacky state
 The paint also already begun chip I haven't treated badly all
I also Jet Black FlexSkin Case I also wouldn't recommend - sliding element coming unglued case arrived unless know phone button arrangement really well, can't sure you're pressing right buttons can't see black skin
 Perhaps Frosted Clear version would better least
I love phone I can't seem find case protect keep easily useable
 I've yet try Fosmon Crystal Clear hard case - perhaps that'll next
 

























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































This phone inital problems screen going certain frequency
 After repairs became better
Fairly resistent abuse i
e
 dropping
 The battery life reasonable usually talk well hour half
 Encountered software problems e
g
 would automatically go headset mode able go back normal
 And also way around
 Reeption weak side
pressure face plate cause variety screen problems unusual crashes
Otherwise quite reliable
 

I've using Nokia phones exclusively since 1998 so, can't say enough usability solid interface design
 Though model bit fragile, compact functionality value unbeatable
Dos:- get wired earbud (Nokia, aftermarket), 2, 3, keep home, bag, car
- get extra chargers
- Get case protects phone allows wired earbud connect
Don'ts:- Don't let battery run way down, shorten lifetime
- Don't throw phone around
 Used wired earbud voice dial talk phone stays safe purse pocket
- Don't hesitate get spare covers, they're cheap easy swap out
If you're new Nokia, give time learn way around menus
 Once do, you'll able pick almost Nokia use it
 I promise
 

Everything fine

I needed replacement charger Nokia 6205 phone
 I bought charger I want spend $20-40 person get charger I believe store would charger phone long discontinued

 The buttons good, large menu easy use
 The phone compact sound great
 No issues
 I put sim card went
 

I've phone year (38 hours dialed, 80 hours received)
It's tough simple phone
It fell water (I opened dried it) several times "thrown" floor mistake it's still working fine
The battery lasts several day

I bought phone loyal Motorola customer years
 After starting Nokia phone, I wanted clamshell type phone, began using Motorola
 I recently purchased Nokia performance I rely Nokia phones
 I dissappointed
 I happy phone
 I purchased 'unlocked' happy performance
 I Cingular customer, want sign new contract get new phone
 Great buy
 

I want phone that, phone
 An offers features might need one
 Great SMS texting, good battery life reception
You never go wrong Nokia
 

I say pretty good phone

 Awesome battery life cool features
 It's high tech far, you're looking decent phone it
 I love much I'm thinking buying third one
 It's one phones depend on
 

good cheap simple handle buth motorola simple
 jacob puister costa rica 

Other reviewers complained phones T-Mobile, selling point me, since that's provider
 However, phone, although unlocked, "Rogers" phone
 That means many network features built other, identical, T-Mobile phone unavailable
 This means T-Zones, automatic time set, etc
 If could selected provider (there many T-Mobile phones), would nice, rather perpetual "roamer
" Otherwise, phone performs well


 

NOKIA 6103 WAS SHIPPED VERY FAST AN IT WORKES GREATVERY HAPPY THANK YOURICH KAZAKA 

This best cellphone I've owned
 Simple, Effective & Rugged


 like me
 The FM reception unsurpassed superior proper radio I've tried, even wretched airport flight path I deliver mail
 Pristine "Live Met" Saturdays, daily Democracy Now
 NPR day long help keep sane enough execute mundane duties tear & smile
 Oh, yeah


 PHONE calls sound great well
Virtually indestructible, repeatedly dropped 10 thumbs cement pavements asphalt alike
Unfortunately, I've come two (so far) ways ruin it:(1) Drop mug beer
(2) Forget it's pants, throw wash AND heat-dry it
Irregardless human stupidity, proven great phone
 I'm going buy another one right now
 Wish luck


? 

I've used phone 136 hours since purchase via T-mobile last December 2008
 Good reception, good feel keyboard, loud/useful speaker-phone (can set desk parties hear OK) so-so camera
 If need older reliable phone, one work you
 I bought second ebay backup case I lost one
 Cheap insurance
 

rubberized coating phone started peeling next day
 I stuck nokia years love menus maneuver
 This phone doesn't work all


as far tell way delete one text message time
 put SIM card doesn't automatically add name number first week moving SIM memory phone also wasn't easy last nokia
 lastly headset comes awkward least
 easy deal driving roll windows strain hear speaker phone
 it's sturdy good sound signal I won't ordering second phone replace one dies 

Perfect replacement broken Nokia 6102i
 The annoyance "Rogers" logo screen phone itself
 We don't Rogers US
 But doesn't love Canadians?
 

From one end spectrum other, Nokias best
 I one well e90 Communicator
 You can't go wrong Nokias
 The 6103 doesn't wifi, really simple phone, it's great
 Unfortunately though, I bought 6103 Dr Cell Phone isn't unlocked claim
 

This phone lock first get it
 Then try get help impossible
 I even use phone
 Would never buy anything else amazon 

Unlocked YES
 Unbranded NO
 The pictures show unbranded phone branded "T Mobile" 

The phone work well
 No paper work address came return satisfied
 I emailed sent address I felt insecure sending away even receipt I could copy
 When open phone blank screen 50% time
 Can't used screen finally reappears
 (Can long time
) 

I ordered phone looking forward enjoying great disappointment phone technical defect day received it
 The ear piece voume control faulty causing experience difficulty hearing
 I tried adjusting volume controls several times didnt work ended returning product
 I love nokia phone phone hell
 





































































































































































I loved cord storage compact travel charger Nokia phone, charger stopped working less three months
 My two original Nokia chargers also failed less year
 Meanwhile, (non-Nokia) chargers I've bought last five years still working fine
 The two Nokia 6015i phones I've owned (the first one died) also quality control problems I've ever cellular phone, I'm avoiding Nokia products now
 






































































































I product remote cabin TV phone line
 It gives peace mind I away months time check property time
 It works charm, sending picture every time motion detected
 You even call listen sure activated it
 The temperature monitor useful keep eye freezing etc
 Allot bang buck well made
Just make sure carrier SIM card purchase good signal cheep could add up
 There doubt set complicated due activating SIM card etc
 My carrier T-Mobile I use pay go text option
 I get cheep phone activate card using phone transferred SIM device
 Just follow instructions meticulously fine
 Images aren't great enough ID visitors
 

I use IP cameras keep eye various locations problematic bunch - different interfaces functionality, poor support never quite promised
 And die year so
 On hand, I've Nokias (and predecessor model) forever, soldier on
 Of course, it's completely different approach, using GSM data network connectivity
 Which good bad, since (good) don't need internet access location (bad) need GSM cellular phone service
 As additional fly ointment, neither AT&T; T-Mobile US (the GSM providers) offer simple cheap PayAsYouGo data plan (that I know of) keeping camera "alive" US expensive
 I've looked 3rd-party providers seem use special access codes make jump hoops connect
This camera well-thought-out device
 The (PC only) setup application works well intuitively
 You control camera (once set up) remotely sending text messages
 Pretty slick
 The image quality stellar, (on later model) it's good typical VGA IP camera
 I know Nokia distracted trying stay business days, product example good things used do
 

This camera excellent product, I use monitor property I send pictures time I want, something happen send alert, I sure happen real time incredible price
 programming text that's it, start send text 

This CAM badAnd reason adopting system Port com1And I run 














































This business phone all
 I keep three chargers; one car, one office one home
 I end happy battery last full day
However, negatives phone
 It large keys, big screen, supports important applications, etc
 If nokia launches new high capacity battery phone, I first person buy it
 








I don't want talk AT&T; Service may applicable everybody least around place
Ahh

its sweet hear famous Nokia tune back year long gap

 Nokia always favorite Cell phones reliable especially strong long battery power
 N75 first Flip-flap phone I'm using I'm love already
 I like large screen tiny preview music player feature top flap
 Its holding cell phone size really handful me
 When I hold I feel good grip hence secured
 And cover surface pattern gives sense holiding delicate stuff feel soft always good
 Though screen movement bit slow

but features built little piece really good
 Bluetooth connection simple sober



 Good possible needed controls like volume, Camera Music player surface phone
 And many direct controls one-click away keypad
 Haven't explored much short-cut keys (bear me

for computer freak) /controls



 All-in-all


this great phone Hats-off NOKIA



 











































This cable supported cellphone, I read someplace original Nokia DKU5 (already discontinued) cable E65, I read more, generic, advise sure cable works cellphone


 

It plain work
 Nothing else say
 I wasted money this
 

hi every one want buy amazon,every thing great,the product shipping time add pice
i go buy sites ever amazonthanx 






















































































I like n75
 It nice screen, good features, cool apps
 run it
However, it's good mobile games
 The directional button close music button quits game press it
 Also s60 v3 wont run old n-gage games like I thought would
The camera good stills
 There long delay hear shutter picture taken
 Making action shots impossible "posed for" pictures always seem subject smiles
 Video, hand, pretty impressive
Battery life best phone either
 But bad reviews lead beleive
Music player functions good
 Nokia port instead standard jack really sucks though
 It pain plug things thing
 Nokia behind times area
Overall I would recommend n75 anyone wants s60 v3 phone music capabilities doesn't mind nokia port
 

























































































































































































































































































































I bought ClearPro headset similar Plantronics headset (that cost more) time
 Tried side side, surprise, sound quality earpiec voice quality microphone appreciably better inexpensive headset Plantronics one
However, I got try once: When I disconnected ClearPro first test use, one two plastic prongs pop-port connector broke off
 I suppose partially blame Nokia proprietary somewhat retarded connector style
 But comparison, Plantronics version connector much solid
In general, construction over-the-ear, mic boom, etc
, ClearPro somewhat- greatly-flimsier headset
 

The headset worked fine, pins connector snapped two months, rendering unusable
 





















































One reviewer said charger didn't work, mine worked fine even travels 4 plane flights week, getting bumped around laptop bag
 It made Nokia, third party manufacturer
 

It's slim size allows charge phone without taking 2 outlets
 

Item better described
 Quick charge old model Nokia cell phone
 This item hard find elsewere
 

Did work, sent back refund
 Would NOT buy vendor again
 










While cute nice looking case, fit Nokia Lumia 900 advertised


 It took 10 minutes shove Lumia there, point impossible get out
 Do get phone
 For another smaller phone (it fits boyfriend's iPhone quite nicely) seems like nice case
 




This idea whose time come
 USB ubiquitous, mobile warriors enough power bricks carry around, eliminating couple favor portable solution worth weight gold
Problem I received item, plug small Nokia 3650's AC input
 I think plug bundled kit smaller/older Nokias whose AC input smaller
But fear not
 Keyspan replace you, send right plug
 You emailing support team product's website ziplinq
com
 They replaced quickly, questions asked
Now works like champ
 Too bad didn't bundle right connectors first place though
 






















































































































































I took one look faceplate I wanted imediately
 The colors blend together well eye catching
 This definately faceplate I would love have
 

Whenever I travel (and car) I find much practical taking conventional charger
 It lightweight saved many times battery goes middle conversation (e
g
 getting directions)
 I noticed colored car chargers I would consider easy overlook black cord leaving rental car (especially night)
 But makes charger especially valuable rapid charge feature; pay bit freedom affords -- careful leave behind
 

Express yourself
 This product allows that
 Whether want coordinate favorite shirt want stand hangs belt, easier way use Xpress-on faceplate covers
 The installation easy, five year old son able perform task problems
 The faceplate deter functionality phone original Nokia accessory
 Another advantage option mixing matching fronts backs different looks
 With simple change, able change look personlity phone, also use head turner attention grabber
 The positive feedback I received made absolutely fun worthwhile
 

Hi

,Um

 I'd like ta know much min
 k

 Thanks

 

Theres really reason purchase rapid charger,its slightly smaller one comes phone, charges slightly faster, reason bought lost previous charger, save money buy something else 

Worked fine first 9 months, broke down
 Had similar experience Nokia headset - built last
 

Comes two parts: wire base plug
 It takes 30 seconds less attach two pieces you're ready charge
 My Nokia 8260 fully charged little two hours
 I keep one I got Nokia 8260 home second one stays office
 You won't disappointed
 

I love cover
 It's flat white - almost metallic finish
 The price right, changing old one easy white, I find quickly purse
 I definitely pleased purchase
 

bought cuz looks like storm troopers star wars


 

really cool color got 3390 goes really good cover got [amazon
com] also











the best ever





 




I like charge cell phone nightstand every night
 However, little wire kept falling crevice bed


very annoying
 This handy little stand allows simply dock phone place
 Your charger cable goes back stand, phone sits snugly top
No searching cable, fumbling little hole bottom phone
 Our cordless phones always drop-in-dock charging--it's time wireless phones did, too
I two minor issues product
 First, spare battery port
 It seems fewer fewer people second battery, probably big deal
 Secondly, work sort leather, vinyl, neoprene case
 Because stand designed fit precisely phone, external add-on cases prevent phone seating cradle
 Custom Express-on covers, however, seem fit fine--this goes Nokia Express-On shells, well generic third-party skins
 Think twice getting product protective case hard take phone
 I Body Glove Prism case ( fine way show phone ), it's difficult take phone charging
 However, minor inconvenience earns otherwise fine product four star rating instead five
Bottom line--unless you're love leather case never want take phone it, make wireless phone convenient charge cordless phone
 Buy desktop charging stand today
 

I hurry I ordered this
 Somehow, I thought would handy desktop *alternative* plug-in adapters I've using, instead, it's *supplement*
You still need adapter (not included) plugged &quot;charging&quot; stand, frankly, slightest wobble unit move papers around jiggle table could stop recharging process even though it's still sitting giving false impression charged
 Then, grab suddenly find it's low power, might like device all
However, I give 3 stars DOES function beautifully -- within context it's meant -- without hitch
 

THE NOKIA 3390 CHARGING STAND IS LIGHT WEIGHT &amp; EASY TO CARRY AROUND IN YOUR POCKETBOOK
 IT ALSO LOOKS NICE ON MY DESK (SMILE) 

I bought Nokia Desktop Charging Stand -- spite negative review
 -- I liked much I got one husband
 Granted, don't leather cases phone -- charging stand makes charging (and finding
) 3360's much, much easier
 Bottom line? No, don't *need* buy -- want create &quot;home&quot; phone re-charging batteries, way go
 

This cute faceplate
 The color quite reminiscent &quot;Cubic Scoops&quot; ice cream (does anyone remember that? Orange sherbet vanilla ice cream
)
 This style great summer months tropical vacations, pick-me-up dreary winter months
 It's particularly versatile average wardrobe (especially males
), it's nice funky faceplate
 

I received yesterday, I charged full capacity then
 It hasn't gone yet, I've using lot today
 My original battery would've halfway now
 So, works really well
 I highly recommend it
 

I useing battery mounth I think brand new one
It came original box I opened I fund dirt it
The battery life longer normal one
 I think extended
 worth it


 

The product appears working quite well
 I satisfied product
 

I purchased 3 batteries 2 3 don't work
 I didn't even try 3rd battery
 It appears hold charge day, actually try make answer call shuts claiming battery low
 I recharge 5 mins, indicate fully charged again, act way
 They probably rejects I wouldn't ask replacements probably buy Eforcity again
 No confidence
 

Exceptional savings service 75% savings, including postage
 Local merchants would "special order"
 

Nokia BLC-2 Standard Batterylow price best buy check shipping charges make sure get better shipping charge ordering one(if like phone,or friend model, order quantity aftermarket replacements cost way original oems gone
 

This advertised "Brand new OEM Nokia battery BLC-2"I don't believe new batteries
 The first one I received half life original two year old battery
 The RMA replacement I received gives low battery warning first call
 It dies second
Neither battery arrived original packaging
I impressed made claim Amazon
com A-to-z Guarantee
I would rate item zero, I forced give one order post review
 

Received battery without problems
 The battery charge original battery still used
 I contacted vendor resolution yet due cost believe I will
 Rather wasting time phone still works original battery last long should, I replacing phone fails completely
 

I received batteries fast without hassles
 The complaint I new batteries lose charge much quicker original factory batteries
 

This first time I used service woun't last
 I really hard time finding I looking I dialed site was
 I also impressed price, 30% less expensive everything else I could find
 It arrived two days exactly I wanted, Thanks Amazon
 com
Thanks Don 

I talk phone 5 hours charging
 Just like I used phone NEW
 The delivery fast 2 

I purchased 2 batteries set failing OEM batteries
 The battery half life quite short seem accept charge,this repeated 2 separate phones chargers
 They duds new stock I suspect
 Watch out
 

It's fairly simple: CCMAccessories clearly shipping used batteries, contrary assertion product page new
 I got mine today life terrible plenty cosmetic blemishes showing obviously I bargained for
 I recommend purchasing them, I'm lodging complaint w/ Amazon
 

After four years, Nokia cell phone would hold charge long
 I decided needed new battery ordered Amazon
This battery works perfectly holds charge week
Wal-mart carried battery cost close $15
00
 I saved considerable amount $$ (incl
shipping) ordering Amazon
 The product arrived 5 days order date
 I'm pleased product Amazon
 

Battery works
 Since went second-hand phone needed new battery, I can't compare working life original, I'd rate life "acceptable" rather "surprisingly long
" I replaced stock battery previous Nokia phone Just Wireless brand seemed I NEVER recharge one
 I recharge one overnight every day I use phone
I wasn't tickled service Eforcity
 Even though fully complied stated policy, generally I expect faster less expensive shipping tiny item this
 It could shipped first class mail well dollar including packaging would arrived two days
 Delivery time quoted 8 days arrived 7, cost $4
99
 Exorbitant shipping costs tiny items seems typical on-line retailers, though, I guess that's price pay convenience availability
 The total price I paid still half I'd pay locally similar battery
 Shrug
If you're regular on-line buyer, probably par course you, I annoyed
 

I received first battery would take charge
 I waiting replacement several weeks response vendor
 I cannot review product I yet receive usable condition
 

Got merchandise advertised hassle, low pricing etc
 Who could ask more? 

The battery without charge I bought expected
 What expected battery would take charge
 I verified part numbers, etc
 Maybe mili-amp hour rating different issue
 In case I know whether battery fault
 

Item shipped promptly works super
Battery expertly packaged prevent damage transit
Look forward buying seller again
 5 Stars 
 

GREAT SERVICE,GREAT PRODUCT
 MY PHONE IS AS GOOD AS NEW
GREAT PRICE--LOOKED LOCALLY AND SHOPS THAT HAD THEM WERE PRICE GOUGERS UP TO $50


 

I ordered battery wife's Nokia cell phone
 The order came promptly, correctly reasonable price
Extremely pleased provider
 

I amazed easy switch faceplate Nokia 5190
 I thought I going find hard change them, it's obvious it, I found I changed successfully less two minutes I made first effort
 (And I afraid I would screw keypad, something inside
 Not all
) This faceplate truly VERY pretty
 Glossy, matte
 A large red rose background, continuing words &quot;A Rose Is A Rose


&quot; gold print-lettering covers entire faceplate
 Now phone days, I'm happier I thought I would I ordered it
 It's actually better I expected, rare thing
 (And, yes, I see enlarged photo online I purchased it, I still wasn't sure
 But I now
 Very happily
) 

These faceplates DO NOT include keypad even though says description
 The keypad originally came 5165 fit faceplate may go local store pay $5
00 one
 Otherwise, favorite faceplate
 

This decent case Nokia 3390
 I bought 3390 I needed accessory keep phone belt rather putting inside pocket using valuable space
 The feel phone better, considering grip, resulting less drops
 Unless cradle, recharging phone snap don't take phone case everytime
 


The earbud headset works great superior sound quality
 The microphone works well amazingly little, any, background noise
 The thing keeps 5 star recomendation lack mute switch
 The Trickle charger works fine well
 

I love everything pack it's cheaper Amazon anywhere else I could find it
 

You regret spending little bit get genuine Nokia quality
 They work last
 Niiiiiiiiice
 

It took "Standard" Nokia battery charger came Model 5190 phone approximately five hours charge brand new battery came inside box new Nokia 5190 cell phone, took "Nokia RAPID Travel Charger" two hours FULLY charge battery
 WOW

 And Rapid Travel charger automatically stops charging battery full, Standard Nokia charger doesn't (it keeps charging YOU unplug it, means battery overload forget unplug standard charger)
 I really give item five stars, I don't want discourage Nokia making charger job even faster one (like reaching full charge fifteen minutes? Oh well, something hope for


)
 It really quite wonderful item
 I'm VERY happy new "Nokia Rapid Travel Charger"


For Nokia-brand batteries, it's GREAT
 For brands cell-phone batteries, BE CAREFUL charge them
 Overall, EXCELLENT battery charger


 

This charger pretty great does, charging cellphone battery
 I compare original charger came previous Nokia cellphone
 I still one, it's box now, closet
 I able charge phone point dropping signals beeping phone four clicks battery, one hour
 That's pretty good ask me
 Plus looking alternative extra, rapid charger actually costs less standard charger
The charger come two pieces, wire wall plug assembly
 Assembly easy, make sure one end wire doesn't fit, try end
 

When I bought Nokia 5120, came bulky charger took long time charge cellular's battery
I bought charger, I'm satisfied :- It charges phone quickly
 This important I use 3,000 mAH batteries, take forever charge regular charger
- Works 220V electrical network Israel 110V electrical network U
S
 (I needed adapter round legs american socket I bought $2 radio shack, voltage converter needed)
- It's slim light
- I'm using year never problems it
Bottom line, it's job well well worth it's price
 

When don't much time gotta get charged hurry, glad this
 Cuts charing time significantly
 And hope new nokie phones keep using plug last long time
 It seems fit lot phones
 I love nokia
 

This great phone, makes using easy
 Everything easy
 Programing simple makes number retreival very, easy
 Great phone everyone

 

Much much easier use covers color finally sharp refined

Pardon pun, gizmo works really well
 You plug outlet, Nokia phone, you're set
 Long Prime Time television evening, you're charged-up ready another hundred minutes talking
I got mine CGL-2 Compact Desktop Charging Stand keep one work one home
 Lightweight, yet rugged construction
 And power unit small enough don't worry someone kicking power strip wall socket, way PDA power units
I'm really happy mine
 Just please remember hang drive
 :) 

The Nokia 252C cell phone owner's manual says ACP-7U take 5 hours charge BMH-3 Extended NiMH battery

(tip: use usb hub charge 4 usb devices once, I tried works, wouldn't 4




) 























































































This holster good
 It holds phone firmly velcro strap secure
 My slight negative NOKIA logo sits little plastic plate, looks plastic
 They could done better job making look metal/more solid
 





Total waste money
 No matter tried, driver would work
 I tried CD downloads still would never work phone advertised work with
My daughter SOO disappointed
 She wanted download pictures cell phone computer
 

Got cable work frustration research
 I Nokia 6101
 The driver CD included cable actually contain driver particular model (
)
 Following model charts CD basically directed download Nokia PC Suite
 This software package include driver cable (only Nokia branded cable)
 After web searches I found suggestion download driver KQ-U8A cable
 This driver worked CA-42 cable
 Win XP recognized cable I used Nokia PC Suite data manager phone
 Apparently internal differences generic cables Nokia branded cable
 

WE also got cable eforcity - I would recommend vendor cable
 We yet get work
 The first package sent never made it
 The seecond package sent, CD driver damaged
 I NOT recommend all
 

Both reviews said cable work
 In short, yes

the cable work
 But poking around disk I found need certain things certain order get cable function


you also need use USB port every time


as far I remember need install driver CD 1st, download current version Nokia PC Suite, install that, plug cable work


but try orders things keep mind I may forgotten something
 

This cable serious installation problems
 Even phone listed compatible might work
 You read enough stories WEB people bought cable doesn't work
If value time, you'll spend cable worth trying install it, SURE that
 

ca42 cable Nokia cell phone didn't work, tryied another ca42 cable I borrwed son-in-law worked
 Iwould sent back, would cost morre send back I paid it
 

I received product timely manner
 According Nokia website cable one designed cellphone
 However,I able load pictures taken Nokia cellphone onto computer using thie cable I ordered
 I don't know why, message I get computer cellphone connected, fact connected
SincerelyTerry Elbin 

I received order great condition two days estimated delivery date
 I'm using thisNokia CA-42 Compatible USB Data Cablewith Nokia 6103 phone
 The latest CA-42 cable driver Nokia's site doesn't seem work it
 But DOES work fine old driver provided CD, latest version Nokia PC Suite (7
0
8
2) website
 No Complaints
 

Never could get work phone
 Downloaded current drivers program nothing
 Thankfull cheap, goes saying ya get ya pay for












 

I read reviews here, thought I'd take chance
 I tried connecting via PC Suite
 I tried CA-42 drivers web
 I went install software enclosed CD, got warning message saying software confirmed compatible Windows continuing could cause damage computer/system
 I tried downloading driver (KQ-U8A) one viewers recommended, could get cable recognize phone connected, matter I tried
I finally broke & bought Nokia branded cord, worked like charm, right box
 My recommendation: don't bother cord
 You may able get work, you're likely end go something else anyway
 

I bought month back nokia 6103
 The cable works fine
 The problem I installing driver vista machine
 But searched net Nokia discussion forum easy task
 I would say good deal
 

I must say cable didn't work I expected I tried installing provided CD drive failed connect
 Tried Nokia Suite phone model, cable didn't connect failed work
 However, everything failed
 I don't suggest buying cable I already spent ~$10 w/shipping cable
I tried using methods reviewers no, didn't work
 FFS, I mad now
 

The product good quality
 Would recommend purchasing anyone
 GREAT BUY
 

The cable works always
 It's generic cable original Nokia one
The price right delivery fast enough
Thanks 

cable works recognized phone, phone know connected pc software accesses data
 

I continue experience problems cable
 Chances connecting using cell phone modem 50% getting incompatibility error messages
 Not 100% sure cable reason suspicious
 I switch cable since previous DKU-5 cable wouldn't work Vista
 

It broke first time I used it, Im still able use product
It turned useful helps transfer pictures contacts computer without using text messages
 

I bought cable 5 bucks (plus tax & shipping) refuse pay 30 50 bucks Nokia cable wanted backup contacts & transfer ringtone PC
 I find works fine follow instructions
 I first installed driver CD-ROM, installed updated PC suite program, plug cable PC cable phone Windows recognized 2125i phone
 Other users problems must followed instructions
 

I received order 2 days
 Product excellent shape; I definitely buy again
 

I received driver cd, return item back 

This cable supported Nokia phone advertised
 Nokia tech said made inthe wrong country proper electronic characteristics
 Amazon made good whole purchase
 

I bought cable didn't work Nokia CA-42
 Waste time money
 

Do research buying product like this
 It's Nokia nock-off driver didn't phone
 If don't want waste time figuring out, buy legitimate cable Nokia
 

I bought cable phone I longer supported sevice I go through
 It great way transfer pictures ringtones phone, especially don't $50 Nokia version
 

This cable works every bit good expensive brands I saw store
 Data transfers rapid complete
 Great product
 

I originally bought synch phone wife's phone
 I doesn't seem notice disconnect one phone connect phone
The way I got work uninstall software, reinstall -- EACH TIME I SWITCHED PHONES
Maybe item decorative use forgot explain documentation
 

This cable totally incompatable Nokia 6102i
 I pony $50
00 Nokia version
 My advice same
 The people Amazon ban crooks
 Too bad I can't give less 1 star
 

I bought USB Serial cable
 It's detected Windows Linux
 There attempts, either operating system, recognizing device all
 No semi-satisfying Windows "ba-dump" sound followed "We know plugged something idea yet" Windows error
 Not even twitch, almost it's even plugged in
 Just curiosity, I plugged another USB-Serial cable (it serves far less nefarious purpose I envisioned one) Bam
 I instantly greeted results; therefore, I reasonably certain fact cable computers fault
 I would attempt return cable, I already disassembled USBusiness end attempt glean information circuit board within
 Unfortunately, seems completely encased in, appears be, glue
I expect garbage man won't able detect cable better Windows Linux
 It best
If read (or even can't), buy something else
 Please
 

It doesn't work well nokia 5070 computers, I don't know why
 And CD comes workless
 

Found great functionabily data cable
 Not problems reported now
 I say everything OK
 





































































































Bought phone pretty much plug play, allows buy shelf headset std
 3
5mm plug
 The sound quality good word warning can't answer calls unless unplug unit first
 

The product works like says, however putting phone once, removed one 2 little plastic clips broke longer sit phone unless tape it
 Does work? Absolutley, careful guess
 I NOT pull hard removing either, didnt even notice anything wrong couldnt get usb data cable plugged (due clip still stuck phone, fun get out) 

With accesories enjoy music almost anywhere
 Very useful I'm office connect phone computer's speakers
 Nice
 

BE AWARE
 adapter doesn't fit 6260 model
 I would shipped back thing like couple $$ would waist money
 Conclusion: great idea, wrong type



 

You force plug fit cell port, it's really frustrating
First I thought I made bad acquisition but, I checked package tag said "For Nokia 6681 6682" I 6682


So, works hardly fits
 You find way plug it, 


and patient
Sound quality, good
 As may know, also depends bit rate file(s), headphones, speakers, equipment may intermediate, last two
 

Mic works well clear sound, cannot located far mouth though
 It becomes pain headphones extremely short cable
 

This perfect solution hate trying insert ear buds
 You use standard headset listen radio music still use/answer phone
 

First one fell apart however sent replacement extra charge work great
 I use professional headphones adapter sound great
 One complaint first one fell apart I noticed adapters trully stereo
 Only two wires used connect headphone plug therefore dual mono however price dosent really make go
 

supposed lasted one day
 broke apart stopped working
 It fragile
 

I spected good quality low price I think low quality too, It wasn't
 The product delivered fast good conditions
 

product horrible
 poor quality doesnt even fit nokia n73
 waste money 









































































































































































Well, I wanted something reasonable priced, designed fit E61i durable
 This case last
 Here's why: belt clip solid plastic doesn't hinge
 This makes case better $5 case, IMO (in opinion)
 There cases Amazon, theNokia E61i Designio Leather Case (Horizontal Flip Cover)that ~$10 more, appear better built
I'm going try return guy get something else
 

This well made product design flaws
 The belt clip small sucure properly belt wider 1 inch
 Also belt clip quick release feature
 










The ad implies battery better 'stock' battery
 I find better
 It's basically battery level performance, adequate replacement since original cell battery slowly dying old-age
 

This item arrived quickly
 It's one I needed replace highly used one
 

The battery live similar original battery
 problems far
no cons
 

I know people might concerned it's cheap look origin, actually battery serves good
 I bought last year it's still working same
 

Great Value super fast delivery
 Highly recommend business future
 

The battery less month old hold charge


 

My new battery came timely fashion wasexactly noted
 Thank you
 

So, item little month I realize battery problem first place
 However, hold charge well original Nokia battery price, always good carry around car charger stuck somewhere without AC adapter
 

battery works well battery came phone
 wish longer battery life typical nokia battery likely 

This battery work like realy battery
 Only work one day
 But, pay less, received less
 That truth
 















































I recently bought unit; seems working fine
 Although range unit great, 10 feet obstacles present
 I testing found line sight range close 30 feet
 I yet try unit included adaptor, I Bluetooth enabled phone (Sony Ericsson t68)
 It seems working fine functions built phone
 The battery life far great; I leave desk day charge night
 The coolest thing I never take phone pocket I get call; I put thing ear push answer button
 A problem T68 two modes Bluetooth, one constantly on, automatic
 With "on" battery life phone diminished use advanced options like voice dialing using headset
 With "automatic", phone ask want answer call headset don't press "no" sent headset
 So save power phone
 The size headset small
 Not small Jabra headset, large enough distraction
 It light pretty strait forward buttons
 I heard headset docked quietness, I problems loud enough
 I even use driving window down
 I would recommend product although stores offer 60 bucks, I think I would try products much that
 



































This work say




Battery last long say
They say works 30 feet away
 It started droping around 3 feet 6 feet static
Also hard hear, loud enough
I returned got Jabra Freespeak less works GREAT
 Good range, easy hear smaller
 

I got headset last week works like charm
 I haven't used I wasn't driving I'm sure range though, otherwise I know it, really works great
 I hands back
 I feel like much safer driver
 plus, kinda looks sexy, I feel professional
 lol
 























































































































































































































































































































































































































I could happy I already Iam new Charger especially since I without cell phone since early part October,We thought battery old charger wouldn't charge new battery decided must Charger new charger charged new Battery without problems
 

















































































































My complaint head set ringer( noise makes getting incoming call) could louder

 Though I'm thinking it

I'm going get instructions see adjust volume it

 Other that, I love it

 Its easy slip ear fits great

 Not like one motorola headset I tried thing swung loosely over

 I would definitely recommend head set 

Works good, bad price, bothers ear tad bit, bad product
 

I headset year used three separate phones performed well
 I like anything sticking directly ear canal like bulk blue tooth headsets do
 The design clip holds headset place matter move head
 Previous headsets would fall I tilted head backwards downwards
 This unit works well I hesitate order newer version, may spare
 

I bought BH-200 good
 The person ear voice, much noise


This headphone replaced HDW-3 good, more
 

My Headset came button failure

 fix 




























I've purchased two these
 Both broken within months purchase
 The earpiece case made two pieces, seperate easily
 Simply pulling earboom snug fitting cause case split
 The sound quality adequate self-retracting design great eliminating tangles I can't bring purchase third one
I'm embarrassed I dumb enough make mistake *twice*


 

With lightest use, managed lose 3 ear cushions less 3 wks
 Plus bracket longer holds earboom winder
Now I hear one end can
 Plus falls ear
 I know cushions cheap replaceable I'd need buy 10 packs


Would love find one would stand daily use
 

The Jabra EarBoom Winder finally makes possible use earphone without wires hanging over
 I really like cell phone hooked earphone set, didn't like wires hanging time worse yet, tangled pocket
 The Jabra winder keeps everything neat handy
 The problem ear gels fall you're looking


and later foam cover microphone
 A little double-sided tape seems fixed problem me
 I think you'll like set make sure ear gel microphone foam secured
 

I owned two these
 The first one I used probably two years
 It re-winded perfectly every time
 The ear gels occasionally fall get lost often
 It finally wore out
 The second one I bought, I still using absolutely love
 In fact, I buying two friends see great want give try
 

I'm hard-to-please audio snob, yet I'm completely satisfied Jabra EarWrap
 Though it's usually hard enough find ear-piece fits slightly unusually-shaped ear form, unique shape comfortable, even cartilage piercings
I've piece two months, design kept intact, clean, functioning superbly along
 I've worn eight hours straight interstate drive, kept forgetting I received call
 Anyone concerned piece falling it's fitted correctly give tug see you're danger pulling ear
Sound quality excellent, speaker listener; I prefer overall sound phone's internal speaker mic (as end conversation
) phone itself
 It's almost obvious mention - let's - EarWrap offers great convenience, rather keeping tiny 3300/8200/8800 handset pressed one's ear one hand
 

I must admit product arrived, great looking earpiece
 Its slick, even comes several different colored snap-ons
 My excitement ended I placed ear
 It hangs there
 Why earth would anybody want wear that?
 While driving, swings around
 Moreover, plastic piece connects microphone/earpiece hanging-ear-thingy 1mm thick could broken simply drop floor
 It took 10 seconds realize product going straight back Amazon
 

There's much say item except I'm embarrassed regretful I didn't send back 30-day return period
Here's it's awful:1) It's pain actually GET ear
Unlike wonderful in-ear jabra gel thing I use cordless phone home, takes least 20-30 seconds get ear every time
 Not sort thing want driving, sort defeats purpose now, doesn't it?2) It's uncomfortable it's ear
Rough plastic
 'nuff said
3) The sound quality -- least end -- lousy
When there's even moderate amount ambient noise, I lot trouble hearing party, though hear fine
Definitely bummer item, quite disappointment earlier happy experience Jabra
 

This product benefits similar products, problems own
 Unfortunately everything bad reviewer(s) reported true
 However, I solution/customization problem
The size weight much better products I tried, cost less
 The performance/sound great
 It also lasts longer items I tried, required customization acomplish this
Problems solutions:The earpiece falls off, lose it
 But attach permanently threading twist-tie wire it, wrapping around shaft, threadding wire side
The inner earpiece falls apart
 But "twist-tie" solution resolves avoids issue well
 (So would glue
)Eventually, wire pulls headset section (as similar products)
 The solution is, wire detaches completely, tie wire knot around shaft mic
 (I suggest unit new, avoid problem completely
)The last thing goes jack connects phone
 This part actually lasts much longer units adapters
 (It appears softer elastic plastic
) Once little tabs baby break, you're done
All type product breaks
 And lasted longer overall (with customization)
 I'm buying another one, it's cheap enough, I've already figured secrets
 

By "specs", device offers I want; freedom holding brick (cell phone) whenever I need use (often)
 After using week, here's thoughts;Sound quality: people hear better I expected
 The speaker pretty decent, I hear people
Feel: pretty comfortable (with conformal ear piece), akward first
 It takes getting used to
 It's extremely uncomfortable without conformal ear piece, point totally unusable (see below)
Craftsmanship quality: poor
 The ear piece comes entirely easily
 It knocked brushing it
 Since device hip, happens all-the-time
 The first several days I always able find it
 Within one week lost
 I business trip, although comes extra ear piece ear size I didn't one me
 The device went bag duration trip
 In addition, second day I "boom" (headset) part device came apart
 There small plastic cowling covers wires leading popped off
 It seams like everything ear-boom [poor quality] comes apart easily
 I wonder wires pull next
A keeper?: quite sure yet
 I'm going keep using another week two making decision
 It offer I want
 I worry time, I want (I things concern about, example, answering phone)
 













































































































































































Product excellent; slow ship
 Took week even shipped it
 

The Nokia Bh-900 bit disappointing
 Loses connection short distance ( 8-10 feet)
 

This second bluetooth headphone last couple weeks
 This one stable ear
 You even jog ON
 I tried others everyone hurts ear hour usage even one
 So I guess could counted bad point
 Overall classy
 I came across issues mentioned ppl
 So far I last three days used 8 hours observe problem it
 

I purchased unit reading clear transmission quality was; several said called couldn't tell using headset, speaking directly phone
While voice quality good, I problems following: 1) Volume headset doesn't go high I would like, 2) Doesn't hold charge least 8 hours, doesn't tell you, 3) (and aggravating) reason I regularly go answer call get message weak signal headset phone
 For cryin' loud


their 24" away other

 I carry phone chest pocket, even sometimes won't work
Keep looking


this isn't pot gold end rainbow
 

Before buying Nokia BH-900 Bluetooth headset, I done lot research
 I reviewed headsets different companies also tested cheaper ones
 But, I big Nokia fan
 I always used wireless phones accesories Nokia
 And product strengthened belief Nokia products
 It sleek, convenient excellent sound quality
 You talk hours
 The important thing totally worth spend money (its little bit expensive products) product
 Don't worry order product fun using cell phone
 

The fit little small ear, problems audio quality
 

I bought blue tooth headset I read good reviews
 When I received tried I issues LG VX8300 cell phone
 I called Nokia support told Nokia could guarantee 100% compatibility Nokia phones could nothing me
 I sent back refund
 I wish blue tooth manufacturers would let people know phones compatible products
 

The item working properly, every would shut automatically, talk time advertised, I buy another headset
 

This headset looks good paper, unlike Bluetooth units, speaker protrudes ear headset
 I found everything possible hear people get speaker closer ear
 If I turned volume high goes, I heard person end
 Most time I would grab ear use phone speaker
On plus side, it's nicely designed simple use
 Just don't expect feel it's working you're wearing it
After week fiddling, ones going right back Amazon
 I'll gladly eat shipping
 

N93 doesn't work either headsets
 Not even BH-900 advertised compatible
 Both headsets connect phone, pairing works, headsets set trusted, BH-900 also possible change volume control settings N93 - shows N93 user interface - unfortunately sound gets routed BH-900
 So phone calls possible, audio doesn't flow
 Trying make phone call pressing dial button BH-900 starts voice recognition sw N93 useless since audio doesn't find way N93

 Any suggestions? Take N93 back repair? 

This comfortable headset quite easy set Motorola phone
 The sound quality good headsets I've used, people end call told voice clearer
 However, I'm VERY disappointed poor battery life been
 I get less 1 hour talk time less 48 hours standby time
 I could go week old Nokia bluetooth headset
 

I given Birthday gift
 It's stylish suit needs returned
Pros:1
 Decent (incoming) sound quality
2
 Attractive looking3
 Full sync Nokia phone4
 Comfortable Fit:Cons1
 People complained difficult hear me2
 Awkward attach ear3
 Background noise seemed almost amplified
4
 Could shut indicator light
 

I bought headset it's certified Dragon Naturally Speaking
 It's clearest headset I ever used, works great Nokia phone
 Also, convenient uses simple charger plug Nokia cell phone, need cradle anyting
Watch price, fluctuates Amazon $65 $85 depending many left time
 

I pleased bluetooth happy I invested bit money get quality product
 I use time Blackberry works perfectly time
 It takes bit practice beginning get used unique design ear hook, it's good design get used it
 

Nokia comes again
 I tried numerous bluetooth headphones
 This far best
 Reception clear
 I lost connection set easy Nokia E62 phone
 The negative prevents devise getting highest mark ear clip design
 The clip soft tight irritates ear hours use
 Overall excellent functionality
 

Nice stylist product
 I using Treo 700P
 Crystal clear sound quality different volument levels suit (use hearing aids)
 Long lasting battery time
 I charge weekends only
Cons: occasional loss bluetooth communication phone headset
 

I bought I haven't lot usage yet, I really like product
 I gave 4 star bit expensive side
 But sound quality Nokia much better past 2 Logitech headsets broke less year using them
 It paired flawlessly LG325 Sony Vaio laptop
 The voice dialing features I need work great
 Alot better old logitech fact
 I used scream headset get voice dialing work
 With Nokia I speak softly I didn't reprogram voice dials either (like I Logitech)
 Certainly far best Bluetooth headset I owned
 

Have tried quite different bluetooth headsets
 Very impressed BH-900 audio quality
 People can't tell I using headset audio quality excellent audio artifacts/noise
 Very secure holding ear
 I use Nokia E61, Motorola RAZR, WindowsXP
Only reason giving 4 instead 5 is:- rather expensive- slightly uncomfortable long periods use 

This headset great
 It comfortable wear day
 I deliveries doesn't bother throughout job
 customers hear loud clear boom mike I hear well I actually turn volume sometimes easy comfortable controls
 It true occasionally I would answer call pulling boom - call would hung on, I simply push answer button boom pull - simple eh
 I think great recommend it
 I use treo 700w
 Later
 PJS 

The BH900 works great Nokia e90 phone
 It provides clear audio quality allows clear voice dialing
 However, standby time listed
 I get 48 hours standby 8 hours talk
The boom best feature
 Even 40 mph winds, people reported hearing clearly little wind noise
 

My previous experience Bluetooth headsets Motorola HS801
The Nokia BH-900 (used Nokia phone) boasts noise cancellation feature I found adequate
 People always complained HS801 noisy, notice I BH-900 on
 I like buttons
 I read reviews complain buttons small, I found okay
 I prefer smaller buttons compromise giving dedicated on/off button
The volume button easy employ
 Also fact extend boom activate call great feature
Overall I'm glad I purchased it
 It met expectations
 I would definitely recommend Nokia phone owner
 

After reading many, many reviews looking Bluetooth headset, I decided give one go
 And I happy decision
 Learning put definitely takes trying, I still moments I can't seem gracefully
 But one-hand success rate 98% I've weeks, I'm suitably pleased
 Once it's on, headset works great
 I hear people problem; I don't even keep max volume time
 Plus, fact one doesn't actually go ear makes comfortable wear continuously (I don't like feeling one ear blocked, especially listening music car or, know, singing along)
 Furthermore, people said problems hearing me, probably thanks boom mike option
 All all, I'm happy selection
 

THIS HEADSET ROCKS


 It's heavy, it's pretty easy get on, works well
 I saw many people problems answering call boom, I haven't
(I Nokia 6126)
 People say noticed I headset, didn't say I asked thought sound quality told I it
 The controls easy
 Connecting cinch
If want good Bluetooth headset, one well worth $$$
 

This second blutooth earpiece I ever owned
 It never feels like fall ear doesn't hurt wear several hours
The sound clear one end ever heard echo feed back
 I use LG Chocolate cellphone
 I would buy gift others
 The price right great value
 

I must start saying I owned Jabra BT250 2 years I like lot
 I can't say Nokia BH-900
For starters, hangs ear opposed ear bud
 The "pitchfork" design isn't working hangs loosely ear isn't loud Jabra
I always use headset right ear buttons Nokia BH-900 placed along underside edge means I need use fat thumb control little buttons



I guess "left-ear" product I don't see buttons couldn't placed center equally accessible either ear
The worst problem (probably malfuntion particular unit)is battery won't hold charge 40 hours (even powered off)



if I talk hour, low battery beep begins
 The Jabra allowed >3 hours talk time could hold charge week
Also, carefult purchase from
 AccessoryOne WILL NOT allow return it, replacements

Works Great

 also use BH-904 everyone stockl tried order them
 

Excellent headset
 I've using years now, keep buying there's better replacement
 Every I've trying options one wins all
 

A friend recently supplied couple bluetooth headsets try see I liked them
 This model long, big, awkward put ear
 Most earpieces much smaller days
 Plus, I wasn't sure slide mic feature
 Did I need use it?Also, specs indicate 180 hours standby battery life
 I fully charged headset left overnight
 By next day battery dead
 Fibbers


 

I used several bluetooth devices past I say one best far
 I hear person end clearly hear clearly also
 It easy use easy set up
 I gave four five stars it's size
 I wish little smaller
 Some kind carrying case would plus also
 Overall great product
 If looking product stick ear, product you, sits top ear inside
 

great set little hard get it's I hardly know I'm wearing it
 It easy use, great I'm driving (which job reason getting it), long battery life great help
 This would second headset I would recommend noise canceling one has
Good overall product though
 

Some reviewers issues turning on/off extension
 I simply used cell phone accept/end calls, time, I came really love headset
 My problem I keep losing it
 I finally got second headset (Jabra BT250v) back-up, I really appreciate Nokia - Jabra unforgivably bad (see review there)
 I buying yet third headset, one another Nokia BH900 

Very good headset
Exelent sound,cancels noise
I talk much :) I recharge one hour end day 

Fast service product described
 Good quality, nice deal with
 Would definitely use 

The sound quality excellent people I talk say hear well spoke directly Razor V3
 Occasionally press answer button headset connect hear sound phone display bluetooth weak message even though foot away headset
 My Motorola headset well often
 This annoying
 

An excellent bluetooth headset
 Excellent audio, range, battery life
 Wearing headset takes practice 2 days I easily get ears
 Do read manual figure how
 

I worn tons headsets excited wear style ability use PTT one
 But fit horribly loose sound quality terrible 

This product effective one terms usage different functions, different buttons different functions included
 Has handy thing
 One problemm facing device witches automatically ans time even defficult search, i
e
 odes connect phone even hows device detected mobile handset
 Ha software problems device, know customers using this
Overall rating 3
5 product 

Sold Jabra JX10 this
 No one complains sounding like I'm tin now
Ear attachment stable comfortable; works well either ear workable eyeglasses
 Volume little light thanks earpiece ear, adjusted Motorola RAZR V3i bluetooth headset volume max, it's liveable
Buttons easy use
 No case, design sturdy enough I wouldn't worry pocket
--REVISION - ONLY MERITS 3 STARS--A clear negative, though, users reported headset shut incoming call even answer it
 I've done extensive testing here's happens: first incoming call power up, BH-900 gives Nokia jingle turns off
 If turn headset back on, answer call future calls long BH-900 on--but sliding boom, pressing multifunction key (marked phone symbol)
 As soon cycle BH-900 power again, pattern repeats (first incoming call turns headset)
 If recognize this, it's workable, inexcuseable
 Once again, customers given products really "betas"
 There lots RAZRs there, headset shouldn't problem explicitly say "not RAZR"
As everyone says, search no-annoyances Bluetooth Headset continues


 

My evaluation 5 months changed 3 stars (see end)
Over last two years I've tried 10 headsets, including DSP ones like Plantronics 655 Aliph Jawbone (paired BT Motorola e815)
 The common problems shared were:1
 loss signal lots static (I wear right ear, left hip)
 This static inbound outbound
 The Nokia uses bluetooth 2
0
 I'm sure that's difference (all headsets 1
2 1
1), I great, static free signal doesn't drop
 The signal crystal clear
 After spending time bunch headsets, truly impressed
2
 voice quality/volume would vary, echo ambient noise problematic
 The Nokia sounds natural easy understand
 While design ear, proximity speaker ear canal volume unit easy hear
 I lowest setting, works fine
 It gives flexibility increase volume noisy environment
 More importantly, extended boom mic allows voice picked easily, even noisy environments
 The mic end actually 3 ports (straight ahead, top bottom), picks voice even off-axis
 The DSP echo cancellation really work
 As long unrealistic expectations, pleased (i
e
- DSP attenuate steady noises tones, loud voices close (you picked up, voices heard lower volume), works fine voices farther away (i
e
- restaurant noise))
 Road car noise thing past, even window open
The control buttons unit well spaced easy use, even wearing gloves
 The volume control nicest I've seen- toggle goes left/right (up/down)
 The straight press mutes headset, I've problems confusing functions
 There button middle turns unit on/off, easily confirmed red light tone
 The button closest mic answer/end redial control
 The call also answered mic retracted pull way out, ends retract way
 Very intuitive, works flawlessly
 There delay using voice dialing feature
The ear hook takes getting used to
 The manual could better describing put piece on
 Basically, hold hook 12 o'clock slip top portion ear back part earlobe (in beginning, it's easy bend ear back, do, it's aligned correctly)
 When hook slips in, gently rotate headset (without pushing snugly first) 10 o'clock
 I find rotation snugs hook onto ear
 If ear large, experience tightness discomfort
 That problem
 I solved leaving pen overnight stretch width hook, file insight edge hook (which quite sharply angled hit ear 2 places)
 Since hard edge filed, feels comfortable, I able wear hours without discomfort
 The headset feels secure matter I turn, operating controls hurt ear
 I wear glasses problems fitting on
The recharging cord plugs right unit, need cradle
 I wish came USB cable use work
 I haven't able find one, minor complaint
 The talk standby time superior others I've had
 The unit lightweight build quality high
 I thought I'd never headset sounded good worked well, I'd test new, yet unreleased ones something met requirements
 I may still try new bone conduction units coming soon theoretically virtually eliminate ambient wind noise
 But Nokia best unit today, made believer me
Revision: After owning couple months, I've noticed occasional problem I find annoying
 When I ear while, I get call, somehow BT cuts (not sure it's phone BT itself, I suspect BT)
 I press answer button signal
 I reconnect BT talk (often losing call)
 It doesn't happen time-I think times while, annoying does
 For reason I would lower rating 4 stars
 I still like features, enough problem I want see else there
 Sigh, I probably look new models come year see I find one that's perfect me
Latest Update: After 5 months, rubber earpiece unit tear it, making hard hold properly
 I called Nokia get replacement rubber piece, wanted mail unit replacement
 Unfortunately, I longer receipt
 No way help me
 The service policy atrocious
 I BT I longer use want rubber earpiece
 What waste money
 Beware, purchase keep receipt
 I'm dropping 3 stars
 This call dropping says it's worth purchasing
 

I guess I'm easy impress
 To get 4 5 stars I think product needs perform nearly perfect reasonable cost
This headset fine
 It I wanted ok
 It great value though
If I buying - I would try cheaper alternatives first unit "run mill" performance ease use
 Its pretty much headsets I've used I wouldn't go way pay get unit again
 It works, fine, I'll keep - wouldn't rant rave it
 

I've tried several bluetooth headsets, Nokia BH-900 wins needs, hands down
Positives: The ear hook, get used it, keeps headset firmly ear, (again, me) easily wearable long periods time
I used local amusement park (think giant mouse), able converse spite crowd noise, noise rides
 The noise reduction works well, even allowing conversation (moderate) windy conditions
The headset doesn't need put "discovery" mode, turn on, phone "search", it'll show up
 Not sure Nokia manages this, BT headsets need put special mode
 Also, lcd device discreet


 won't disturb people theater, blind drivers (my wife asked take another BT headset driving, saying distraction)
LCD also blinks green headset turned connected phone, blinks blue linked phone
 Makes easy know device linked cell phone not
 LCD turns red charging, green charge completed
If cell phone headset separated large distance, headset lose connection, press hold "talk" button, headset find relink (my) cell phone
 Other people reported headset losing connection and/or randomly turning off, I haven't experienced issues
 I'm using Samsung T809
Buttons easy find, even headset ear
 I also appreciate Nokia, device, gives (small) separate on/off button, along talk/disconnect button volume/mute toggle switch
Negatives:Larger headsets, it's elegant, love extending boom mic (which, way, answers and/or disconnects call), firm ear hook
Also, wish came USB car charger, battery seems last quite days needing recharged
Overall, excellent headset
 

This third bluetooth headset I would give rave reviews things
 The microphone picks well friends tell I sound clearer
 Although users expressed volume loud enough, I say contrary
 The volume loud enough fact I often turn minimum
 I suspect users may wearing headset correctly
The earpiece take getting used to
 I would suggest going manual see suggest put headset
 It slightly unusual even get hang it, I don't find easy quick put headsets
 But, much problem I don't wear headset time use I call people Skype
Sound input output quality excellent

0 computer connects headset instant
 It works well MacBook Pro I have
Another plus device charging cradle
 The power adapter plug connects directly headset
My previous headset Motorola HS-805 take longer connect computer problem sometimes people would miss first things I say
About thing I'd say slight negative headset way hook ear
 But quality connection, sound, stability, overlooked
 

This 11th different bluetooth headset I've tried past year it's best, far, ones I've tried
 Is best could be



not long shot works goes long way
I use business calls yet called it
 That within self makes winner Gennum nxZen almost works good
 The difference I hear one relative ease opposed nxZen
 If boost microphone (on nxZen)gain decreases audio issue
 I prefer "in-the-ear" type headset I'm always using loud places like airports etc
 The built boom slides forward provides excellent audio receiver
 I still, struggle times, hearing caller
 The talk time, far, good
 I wear several hours point ear start hurting
I use Treo 700w
 It drops pairing semi-regular basis
 It easy pair original phone I've able pair thing
Overall, waiting wait more
 It's worth price
 

Sounds good end
Took long time earpiece soften maybe ear confored it
Buggy
 Have reset while
 1st call sometimes dumps
Good noise control transmit
 Steady noise eliminated music voices still cause interference
 I use 18 wheller
 One Bluetooth used there
 Very few
 Thats I put bugyness
 

I bought speech text pc
 It works great that, good range, noise cancelling, decent audio, though I think hard put on
 Then Motorola HS820 died, using (Motorola) phone
 Lousy battery life - never seems low power mode - requiring charging 2 days use, drops link phone, connects odd times drops, seems also turn randomly
I suspect would work better Nokia phone, doesn't V710
 Conversely, works great dictation, hence 4 star rating
 

A lil expensive side worth it
A little tricky put secure ear
 I wear glasses fact stays well plus me
 It doesen't flop around hear like HS850
THe sound good
 I 6133 I maxed volume use HS850, headset I needed put volume half way
 A people said I sound far away I sound clear
A bit tricky controls
 You cant close boom talking else you'll hang up
 thats minor nuisance device
Would merit 5 stars 4 tricky controls outgoing voice
UPDATE: The BoomReading manual testing it
TO answer call press answer/end button pull boom
 When pull feel little resistance
 I assume button latch
 YOU CANNOT PUSH IT ALL THE WAY BACK want retract boom still talk UNLESS YOU WANT TO END YOUR CALL
 push back want way
 half centimetter LED engage button
I assume might random hang people aware function
Have one disconnect yet




 

Simply best sounding (both ways) comfortable BlueTooth system I've used
 Excellent charge life
 Boom mic sounds better phone
 Sound great, even highway speed road noise
 The ear speaker actually loud enough hear easy volume control
 It doesn't flop around ear


 and


 comfortable I forget I'm wearing it
 The negative "hoaky" Nokia ring tone incoming calls
 :-)Buy it
 

It's years since I bluetooth headset, MANY I've used, far favorite
 I could listen streaming music phone stayed ear really well
 This headset I've people could actually hear time
 The sliding boom mic made big difference
The downfall model, reviewers also written, rubber tips hold headset ear break time
 I used superglue prolonged life mine while, annoying
 

Lives reviews already there: great audio quality, earhook takes getting used to
 No major complaints
 I Nokia earhooks broken, I welcome durable construction headset
 

This Bluetooth fits perfectly - comfortable I often forget I'm wearing it
 The sound quality good sides pairs easily different phones
 This device long talk time
 

Lost original BH-900 last year
 Decided give brands try even though I satisfied Nokia
 Even ordered "state art" Zivio($129
00) promptly returned horrible performance(perhaps due designer metal body) 10 foot range
 Reordered BH-900 couldn't happier
 Excellent range
 Easily 25 feet clarity
 Mic extremely sensitive pick background noise
 I yet exhaust battery heavy use
 My cell phone battery expires long BH-900
 Fits ear easily, comfortably securely
 

I bought first NIkia 900 Santa Fe 2006
When died I tried Jawbones 1 & 2, several others,NONE comfortable, easy wear either ear andas easy work 900
Its best


 

The sound clear little difficult putting ear
 

I several headsets, one lastest longer them
 It holds charge long time, whereas ones would die sooner
Good sound quality, comfortable fit
 Although microphone extends boom, I never use extended
 The quality comfort fine without extended
 

I owned product year now
 I like look feel it
 It easy enough setup use
 I used Motorola phone, TILT, works well enough get job done
 It impress however
 The main issue I lack volume
 It won't put enough sound use car, mall, place back-ground noise
 I added couple holes sound come speaker, enough
 Now, lost ability hold charge, I need find new battery, new BT device
 For money, I really expected kick little but-t
 A such, I give middle-of-the-road rating
 

I bought bluetooth unhappy one I had
 I would definitely purchase again
 I one small complaint it
 I wish fit tighter ear
 Other that, great
 The sound quality excellent, I problem background noises
 Absolutely worth money
 

Best headset I ever used
 Even fairly noisy car, noise cancellation makes crystal clear
 Battery out-lasts phone
 


































This 3rd bluetooth headset
 Gave motorola I got tired charger
 I prefer Nokia phones text messaging works best I went BH 200
 Everybody complained sounded like I using electric shaver talking phone
 So I upgraded this
 I found easy use, small unobtrusive, comfortable, sound quality good: people I'm talking to
 However, cheap little ear loop lost within 2 days, itty bitty little rubber gasket around portion fits ear keeps popping off
 Seems though able pick replacement parts Nokia would like send warranty
 Too much hassle, plus would mean living without amount time takes repair
 I'll update review I actually end that
 But far headset goes, must drive traffic, best I've tried
 I wish made sturdier stuff
 

I recently bought Nokia N73 handset I problems using Motorola H700 Sony Ericsson HBH-610 BT headset
 I've getting constant BT disconnects I got tired it
 Decided I go brand BT headset, considered getting Nokia BH-900 headset I think it's big taste
 Then I found Nokia BH-800 BT headset, justs work really well voice recognition Nokia N73, voice quality sounds really clear, too
 This color also matches/compliments Nokia N73
 I love headset
 

I like wireless headset
 It's small; easy use; compatible Motorola Q worn provided chain use discretion
 My voice comes across clearly I hear clearly
 It small don't even notice first
 I use ear hook since I'm motion time feel secure isn't necessary
 My friends Nokia don't use ear hook all
 I really researched wireless headsets ultimate choice-I'd recommend it
 

Did like sound hook year 


First off, I Nokia 6230 phone
Just received phone case mail today
 And far, sturdiest, durable, perfectly fit phone case I've ever purchased
 I must admit buying cheaply imitated phone cases before, none could stand test case
 All cut-outs (i
e
 ear piece, charger/port, even camera lense cut-out perfect
 And case makes easy still control volume side cut-out covered plastic
Another thing I really like case big, doesn't leave room phone slide around in
 I also love way included button back piece phone, really helpful won't take phone time want take quick snapshot
If you're searching case phone, Nokia manufacturer, look Krusell's case phone
 

Excellent fit world dime-a-dozen one-size-fits-all
 Made phone, best I come across
 The buttons phone almost work better without case
 Like snug glove, slightly difficult put phone, wouldn't work well wasn't form fitting
 Since cell phones aren't going away time soon, inevitably I new phone future, Krussell favorites now
 Hope stick around
 

If fits phone perfectly finishing case high quality
 

I Nokia 6230i I ordered multiAdapt case
 The case GREAT, fits phone perfectly looks great
 The MultiAdapt feature BIG plus
 BUT plastic attachment back main case multiadapt attached started developing cracks bit broke 2 months
 I guess I unlucky one far
 

Excelente estuche




 Elegante, delgado y lo mejor de todo, protege el lente de la c?mara
Elegant thiny
 You don?t need worried camera lense
 

I absolutely love case
 It easy clip take use
 I take photos ease, adjust volume make calls without hindrance
 Not mention, friends think case looks fantastic
 Love case
 

I really love case protects phone importantly protects camera lens, also provides easy access camera
I also love swivel belt clip, easy remove I spin phone around around :-)My complaint would fits much like glove first makes hard push appropriate buttons, loosens couple weeks
 

This case fits snugly around phone, appropriate openings features
 The phone easy take belt clip, push button
 The downside would snaps camera lens little hard operate, I don't use phone's camera
 I would purchase case again, I needed one
 

I used headset year happy it
 The sound quality good people I call never tell I using headset
 The volume - earpiece microphone - quite loud
 This makes headset useable car noisy public places
 It supports Bluetooth 2
0 good battery life
Probably important feature headset way fits ear
 Nokia developed soft plastic clip headset adjusted fit either ear
 Once adjust clip,the earpiece sit directly ear canal yield excellent voice quality volume
 This fits adult-size ears best
 For children women smaller ears, I recommend smaller BH-200 (I bought wife)
 

I quite surprised receive product defective
 However, I ordered one another site worked fine
 



























It's, far, best case I've ever owned
 The adaptable clips icing cake
 


Probably best phone 2005 terms features specifications
The camera different league phones
 It takes great pictures day night offers autofocus
 Video quality exceptional
Sound quality great
 It plays mp3 AAC formats music ringtones
 The mono loudspeaker clear earspeaker top phone adequate
 There offline mode music playing flights such
The screen uses brilliant 352x416 display
 Compared phones, like high definition
 Easily visible daylight detail incredible
The S60 OS offers many ways add productivity fun via 3rd party applications
 The address book calendar sync MACs PCs
 Nokia offers free PC Suite download help manage phone
 Memory expansion available MMCmobile cards 1 gig size
The build quality good
 Despite clumsiness, held together real well 6 months use
 The keypad nice big buttons
But lot reasons phone you:First price
 All technology, mainly camera display, drive cost phone appeal enthusiast only
Second, big heavy
 Its real brick phone
Third, lacks vibration
 Most people could without this
Fourth, battery life mediocre
 Due small battery uses, last 18 hours heavy use
 I find keeping 2nd battery case
Fifth, phone many moving parts
 It transforms many different modes people may put that
 Others, like me, enjoy it
This phone would make great gift gadget happy person life, person needs phone
 Mine locked didn't come bluetooth headset, that's nice bonus Amazon
 

I bought Nokia N90 elsewhere part upgrade existing plan T-Mobile
 This gorgeous phone
Pros:* 1600x1200 camera takes high resolution pictures - better needed web* VHS quality video* Syncs Outlook (but Outlook syncing Exchange
)* lots great software* comes chargers, converter use old style Nokia charger, hands free kit
Cons:* pictures particularly good quality
 They tend get bit haze them
* The video 15 frames per second, normal 30 frames second
* Big big phone, bigger phone home likely
Overall I think great phone everything says will
 I surf net, take pictures video, quick turn video photography functions
 The size makes little clunky also kind refreshing using micro cell phones
And you're parent great way always camera video camera side capture kids doing
Revision: I've learned phone supports MMC card 256 megs - unfortunately buying 1G card doesn't work I cannot return
 Buyer beware
 

1) Extreme clarity Screen2) Very easy use menu3) Awesome Signal Reception4) Good Battery Life5) Very nice camera, good parties events, bulky digicam would make sense6) Great looks, aesthetically pleasing7) Outer screen high quality8) Swivel main display great feature videos9) Good Camera Low Light10) NO VIBRATOR11) BATTERY LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER12) NO SUPPORT US 850MHz roaming13) NSUITE difficult setup PC14) THE USER INTERFACE IS SLOW non-responsive times 

All functionality expected
The button keyboard layout exceptionally insightful 

I'm extremely happy phone
I've spent day taking pics (with red-eye reduction flash
) minimal effect battery life
 But I tried shoot video (7 mins exact), battery went fast I stop


mainly flash seems come automatically
The form factor seems tad long, making bit self-conscious make call public


cutting 1 cm top another 1 cm bottom would got 5 stars me
 

The main draw product obviously video capabilities disappoint
 The quality convenience mpg4 video head shoulders recorder size never mind phone capabilities
 The ability pull pone pocket, shoot video, transfer laptop via Bluetooth, email family great
Aside video Nokia seems put little thought much else however
 Removing memory card cause reset wallpaper every time
 If you're already phone get another call caller ID gets scrambled jumbled current caller information making identifying trying contact impossible
 While phone ability add memory play music, option headphones involves proprietary ginormous data port connector (no standard headphone jack)
 The connector sticks side phone far longer option put pocket
 I guess headphones also seem microphone built making phone calls even design flaws abound also
 When wearing headphones junction contains microphone answer button hang belt buckle (and I'm 6'3")
 This could make strange looking phone conversation passers by
It's also necessary note I've one things replaced due failure camera focus mechanism
 After using replacement months I tried use headphones find one ear didn't work unless I pullet connectorsaurus half way out
All thing takes great video lunacy features combined "Didn't test thing all" bug factor frustrating enough make swear front kids catch yourself
 After all, age iPod music important design make break product $#%^ thinking headphones? 

It stinks
 It's 7 months since I it, it's already sent repair two times (over two months



) Slow, heavy, can't shoot photo unless using hands, vibration, distorted sounds,


 It even hanged way windows does


 Save money: don't ever tell one warned you

I purchase three product husbands cell phone
 He contractor needs secure clip working
 The clip heavy, big bulky problem, clip pulls away leather case breaks off
 My husband already gone thru two three cases I purchased less month
 I recommend product
 

I agree gentleman comment poor battery performance
 I phone 10 days ago I noticed problem already
 The camera poor quality well
 You see strange shining high lighted part picture
 The serious problem would poor battery performance
 I took test cell phone since I got cell phone new
 It last 3 days w/t call camera use, call time could last less hour
 After call, phone die soon
 means you'll get travel charger wherever go
 Its battery life even worse old NOkia cellphone
 I'm returning it
 

I 2 phones within 2 month period I went sprint store order another
 The phone cute doesn't hold charge even good frequency manages still cut calls
The speakerphone option SUCKS
 can't hear anything always sounds like theres fuzzy echo back ground it's also like I'm using handset
 They left without camera would least 1 less thing people phone complain about
 Other phones option zooming in, kind flash phone sounds makes take picture, Well none top pictures terrible good lighting good lighting, The color always looks weird
 Also can't assign ringers everyone phone book it's one ringtone everything everyone
 I love phone cause it's cute I can't stand phone doesn't none things phones use do
 It radio there's special kind headset use that's good well it's pointless can't enjoy bought first place
Also web option extremely slow log internet shut phone turn back make phone call cause wise won't able like 5 minute wait, Why? I don't know
 DON'T BUY THIS PHONE YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED, LOOKS ARE DECEIVING





 

I bought phone 3 weeks ago
 My previous phone LG flip phone I really unhappy with
 The flaw I've noticed camera doesn't seem good flip phones pictures seem blury
 Also I haven't able find cute faceplates yet


I get clear reception, good service, awesome $10/mo plan includes unlimited Text messages unlimited PCS Vision usage
So, would highly recommend phone
 It's small, light-weight, fun phone play with
 

I phone 4 years gave away upgrade, turn mistake
 The ringers loud, sturdy especially place leather cover it
 It may MP3 player BELLS AND WHISTLES radio great feature others "wish had"
 I've owned nothing Nokias never mechanical issues phones
 If looking something basic (radio, phone, ringers, text internet) dependable phone, despite small display/keypad
 

I bought phone speakerphone free (in 2004)
 The quality speakerphone satisfactory (definately better sanyo)The battery life low
 It may one call 40 minutes
 It also doesn't give minutes one notice battery draining draines within 5-8 mins notice 4 bars (max 5 bars)Camera totaly worthless blurry/grainy picture
The phone also works slowly
In case it's eg
 hit menu button mistake stay untill exit hours
 There settings change property ultimately drains batery even quickly
 And thing bothersome turn alarm phone turns alarm work





In short I would never buy NOKIA again
 

I phone three months hated it
 first camera HORRIBLE
 worst camera phone ever had
 vision also slow often quit me
 battery also HORRIBLE
 got 3/5 day without charging it
 reception good thing
 never droped call
 overall would advise phone anyone age group
 

I AT&T NEC 525 decided pay $175 switch Sprint
 I called asked much camera phone speaker cost said get Sanyo PM-8200 beast phone, costs $130, said did'nt want spend $100 said get Nokia PM-6225 $70, flip phone, said okay
 When got 10:00 A
M I charged it, 10:15 A
M
 left alone go somewhere 3:45PM 5 hours said full battery
 About 45 Minutes, 10 Min
 Vision, 25 Min Phone I left battery almost gone 10 Min, locked keys phone dead
 1 Day I went visit dad day I tired horrible phone went Sprint Store
 When I got I happy Sanyo PM-8200 $100
 When 15 Minute wait I got see represenitive said since telesales order I return telesales
 Then I mad asked manager let it
 Then tried chare $70 $30 difference, manager fix did
 wish lady would told promotion I would problem
 

Had Samsung phone several years, recently replaced Sanyo PM-8200, superb speaker phone ability, easy use web navigation, pretty darn good camera capability
 The weak point it's got poor signal reception (slightly better Samsung)
 Only area I problem reception house
 ^^Just added Nokia plan, thing exellent reception
 As far web, camera speaker capability concerned, phone doesn't seem made that
 And I agree turning phone biggest flaw, I don't long nail
 :-( 

camera
 speaker phone
 stereo FM radio
 two places plug headsets
 store 400 phone numbers
 email, internet
 lot more


Don't even listening viewers' words
 Go research
it gets great signals
 I samsung, waste money brand
 Made Korea, make good stuff? Go figure
 Nokia company enrope
 If go asia europe, majority cell phones see street Nokia
 Only stupid "Bush controled" country use damn samsung LG etc
Take look gave bad reviews, midwest, southern states
 Freaking farmers corn eater
 Just like voted Bush
wake "brainwashed bush controled" people
 Get side box
 

I've phone 3 weeks now, pretty happy it
 My previous phone Motorola Timeport (Startac-style) flip-phone, I happy with
As Nokia 6225


Pros:-good size


not small-good reception-speakerphone works acceptably (for hands free operation needed; people end report bit static/echo, expected speakerphone device small)-camera gratuitous neat feature (be aware Picture Mail cost extra intend use camera)-lots features (calendar, voice recorder, speakerphone, camera, web, contacts, voice dial, FM radio [only special headphones double antenna, though],etc) might come handy-no attenna jutting cornerCons:-weak battery life


Two hours talk time Nokia optimism
 Whereas I could go days old phone normal use (a calls per day), one needs recharged every day longish phone call (an hour) doesn't give much warning shutting off
 Consider getting extra battery car charger extra charger work, etc
-stupid ring tones
 Why can't provide simple ringers? You've got go online find buy want normal ringers
 (This minor gripe
)-While inactive (when use little bit inactivity [such long pause loading picture typing message]), backlight screen turns screen virtually invisible
 I'm sure &quot;sleep&quot; time might adjustable
-small keys space them
 I find I press keys fingernails fingertip might press multiple keys
 

I got Nokia PM-6225 phone month ago I generally pleased it
 This phone PCS Vision Enabled, means take advantage online features Sprint offers 15 dollar fee per month
 This includes downloading games, ringtones, applications, screensavers cost extra money
 It also includes web access, email, text messaging
 This phone also comes digital camera, though resolution poor camera phones go
 You take pictures using phone send email anyone computer camera phone
 The games look great 128x128 pixel display, though keypad feel bit cramped
 You access web 60 percent times try, blamed Sprint service, phone may different places New York
 When gain access runs pretty well takes 5 seconds load page good mobile phone
 The reception clear time, voices usually sound good though get staticky occassionally
 The phone comes speakerphone feature works pretty well although people line told voice appears distant times
 The phone also gives ability listen FM radio, though requires extra 30 dollars buy antennae/headset
 The reasons phone receive five stars were:-Fairly low quality digital pictures
-The power button top phone stick hard turn phone on/off
-You cannot gain access web good portion time
-The keypad feel cramped playing games
-The screen hard read bright sunlight
Overall Nokia PM-6225 great option Sprint customer wants cheap, PCS enabled camera phone, I would recommend it
 (The Nokia 6200 ATandT essentially phone without camera feature
) 

Pros:Decent battery lifeYou set profiles profile diffrent setting ringer,screensaver etcYou group contacts VIP,Family etc phone ring call family 

Cons:There always constant hiss speaker
( comparing sanyo)Squeaky noise- looks like something going fall off

 whenever press button hear sqeak
Camera absolutely useless


 Minimal resolutionSpeakerphone loud
I would want use speakerphone drive, This loud enough road noise
 I hardly hear anyone ( I live NJ 

 know would drive slow
) 

I using Nokia brand phones close 10 years now
 I tried Ericssons, Panasonics, Samsungs, etc


 I still prefer Nokias them
 For starters, menu design great technically inept older folks want basics
 My favorite Nokia models 6160, 6162, 5160
 Those models ran TDMA platform AT&T service provider one CDMA
 This particular model pretty basic
 I hate flip phones one options available me
 The display pretty good - clear graphics color
 I'm big fan keypad layout - dips middle I prefer flat
 I like fact backlighted though
 Talktime standby time plentiful enough standard user
 Hands free options model stink
 I haven't found one I like yet
 In lieu decent headset I've using speakerphone option works pretty good
 I don't need camera phone could without stuff like invest case phone otherwise less year viewfinder get scratched due terrible location
 Additionally, I prefer keylock function older models
 Used could hold endkey would lock
 This model requires press menu * option
 If looking basic gear inexpesive side phone way go
 

I downgrade phone recently, I needed cash Treo luxury necessity
 So, I sold Treo bought Nokia 6225
 I shouldn't done that
 Even whatever deals I got pocket cash I wound fact, got worst phone I owned
First off, built-in camera stinks
 Now, I understand people say it's VGA camera, it's meant make prints
 I don't mean that
 I mean compared VGA cameras phones, one stinks
 It's constantly blurry grainy, even best lighting, noticeable discoloration aberration lowered lighting
 I've played cameraphones, none picture quality bad
 Even Sony Ericcson T610, smaller picture file better results
And then, let's forget Sprint disabled ability beam pictures devices, mean use PictureMail service way keep pics
 Too bad pay $$$ month service
 It's good thing picture quality stinks, I probably wouldn't even want keep pictures anyway, thus saving money
The reception phone decent, however, I receive calls even office
 My Treo's reception, however, much better
 The speaker phone, though, isn't good, I sometimes trouble hearing person line unless I pressed ear certain way
And then, battery life stinks, too
 After 30 minute call checking football scores times, phone two bars, I take another five minute call, I need worry phone die me
 Terrible
The positive thing phone it's small light, it's easy pocket
You get pay for, phone shows it
 Spend money buy better phone--you'll glad
 

I like phone, many features - camera, infra red synch laptop, Nokia easy menus, pictures assigned contacts
 

I long time customer Nokia tried brands Nokia brand really gives consistently good service I count on
 I got pair phones - one one son
 And strengths weaknesses both
 As far noise makes takes photos - change sound silent prefer
 The camera doesn't take expremely clear photos honestly half camera phones I seen problem devoting enough pixel space - it's camera phone
 I really like reliability service though
 Battery lasted really long time didn't problem missed messages dropped calls like I'd phones
 The big problem - stand tough beating son put cell phone through
 ONly lasted year connective case started fall apart, switch stopped working, face got scratched


the mechanics great outer components way fragile unless buy case careful gentle person
 

Sprint great, phone not
 I bought wife since matched UI old ATT nokia
 She HATES phone three reasons:1
 My wife needs charge every night, whether used not
 Sprint says normal small battery
2
 The buttons impossible use driving since flow together
3
 When go unlock phone screen doesn't light upIf Nokia came battery lasted twice long - even phone ended bigger - could deal it
 As I directed "she must obeyed" get new Treo ships, sprint phone except piece junk
 

The phone battery drains quickly, problem may Sprint service phone, cause I used phone GSM service battery lasted approx 3-5 days abttery lasts barely day(with talk time 15-30 mins)
 

I like little Nokia PM
 When I went buy I wanted cheapest phone little better LG I using
 I land phone cut people call cell phone
 I going get plain Nokia one sale 10
00 more
 My college age kid Sanyo 8200 I won't lie camera fantastic zooms flash extra 10
00 I always camera handy pics come pretty decent
 They always look better PC
 I haven't used radio phone
 I didn't get purpose I headset
 Sprint's decent I got Sprint store price good deal
 Cell phones expensive due gadgets
 This good basic phone
 Don't expect expensive phone reception expensive phone camera options paying bare minimum cell phone
 I give A
 It serves purpose
 Has phone book I don't lose calls like I old LG phone
 






























































































































































































































































































































switched Motorola back Nokia 4 year hiatus
 I've returned phone even making call, I can't review call quality
 My impressions "playing" 6102i limited time I it:-At home Nokia full signal strength (bars) Motorola partial would emergency service only
 Nokias always better connection phones; one seems others
-Everything easy use understand
 Took hour go "Motorola-speak" "Nokia-speak" brain, even reversing key functions two companies models
-I can't evaluate call volume since I never made any, alert sounds phone LOUD played highest settings
 Almost loud
 I don't know people saying can't get phone loud enough
 My guess either wrong profile use (sound settings made different profiles), can't figure operate simple volume control
-A simple $9 $10 plug-in 3rd party source made phone sync Mac, even though supported iSync
-Bluetooth connection flawless, albeit Motorola I could automatically accept future transfers 'trusted' pairing
 It seems Nokia requires confirmation every time, although maybe I didn't play enough find this
-The camera took MUCH better clearer photos old Motorola V507-The address book address book SHOULD be: enter first 2 3 letters name pops (unlike Motorola software enter first letter, scroll letter's entries, frustrating dangerous vehicle)
-I'm tall person large hands/fingers
 I originally wanted Nokia 6682 came I played Cingular store, I realized fingers large buttons
 I could never dial number correctly, keys small/close enough I would hit multiple buttons once
 The 6102i buttons much easier use, probably flat, rows spaced apart in-line instead raised curved
Why I returned phone:If LOT contacts (in case, seems anything 200-250), phone you
 At 1/2 2/3 address book, phone displayed "low memory" alert
 I erased every system wallpaper, screensaver, picture frame, clipping, etc
 I could find, still could get entire address book phone
That said, I wish I could kept phone
 Cingular's Nokia offering slim, I've always found Motorola's software sluggish counter-intuitive
 Without another phone available features I need (Bluetooth, Camera LOTS contact storage) looks like I'm going go back Motorola :-(I give phone 4 stars normal/casual user, phone ideal
 

I used Nokia phones 11 years: 2100, 6100, 5100, 6200
 I nervous one read 6210 reviews, concerns unfounded
For complain low volume earpiece, try setting "automatic volume control" on
 With option set, earpiece volume loud enough
 

I using Nokia phones years now, always great reception coverage
 I decided switch flip phone wanted nokia too, awesome phone
 It gets great reception anywhere clear bell
 Also important battery life last forever

 It comes great features- camera, radio, bluetooth
 I recommend phone anyone
 

I bought phone reasons: Nokia's reliability quality, big rebate Amazon advertised, features Amazon claimed phone had
 The Nokia reliability quality things I got
Amazon claims rebate apply I renewing Cingular contract, opposed signing NEW phone number
 As I read description (which since removed website), I sign new 2-year contract Cingular
 The stipulation I currently middle existing contract, I currently month-to-month plan
 Amazon says I don't get rebate
 (Live learn, I guess
 Get writing first
)Worse yet, Amazon writes following description phone:"There's also input accept universal hands-free headsets, well USB infrared ports transferring data handset
"(There NO USB port phone
 It's even mentioned Nokia User Guide
 If expecting use USB, I was, must purchase optional adapter cable ($25) USB connectivity
 And connector bottom phone NOT "universal" connector -- proprietary Nokia Pop-Port connector
 Hardly "universal"
 You won't able use headset
)Amazon continues erroneous description:"This update 6101 6102 adds Bluetooth wireless technology mix
 This clamshell GSM phone also includes 


 [a] stereo FM radio


"(Amazon somehow forgets mention "A compatible headset enhancement needs attached device FM radio function properly
" [Nokia 6102i User Guide, pg
 73])Otherwise, I suppose it's nice phone
 Sounds good
 Works well
 Nice simple camera
 Easy menus
 Nice displays
I can't trust Amazon anymore
 And cautious I was
 The response they've given "return phone" I don't like it
 Thanks Amazon
 I'll keep mind rest holiday shopping
 

My favorite phones Nokia 6230 best
 It small, great functionality, easy use Bluetooth, etc
 The 6102i flip phone version 6230 plain simple
 It exact look, feel features 6230
 The phone gets great reception, light compact, bluetooth works perfect takes decent pictures
 My previous Nokia 6682 took better pictures flash, 6102i not
 Anyway, really want great pictures go buy digital camera phone
 One last important point: make sure get SIM card 64K memory, 32K memory
 The people complaining memory storage space must purchased phone first came '05 32K memory
 I got one 2 days ago 64K memory makes big difference
Update 4/9/07: Ok, phone perfect
 Why? Because camera sucks impossible get cable works phone computer sync contacts upload crappy photos
 I cable Nokia I tried weeks get stupid thing work computer won't
 I PC Suite PC, cable won't work
 grrrrrrrrr


 frustrating
 

Pros:CompactGreat battery lifeLittle/No cost phoneCons:Cheap casingPoor sound qualityBad camera 

This phone feels basic, it's superstylish, doesn't really really "sexy" features
 The camera so-so
 It speakerphone voice dialing
The reason I gave 5 stars that, terms primary functions cell phone, i
e
, making receiving calls, superb
 I live "moderate signal area," Motorola V3r sounded awful house
 The LGCU500 didn't ring people tried call, went straight voicemail
 But everyone says sound great Nokia 6102i, including speakerphone
 I trying get phone coolo features, end, I need phone
The phone plastic, design OK
 It doesn't feel cheesy, slick fashionable
 It's remarkably big small
 The functions reasonably easy figure out
For someone makes calls weak signal areas, I'd definitely recommend phone
 If you're trying impress people, probably won't ;) 

This new phone I bought Cingular discount good, great
 The ONE thing I really don't like phone volume
 I barely hear someone end
 Even turning volume way turning noise detection program off


still nothing
 My Nokia 6010 much better
 The camera okay, nothing great
 Turning thing takes forever



much slower Nokia, 3 years old
 Yes, radio, BUT BUY headset able listen



rip off
I like: The MP3 ringtone, speaker phone Bluetooth capability
 I love Nokia's customer friendly/ease use
 I keep phone cheap it's really, really bad
 But want something better volume/ speaker higher resolution camera, look elsewhere

Harrisburg, PA 

I ordered Nokia 6102i directly Cingular without knowing anything it
 I got little nervous search began reading reviews CNET
 After reading several negative comments I totally prepared NOT like phone, full intention sending back
I actually impressed (though camera images but, hey, I didn't buy phone take pictures)
 It's plenty sophisticated needs
 Love way bluetooth pairs car
 

I must start saying I impressed call quality phone; I loyal Motorola customer I used Razr (which boyfriend change like poor call quality); I heard Nokia reputation decided give try I regrets far
 The thing taking become used menus, waaaaay different Motorola, price can't beat it
 

After devoted fan Nokia phones, I decided stray last phone purchased Motorola V400
 It great flip phone ton great features Nokia could never come close touching
 So, falling love phone, new phone pretty big shoes fill


 that's I saw her, Nokia 6102i
 She small thin sleek, black gray, clamshell design
 Her little stub antenna, built camera, Bluetooth technology front external display features first grabbed eye
 Could "The One" steal heart???[


] 

The size cell phones continues shrink I really wonder one finally built Dick Tracy-style video-phone-watch
 None pictures really justice portable phone is, dimensionally it's smaller average business card, though obviously much thicker
I settled phone seeing father-in-law's, also 6102i
 I've read reviews talk finish flaking, scratches, etc
, he's year, carries around pants pocket I've seen drop once
 It still looks great
As others noted, phone loaded slew options, many navigating around intimidating requires time practice master
 And options intuitive
 Still, reasonably talented teenager could figure functions without referring manual (at least reasonably talented teenagers did
)My favorite functionality able sync phone contact list appointments
 I really nervous attempting I 750+ contacts many, many appointments
 But (after purchasing optional CA-42 data cable downloading free PC suite software) worked like champ gives much easier (and faster) method downloading ring tones, pictures, etc
 I found ample support web manual sync phone, create ring tones, generally personalize new phone
One bit advice concerning contact lists - large mine, scrolling 750+ names going drag
 So I sync full list one time, go back PC Suite Sync options change setting update calendar
 Then began laborious task working way phone list, deleting everyone except family members friends I actually wanted there
As others noted, battery life really great
 I remember first cell phone middle 90's - I carry charger around ever I went and, call important, I'd plug first
 On average, even daily use, I've noticed I go approximately two three days charging
 That's pretty darn good
Security phone so-so, that's true every phone I've ever used
 All phones offer option mandating PIN input phone turned on, stays turned never prompts again
 I understand true - wants extra 4 10 digits want make call? Still, bothers I lose phone, it's stolen, odds it'll and, least battery dies, ever browse web, call world, access address book (and pictures know else) I notice it's gone call provider shut SIM
 What I really want phone that'll need pin make call access address book, I'm InfoSec guy anal-retentive considered asset, rather detriment, career field
As far options, I've used camera (to prove worked) quality pretty good
 I've noticed get good pictures really adequate lighting (well, okay, broad daylight) even interior shots fair middling
 I've played Tetris game sitting dentist's waiting room, I haven't really used many, many tools phone provides
I complaints, they're really minor
 For example, there's way set "day view" calendar
 When open calendar, defaults month view, current date selected, select day see list appointments
 Annoying, since I use calendar function reminder appointments I've set PC, it's big deal
 Also, appears way change default appointment tone, disappoints slightly
And far Dick Tracy watch concerned - needs wear watch anymore? If wasn't fact I love look style Invicta Swiss Diver (and fact it, unlike Nokia 6102i, waterproof) I'd never need wear one
 

I've phone little 6 months
 It poor performer causes problems it's worth
 My recommendation consider something else unless really like style buy new phone every months
Here gripes:1
 The black undercoating starting flake inside front flip phone
 Scratches blemishes really noticable
2
 It consistently fails read SmartID card precluding use phone unless power restart
 Will read "Insert SmartChip
" Just checked it's recharging guessed - says now
3
 Periodically phone fail identify access number voicemail takes forever figure retrieve usable number
4
 It takes awhile figure menu options
 The phone stacked options get spend money add ons, takes life get call history easily swich silent mode
 I maybe use 1/20 stuff do
5
 There often long periods open phone says "running" prevents call cycles - really irritating
6
 Got real careful saving numbers phone vs
 smart card
 It's real easy move number phone card
7
 The phone real low level volume comes earpiece
 Unlike last phone, I've got really concentrate hear callers background noise
 I say it's got loud ring good
On plus side, look nice right box, it's got good battery allow SmartCard reading indicator, it's got pretty good reception
 

I got phone easy figure even though I've never flip phone
 I went book got everything set up
This said, phone would light someone called
 I went reset tones
 Finally I called Cingular call Nokia
 Nokia said something wrong Normal setting, it's set normal, outdoors, meetings etc
 I could either set outdoors ringer turned return call Cingular tell Nokia told me
 I called Cingular ship back sent replacement
 I liked everything phone except didn't ring vibrate unless set outdoors
 

Nokia quality used ot be
 After less year normal use, & purse & pockets, essentially useless
 The plastic around antenna cracked, antenna fell off
 From get go, paint chipping one metal parts phone
 One buttons never work right
 The keypad area wears marks screen, making hard ot see while
 The button get online easily gets switched phone gets pried open little bit purse pocket, causing unintended internet fees
 -- Don't buy phone unles butler carry around velvet pillow
 -- Oh, camera function good
 Photos low resolution
 There little way camera controls
 

Okay, I first got phone I problems
 I used black razr whatever reason, I needed new SIM card
 So I got Nokia, I went Cingular store use machine transfer contacts old SIM new one
 What happened I like 70 contacts SIM memory said I 250, SIM memory full
 I went warranty exchange couple times (for various reasons) I guess problem fixed (God knows happened first place)
Second, previous reviewer said, 'It consistently fails read SmartID card precluding use phone unless power restart
 Will read "Insert SmartChip
" Just checked it's recharging guessed - says now
' THIS IS TRUE

 I thought I one happened to
 It either says Insert SmartChip Enter Restrict Code
 I clue I went Cingular store last week gave newer, up-to-date SIM card I haven't problem yet
I went back razr week ago, thinking way better, it's really not
 The razr weak battery life
 I used talk 1 - 1 1/2 hours battery would literally drained dying
 On Nokia, I talk good 4-5 hours battery dies out
 Also, picture quality Nokia great
 Another reviewer said phone doesn't flash, use "night mode" it's pretty much thing
 You also add people Groups assign ringtones them, change phone's Idle font color (which comes handy dark background default black font blends can't read), lot cool things
The downside? Yes, memory weak
 I used download ringtones time Cingular's website took way much memory, point kept saying "memory low," telling delete items feel KB space
Overall, I like phone
 For someone phone lot, good phone since battery life really strong
 It's phone that's dependable, part
 It's also cute small
 I would recommend this
 

I've using phone 6 months now
 So far I love many features long battery life
 I've never camera phone before, I can't accurately compare quality photos
 But ones phone takes better I've sent phones past
 Certainly digital camera quality, okay
As other's pointed out, casing seems flimsy
 But I carry hard case it's holding nicely still looks great
 I certainly would trust hold bottom purse someone's pocket car keys
 If need tough phone, better skip one
So, besides treat like eggshell, it's packed useful features I enjoy using it
 

I get new phone since old motorola phone stopped charging, I thought I would try something new
 There couple pros, cons phone
Pros:-Long battery life-Good size-Buttons easy pressCons:-You hit waaaay many buttons send text, extremely annoying-Feels weak flimsy (I dropped first time months, won't open close correctly anymore
)Overall, I would buy phone again, cheap feel it, I experienced, functions like cheap phone
 

I bought phone becuase Nokia's reputation quality signal
 Overall, I'm pleased issues
 Mostly, call volume way quiet (even speakerphone)
 Also, ringer volume quite loud I would like
 I gone profiles volume turned way up
 I wear phone belt it's usually problem, carry bag purse, may trouble
 The vibrate alright - I miss calls occassionally vibrate
 I never able get bluetooth work
 I know it's headset I use headset work cell phone
 Maybe I got lemon? As Nokias, menus easy use
 Also, signal much better previous phone - motorola v160
 The phone seems sturdy enough
 I've 6 7 months flip action still works perfectly sign weakening
 I've also dropped several times damage
In summary, frustrating call volume
 None rest bothers I'm pleased phone
 I remember volume issue Nokias I've owned I hope correct future models
 

I switch ATT business Cingular business still took week port number
 I tried 2+ years ago first merged ATT department blamed completing transaction
 After many, many phone calls & 10+ hours "customer care", I gave up
 The reason switching providers fabulous discount 16% plus I virtually problems good clarity even old TDMA service ATT
 I relocated bit travel lot I need good solid "US" network
 I TDMA Nokia "brick" phone, durable, reliable still decent shape
 The Nokia 6102i lowest 2 flip phones offered "upgrade"
 I skeptical I read reviews phone cnet
 I use Amazon reviews lot purchases found accurately reflected experiences products
 And reading reviews here, I cancel phone
 I ordered RAZR months earlier another provider, Cingular telling I'll need jump hoops thanks numerous, detailed descriptions reviewers here, I cancelled order contract
 As Nokia 6102i, stated many reviewers here, it's decent phone VGA camera plus bluetooth
 I 2 weeks service 1 week battery life great


 I played phone functions, talked 2+ hours, took 7 pictures, IR sync 1+ week, dropped 2 bars 4


description Cingular talk time 4 hours
 Speakerphone loud decent, voice dialing voice recording works well plus I low volume inaudible ringer stated cnet
 Speakerphone one touch activation phones 3 steps
 I phone setting outdoors it's really loud
 Pictures really good quality camera phone
 The phone book menu well arranged others
 I go manual twice
 If you're use using stuff box immediately, might get bit frustrated
 It's sleek nice solid feel/heft
 Haven't tested bluetooth internet service yet
 I'm also trying LG CU400 since phone I originally requested denied
 Overall, I'm tempted keep phone cancel order LG it's good functional phone features I need meets exceed expectation
 

So, space eleven months, I three things
 The display died first one; got replaced warranty exchange
 Was unhappy discover I couldn't walk (what then) Cingular storefront get replaced spot; go rather painful rigamarole Cingular online -- I road time
 Not
 happy
Then, months later, something went wrong hinge second phone
 The phone spotless, observed fellow (now) AT&T; office I went, again, *try* get in-person service
 Once again, dice, *and* I got observe first-hand shabbily AT&T; treating employees local storefront
 This time, even AT&T; employee *telling* phone clearly abused would get replace thing warranty
 Yes, I pay new phone
It's months later now, third phone shown hints hinge problem (won't close properly, display won't sleep)
 My contract point; one dies, I'll getting something else
 Possibly LG
 (I observed tough puppies are
) Whether I'll staying AT&T; main question
 Verizon isn't option (not available area), anyone else really better? We seem back bad old days "We don't care; don't to
 We're phone company
"Update, September 2008: Just replaced phone last time
 The hinge broke third one way second one
 I Pantech phone now
 We'll see goes
 

I've phone year elibible upgrade yet, unfortunately
 It's first, last, Nokia phone
There many annoying features phone I don't know begin
 The annoying non-existant ear piece-if it's centered EXACTLY ear canal, hardly hear
 The volume ringer earpiece terrible
 If finger touches antenna, easy do, connection becomes poor
The fliminess case unbelievable
 I've dropped previous phones before, do, never damaged anything
 After one drop vibrate feature volume button stopped working, darn antenna cracked
 The speakerphone option almost useless-you can't dial answer call directly-you can't use you're actually call search speakerphone button
 And hardly see anything dark screen
I can't wait get new phone
 I liked old LG
 

I really excited I ordered phone, going first cameraphone
The camera terrible
 Don't get phone you're serious taking photos it
Also, poor reception
 And wasn't carrier's fault mom's phone's reception great
The good thing phone FM radio
 I really enjoyed that
So, basically, I already pretty digusted phone, treatment I got Nokia really last straw
I called Nokia order computer-connecting cord 6102i, $50
 They tell I'll get latest Monday (I'd called Friday)
Monday came went
On Tuesday I called Nokia asked deal cord representative tells I need go thru ID verification send cord
I like, "Why couldn't tell I first ordered cord?"She reply, told she'd transfer "ID Verification Department"
I got transfered I get woman, starts asking name, birthdate, etc
 I reluctantly give them
Then asks me, "What previously owned vehicles?"I like, "Owned vehicles?

 Why need information?"She snaps, "This protection
" starts giving lecture I grateful careful protecting knows, maybe I'm fraud stole credit card wants buy $50 cord it
I cancel order total disgust, call ordering department again, explain deal was
 This guy polite, sorry happened
Nokia apparently deals another company (I forget name is) undercuts prices, I'll admit weird, I'm ready try anything get cord them
 He transfers company, also stays line, it's 3-way conversation
The guy company also polite, sorry happened, tries put order thru
 He says, "Hey, computer won't let put order thru


 it's coming page go thru ID verification
"The Nokia guy said, "Really? I never saw heard page like that


"He tried sending order again, got ID verification page
They said sorry, also somewhat surprised ID verification thing, I said thanks never mind
I called carrier returned Nokia 6102i
 I disgusted
 It's cheap phone top off, Nokia won't send computer-connecting cord, rude bargain
I NEVER buying another Nokia again, let alone 6102i
 

I've phone sense January


and it's total crap
My outer screen cracked within month it, pocket
 The case broken around antenna, gray part around top phone pops off, black gray coloring chipping actually see inside phone places, wont charge unless rig charger juuuust right position tape place
My dad, step mom, friend also bought phone time I did
 My step moms phone also damage case, half time gives error saying headset plugged and, speaker wont turn can't use phone
 She's never used headset it, error popped randomly one day
My dads phone broke wouldn't let dial out, except randomly pushed 5 button time, causing call number assigned speed dial number 5 time
 He send he's third one
My friends phone broke too, case around crumbled
 She get 2 replacement phones like this, shes given buy different model
All us really careful phones, I tiny LG phone never broke, i'm much gentle one keeps breaking
 Do NOT buy phone
 

This phone first cell phone
 For first months terrific everything expected price payed nothing
 Three months bought phone casing fell off
 I never even dropped phone always pocket
 The top casing fell revealed antenna falls phone pocket can't even receive calls
 I know least five people similar problems bottom line DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE
 

I tendency go phones quickly
 This one actually made it
 Yes antenna casing fell off, lil glue fine, casing chips
 Ohh summer screen gets little distorted bottom
 But even phones attraction cement, survived
 One thing, save phone book phone card, everything saves phone it's gets tight, I yet break it, gives extra star
 

Worse phone I've EVER owned, first one came missing buttons, two weeks replace, sent wrong parts, provided wrong information
 Screen fades
 Two tin cans string would work better phone
 

This so-called cell phone biggest piece junk I ever owned
 There intermittent software bugs possibly tolerate
 

This phone bad & good
 Most teens, like myself, tend drop phones, put pockets, leave boottom purses
 Well, withstand this, antenna casing pops off, exposing atenna, paint outside comes easily
 And alot phone numbers, won't hold them
 It holds ringtones pictures
 I used motorola, nearly bad, except held ALOT more
 So, parents buying phone younger child go ahead get it, teens, don't waste money
 Try BlackBerry, alot stronger & expensive little better
 

This first Nokia phone last
 My wife I bought phones little year ago falling apart
 The cases flimsy cracking opening closing
 I admit phone dropped times I expect phone take bit punishment
The display screen mine works 1/4 time
 I keep opening shutting phone try get display work
 It appears screw holding flip part phone working lose
The voice quality barely acceptable
 I would prefer speaker louder would nice clearer
I previously used one Motorola phone Samsung phones seemed lot durable
 

I hate phone
 Let's honest, I insurance previous phone, I lost it, (Cingular) would replace phone like kind early pre-blackberry qwerty N-GAGE (2200 I think), gave lump coal replacement
 Another shot refurbished model, whch makes sense since insurance replacement know big companies really like pinch penny
 After 6 months mic going bad, half time person I'm talking cannot hear me, barely hear me
 The phone FEELS cheap, weak, flimsy
 Now, I know I could invest bluetooth headset, I don't want sink money phone I don't like anyway
 Instead I use accessory wired headset leftover 2200
 Sorry guys, phone plain awful
 



















I like new phone cover plastic window part cover 2 little dots come off

I bought Nokia N75 $0

I would rate phone average good
 I buy phone cover asap since fingerprints visible
 I havent nokia phone problems applications - e
g
 alarm clock set one specific time option save multiple alarm times
The battery seems concern many - bad made be
 But bad
 As long remember charge every night, fine
 I would say lasts least 2+ hrs talking easily probably 3hrs - I may bit though
 Runs faster bluetooth enabled
Anyways, worst aspect charger slot
 It usual nokia slot - charger slot phone much smaller - like needle
 The problem I hoping use nokia chargers I I ll buy new one type I want use office
 Surprised one mentioned me
Someone mentioned camera takes pictures automatically etc
 I didnt problem - may bcos I got nice cover prevents accidental pressing button
 Another issue I sim card slot
 It frustrating remove sim
 Not big issue considered - mentioning it
It also takes secs load tasks / applications general - like win xp :P - Be patient
 Otherwise, seemed like good phone - especially big keys real BIG awesome display
 I also like display outside (ie
 phone closed)
 But cannot point camera view display I thought let since camera takes pretty good quality pictures
 Btw, media player okay - havent figured yet I create new custom playlists
 Otherwise would pretty lame

Powers Nokia phone holds strong charge great price
 I complaints performance works fantastic
 My original battery still functioned lost power couple calls
 This replacement one works like charm
 

The battery I received new; seller listed new one

 plain simple
 The problem delivery


 It took long deliver it
 

I ordered replacement battery Nokia 6555 battery came search
 This correct battery company sent tried fix problem, never worked out
 I don't know battery worked didn't fit phone
 The reason rating low wasn't item I needed
 

It 1st time I give 5 stars comment seller here
Quick response seller
Real NOKIA battery
Good performance old phone 6 months purchase
 

I bought Nokia battery them
 It arrived time also cheap
 When arrived I disaapointed looked old hard believe would hold charge looking condition
 But holding charge working fine month now
 

It I could longer obtain good quality BL-5C's I finally gave Nokia phone
I think last battery I tried one these, actually worse performance battery I used year trying replace
These might phonies China old chemically inert, I afraid I can't recommend these
 

product great,I buy Nokia
 company Webtec never sent order
 I gave four weeks sent it, I never got didn't give support I contacted order
 NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM WEBTEC




 

This battery come NOKIA package black paint Nokia Hologram Logo worn??? It seem last little longer old one replaces
 

The battery hold charge better old one I replaced
 

The battery fit properly Nokia cell phone
 It needed regular charges original new
 The original though it's last legs
 After 7 months replacement battery wouldn't hold charge I ended putting original back in
 I charge original way often (but STILL works) buying another replacement
The seller acknowledged battery warranty offered replacement hasn't responded weeks
The seller easy part promptly shipping battery
 Since seller disappointing battery
 

My old battery dying
 I got new one; price great, far working well
 

Use battery wife's phone son's phone, issues
 Perfect replacement original battery
 

Good item, good delivery ,good company I don't say keep rambling necessary
 Why I keep talking
 

My wife's cell phone battery died weekend
 Went Amazon, found battery reasonable price, ordered it, arrived days
 Charged up, worked should
 No complaints
 

Unable purchase battery cell phone Verizon, I found one $5 able keep using existing cell phone without purchase new one
 Always check on-line offers save money
 

I bought battery wife's Tracfone
 It works fine, lasts long time like original new
 

It job
 My phone wasnt lasting long used to
 I got battery I use phone day 

This second experience OEM shop it's disappointed I'm really satisfied
Thank much ready Third order ;-)Regards,Ahmed Wahid 

This battery lasts long one I'm replacing--1 day
 I'm sure already used what, battery life
 I can't recommend
 

From description, I thought would work Nokia phone normally uses BL-4c
 Wrong
 It enough fatter fit compartment
 Trying get in, I dislodged bottom cover plastic (a thin piece covers end opposite contacts) returnable
The price low enough I don't much mind, I thought I might save someone else making mistake
 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
All I say NOKIA charges $40
I've replaced batteries BOTH NokiaCell Phones keep charge aslong original fraction cost
 

This battery I bought Nokia N70


and works good

actually like talk much cell-phones, also battery good 3 days minimum

then recharge

I searched sellers also cheaper compared others
The best thing keep battery run long time recharge discharges nearly 85%

dont over-recharge otherwise life span wwill reduce

 

I Nokia 6555 original battery reached end life talktime gone much I could seldom make receive call phone would reboot midway
 So I ordered battery
 The new battery made phone usable more
 But seems last much less original battery used new
 I reported seller sent replacement, replacement juice 1st one
 Neither wireless service provider usage phone changed last years
 It possible wireless phone network changed manner requires phones transmit higher power something
 

Excellent product
 Almost bought new phone, thought I would try new battery first
 Now I get keep phone 
 

I purchased battery replacement/spare 18 month old Nokia 6085 cell phone
 I think battery OK, phone draining battery daily
 So I charge new battery spare phone longer active rotate old battery daily
 At least I upgrade new phone
 Price right, beats paying $50 + local shack
 

My new battery looks performs exactly like old battery new
 I would expect better performance I paid $59
95 AT&T store
 

product doesnt act like brand new battery, use backup battery dies
 definitely worth price lot easier carrying charger around day
 

ordered cell phone battery
 appears good battery, still working good
 cost inexpensive compared what, let,s say competitors co
 wanted exact battery

 

This battery, I ordered Cellbatterystore, exactly I expecting
 A good quality OEM battery
 It working holding great charge since day 1
 It used charged several times since then
 The battery came bulk packaging, big deal
 For 5
50, I don't need package
 It came OEM NEW condition
 NEVER BEEN USED


 I would order again

 

The product description batteries lists 850mAh
 I placed order two prior realizing 'normal' 'extended life' versions batteries
 I tried cancel order, already processed
Anyways, I received today, pleasantly surprised find ones sent 1020mAh
The seller Prestige Development Group, LLC
Using Contour HD 1080 camera
 

In short, I took battery package placed phone, normally I assumed would need charging, however big problem, battery would hold charge
 Very defective
 

If I buy battery Nokia local suppliers, I would paid quite bit I did
 It works well phone year now
 

The cellphone batteries I recently ordered easy identify among many offered, convenient order on-screen, modestly priced, came promptly free shipping
 One expect much more


I satisfied
 

I pleased purchase
 I needed new battery cell phone
 I search Amazon purchased battery
 This waste money, battery hold charge
 

bought cellphone battery won't even last day long, won't hold charge even entire day,very disappointed product 

The company sent second battery since first one would stay charged
 The second battery also would last 8 hours without needing charged
 

$4 including free shipping versus $40 shop
 It may "genuine" product really looks like works
 

Originally I happy correct battery arrived, quickly
 Then I noticed didn't hold charge better 3-year-old battery I replacing
 Clearly, it's least old OEM battery
 Boo
 
















































































I ordered two reviews written, I get warning
 As reviewers said, Amazon sends adaptors markedly different one shown picture
 The one I received long wire pop connector one end, mini-jack other, "volume control-answer button-mute switch" controls middle wire
 This wire long longer headset wire, so, like planning use adaptor hands-free car use adaptor connect regular earphones listen MP3s phone, deal yard wire
The first adaptor Amazon sent even work, phone kept showing "Enhancement supported" message
 I told I receive replacement exactly one picture, I sent long wire - time performed functionally
 Apparently, Amazon mix-up picture/item number, item number web-site item packaging matched, way adaptor looks not
 Surprisingly, wrong picture still Amazon's website almost month first negative review two weeks I notified error
Amazon great accepting returns (shipping paid Amazon) I waiting Nokia HDA-10 adaptor stock
 

Same comment previous reviewer: item shipped NOT item depicted here, actually quite frustrating
 I ordered third party item instead official adapter compact
 For reason Amazon place I could find compact adapter, I chose pay amount Amazon charges rather buy cheaper adapter auction site
 I confident purchase item listed sold Amazon rather eBayer no-name merchant
You buy exact item Amazon shipped much cheaper eBay, want spend amount money "official" purchase Nokia adapter looks much compact (which saying something, since isn't compact all)
 You absolutely buy gangly Chinese-manufactured adapter here, though
 

The item I received shown Amazon photo
 The photo shows one piece unit 3
5mm headphone jack
 The item shipped long wire jack end
 Not neat item shown
 Style numbers match Amazon wrong photo
 Be careful
 Check ordering
 

Didn't last long, 3 months plug broke
 Not robust
 Decided haul iPod around attempt use phone mp3s
 

The pop port rather difficult port first place requiring considerable manipulation insertion removal
 Add fragile cheap low quality product, failure written over
 I bought plastic connector pins ends (hooks) broke 3 insertion removals
Avoid product
 

The adapter I received resemble item advertised
 What I received mono adapter
 Totally useless, worth paying send back
 

Too bad I didn't benefit previous reviews I ordered this
 I waited 2 months shipped something completely different
 In fact I didn't even get headphone adapter all



I got handsfree headset earbud microphone
 Do ship whatever laying around???Do get suckered one



 

I received product, didn't match photo website all
 I also noticed call button triggered even hasn't pushed
 The result phone attempts dial constantly making phone unusable
 I work around problem switching microphone switch off
 The product either defective, compatible phone
 My advice would stick products directly Nokia's website
 



I thought would great deal, turned utterly worthless
 The car charger work earpiece would even plug in
 I plan using cover anyway worthless well
 

I order item replace previous item, previous defective
 Now new one defective
 The headset fitting phone
 I disappoined product quality, purely useless I recommend anyone buy
 I strongly demand amazon, sell product site loose credibility
 

The headset fit nokia 6682
 The car charger working moment case fits phone alright even though case phone, reception sometimes reduced
 Take case reception increased
It looks like problem headset
 However, good thing is, buying 6682 comes headset really problem
All same, order amazon place choice shoppers, combo needs taken website
 It reducing amazon's reputation providing exceptional products services
 I got combo checking previous reviews I regret extent
 It's bad deal since 2 3 products work order amazon really loyal customers, needs better that
 

I bought turned utterly useless
 The charger plug loose
 Even connected doesn't look like charges phone
 

I purchased Nokia 6682 phone 2006, still works perfectly
I carry time ~ hence window become hazy case tattered looking
The case hasn't yet fell apart, I wanted new one clear viewing window
It appears case won't available much longerand $3
88 prime shipping I felt win -win & order two sets
At first I disappointed case little smaller originalwhich made side ribs case ~ side ~ cover half side buttons
In condition ~ I can't use case I can't get buttons
Since I much wanted new case, close original ~I thought I'd experiment
I heated front plastic window hair dryer 30 seconds
It shrunk I thought I ruined it
But determined make break case ~I shoved phone started pulling sides I could side
Not quite big enough yet ~ & little braver second time ~I heated 30 seconds, shoved phone pulled side ribs & hard I could
And also flap catches Velcro lay flatter
Anyway ~ worked I'm happy new case
One last issue ~ replacement doesn't circle opening joy button
There tools hobby supplies I buy & punch hole out
However, even I stretched case, buttons work fine ~ even without opening
I see comments car charger doesn't work ~ 2006
Nokia must fixed problem ~ chargers I received work right ~and original charger always worked rightThe hands free ear-bud bust
 It way comes near fitting
For needs ~ I got two leather cases & two chargers ~ total $7
76I'm pleased
 

Charger doesn't work, headphones mic doesn't work
 Get better sleeve $1 street
 
























































This battery replaced older battery wasn't holding charge anymore
 My phone works like new again
 It definitely worth less $10 get phone working again
 

I recently purchased two batteries four-year-old Nokia cell phones
 Based month's trial, batteries seem hold charge reasonable amount time


 much better old batteries
 Seem good choice, especially money
 

So far cell phone battery replacement hold charge longer 18 hours worse old battery
 

got thinking new, wasn't


 still seemed work pretty well 

I ordered 2 replacement batteries Nokia cellular phone
 They arrived promised functioning standard
 I would order supplier
 

Since I unable buy battery elsewhere, I thought I get another phone
 I greatly enjoy phone sans bells whistles, I quite please gotten replacment battery
 

I happy battery I purchased
 It arrived promptly performed perfectly
 

After 2 1/2 years, cell phone battery lasting 2 days charges
 I didn't want start new contract dollars, I bought new battery
 Now, phone functions like new; 10 days charges
 

One cheap Nokia batteries you'll find genuine Nokia battery
 Be cautious, others don't holographic Nokia sticker battery identification code
From I could tell new battery, far battery life expected
Unfortunately it's clear product description (and hard make provided picture), BL-5C battery
 

My old battery died lost ability recharge I bought battery prolonged lifetime cellphone itself
 Unfortunately era battery cellphones use specific battery come end
 I like performance
 

The battery I got (unlike one photo here) Nokia hologram appears real thing rather generic copy
 And though I've days it's holding charge like original battery even seems make phone responsive
 Looks like good deal price
 

I checked cell phone stores & stores sell phone products & batteries priced much higher
 This wonderful deal & highly recommended
 

Title says all
 It's still shortest battery life half dozen phones I've owned
 

I recieved battery timely manner (Only took days)
 I found company easy work delivered gaurantees
 Thanx


 

The battery arrived mail promptly perfect condition
 I couldn't satisfied
 

I ordered battery cell phone
 The item got loss shipping(USPS)
 I sent email AMAZON, SF Planet promptly sent replacement
 The product excellent service impressive
 I would buy SF Planet
 

Good item
 I'm expecting really high quality battery since I bought battery three dollars
 But seems lot reliable backup
 









































































The battery nice, idea behind speakerphone inside battery appealing
 The problem presentation speakerphone addon, specifically microphone
 It amplify voice ignoring static/background noises, like speakerphones
I *HIGHLY* suggest want vibrating battery speakerphone accessory, spend extra dollars cheaper battery, speakerphone desk-charger
 THAT item useful
 

































product perfect working good now



i looking forward business u future,keep good work








thx 

I happy quick delivery product price well prouct itself

 



























































































I've phone week
 I'm using T-Mobile, mileage may vary
 In opinion, it's feature-packed phone reasonable price (for unlocked smart phone, least)
The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I experience lags software freezes (with third-party apps)
 Fixing matter rebooting
 I think menu organization could smarter, customize much it
I love default screen displays day's calendar agenda
 But screen hides main menu
 Not huge drawback, confused first
Photos 3-megapixel camera grainy (it also VGA camera)
 Since phone first, camera, also stabilization control
 It does, however, come flash
Sound quality phone calls okay
 Your friends, family colleagues hear clearly
 On end, however, sound like you're talking cell phone
 It's bad, I've conversations better sounding phones
I disagree slightly another commenter wireless internet (WLAN) access
 It's possible set default access point
 The problem aren't location regularly, search new network
 One way around pony cash data plan wireless provider
 I agree, however kind one-button auto-detect would ideal
I don't like SIM card slot
 The metal cover pops fairly easily -- I found trying insert SIM card without reading manual first
The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps much so
 By default, sliding phone completely open -- something that's hard, impossible accidentally -- unlocks keypad
The N-80 also bit awkward
 It feels thick lack better word
 Its 5-way controller button also looks feels bit cheaper you'd probably expect
Another drawback: QWERTY keyboard
 You connect wireless one via Bluetooth
 But assumes want carry keyboard
 The upshot predictive text feature solid sensible
 When enabled, works contextually: automatically SMS email messages typing URLs
Overall, I give phone high marks features, annoyances mean it's far The Perfect Phone
 

I got phone 2 weeks back although I seen cousin Singapore quite sometime back
 Just right box, phone quite impressive
 Many complain response time - yes, phone slow doesn't bother - far better windows machine &#61514; Overall, good phone offers
Pros:* This phone tops ergonomics, ease use, presentation, features, Bluetooth, speakerphone call quality
* Wi-fi worth mentioning separately
 It simply superb
* Nokia's connection manager far superior anyone else market
 It handles efficiently one easily choose several access points save lots money
 I accidentally downloaded big chunk data going pay nose next month
* All apps come phone quite good
* BT sync apple fine iSync
 Also I transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable Wintel
 The phone automatically toggles "Mass storage" mode connected PC, pretty neat
* I haven't faced problem I charge gadgets daily
 I also tried leaving uncharged comes 2-3 days, good enough call volumes
* Symbian browser fast stunning
 Bookmarks feature neat
 Having wi-fi feature helps set bookmarks you're home use wisely away
* Camera quality good
 Dual camera great idea
 Camera settings similar professional cameras - impressive
* Tried video mode came fine
* Battery life, many claim, seems short - I charge gadgets daily - big issue* The headset comes phone really good
* Tonnes themes, apps etc available phone




Cons* My first biggest problem main navigation key badly designed
 It made cheap plastic almost 8 10 times I "selected" option I actually trying navigate left
 It SO frustrating
* My second biggest problem phone slider on, screen light come up
 So won't know - even day - button press answer question "Unlock phone?" - get practice truly pain
* The process taking picture sucks
 The picture see screen hear shutter sound NOT get
 There serious lag shutter click final image
 I sincerely hope would s/w patch this
 I anyway big fan phone cameras - exception Sony Ericsson W810i
 That one far superior camera quality I saw far
* Slider lock unlock feature good bad
 I putting bad section even slider opens pocket, phone could turn end accidental redialing
 So would need small app locking properly
Overall - good phone
 At point, Nokia better phones like N95 etc - course expensive
 

I using week, first smartphone
 I wanted N95 I prepared spend $700 cellphone


yet
 pros cons
Pros: Does almost everything- wifi, bluetooth, infrared, 3g (no US)- Series 60 Symbian blows Windows water
- Nice, high resolution screen
Cons:- Navigation key horrible, feels really cheap
 it's easy select wrong item
- "serious" shutter lag
 Press shutter, wait 1
5 seconds shutter go off
 No real problems pictures, pretty good camera phone, grainy night
 Could used real Xenon flash like SEK790
- Horrible battery life
 With default settings didn't even get day standby
 I found tweaks forum, today fully charged 11am, 1:30am next day half battery left
 Today I took several pictures, made couple calls, sent emails
- You able answer hangup calls slider, I haven't figured yet
 Also annoying "Lock keypad?" dialog
 It automatically lock slider closed
- Haven't open pocket yet, spring slider would nice
- Unless cellular data package, wireless clunky
 Like others said, app wireless settings, expect roam use public hotspots, prepared "search Wlan everytime" hope everyone get labeled "linksys" I prepaid T-mobile account use Wifi data I need, sometimes hassle
- annoying blue flashing LED phone standby mode
Overall I really think serious niggle battery life
 I play couple weeks, I can't get used battery resell somebody else, I sure I get money back
 

Call quality reception good, though I sometimes wish volume could increased bit more
 The speakerphone excellent
 Sometimes I'm trouble hearing caller, I'll switch speaker put phone down
 (This always option environments, course
)Nokia's Mac support great, nice change experience two different Motorola models
 iSync works well transferring calendar contact info
 The Nokia Media Transfer software (in beta) makes phone work almost seamlessly iTunes iPhoto
 Speaking iPhoto, software makes Mac recognize phone camera connect, new camera shots automatically downloaded Mac fuss
I took phone 5-day trip Quebec
 Roaming worked well-- modern GSM phone
 WiFi works well Nokia's "WLAN Wizard
" When visiting new coffee shop airport lounge, it's comparable connecting Windows PC
 If won't need get much work done, travel without notebook computer, great short trips
 (If you'll much checking email basic web tasks, you'll probably still need computer
)The software expandability Symbian OS great, well
 While I like built-in Web browser, I've also installed Opera's mini-browser apps really increased enjoyment phone
The annoyances:- The blue LED flashes let know phone sleeping keeps sleeping
 I put phone face-down nightstand
 Otherwise, I feel like I'm discount hotel across casino
- The battery life could better
 WiFi drains battery quickly
 If don't use WiFi capability often, battery fine, connect HotSpots 30 minutes day, prepare charge phone least every two days
- No 3
5mm headphone jack
 With media capabilities phone, I sometimes leave iPod home, especially I'm going listen podcasts walking
 Having use Nokia's supplied headset (a nice, expected, touch) lack ability plug car's audio-in jack bit annoying
- The keypad small
 This expected relatively small phone many features, tiny keys make surfing web entering user names passwords difficult I'd expected
 If thick fingers (mine average), don't get phone
- The five-way controller (looks like chrome picture) tiny
 I've accidentally closed applications trying move right
 A slightly larger controller pad separation pad nearby selection buttons would probably make much easier exactly you're trying do
 

Hi thereI bought phone Amazon 6 months ago
 In time I chance test, install, uninstall software, let battery drain, test Wi-Fi WAP-GPRS connection well
 The phone works fine, came 4
0623
0
38 firmware
 This firmware little bit glitchy, lags phone startup third party software, I guess normal smartphone
 I recently made firmware update, version 5
0719

2, I tell you




 ohhh boy







 phone ROCKS
 Is fast almost every aspect, connectivity, boot up, software execution, etcetera
 I got Windows Live Messenger, works well
 The camera works well update, zoom, stable, great shots, etc
Take new update phone, you'll notice improvements see good cell phone is
 Even battery lasts longer update
Many Thanks Best RegardsRoberto Alpizar 

I've phone since April 2006 (basically, early one could get US)
 Initially, certainly issues, flash updates ultimately updating IE version made much stable useful phone
 I've tried several VOIP services (Gizmo, Truphone, Fring) good success, although dialing DTMF tones conference calls usually challenging
 Pictures, others said, require steady hand don't plan capturing anything timely manner (ie: forget action shots) pictures aren't blurred printed photo paper would pass photos "real" digital camera
 Video mode image stablization makes capturing movies moments notice quite easy good results
 Having "video camera" pocket allowed capture many moment daughter I would otherwise missed dissappointed I chosen another lesser phone
 The best software syncing calendar (with Outlook anyway) "SEVEN" beta - realtime updates data plan, need leave bluetooth on, manually syncing - calendar always date
 The web browser rocks, limited input (T-9) I find mostly useful checking weather quick lookup tidbit information
 The superior screen resolution really allows cram good part web page onto screen
 I've considered upgrading N95, I've heard GPS doesn't work well that's reason I might make move it
 I honestly haven't used MP3 player much, come handy traveling throwing lullaby's helping daughter sleep trips
 I've tried mapping application Nokia giving away (sort of), worked quite well (I old Holux bluetooth device I used IPaq couple years ago)
 It would nice Google maps turn turn guidance Symbian


 maybe soon
 It quite durable showing little signs wear despite pocket every day year half
 At work, I've several impromptu conference calls using phone everyone comments clarity speaker phone, boss says it's better blackberry's speaker
 It also quite simple make second call create conference two callers


 simply amazing
 There certainly shortcomings, I knew going (ie: qwerty, it's little thicker phones) I say isn't much I'd change
 If good turning bluetooth wifi data needed, battery fine, given capabilities device
 All all, I'm please likely stick phone longer
 A lot phones come since I bought (including iPhone) I've yet see one convinced trade up
 

This would fantastic phone save 2 defects:1
 The battery last day less
2
 You make unintentional calls phone slides open case bag (which also helps drain weak battery)
 I finally found lock key pad requires 5 digit code open
 

Im sorry I never received product though I paid waiting Year
 Becareful seller
 What advertise sell
 

This phone good
 The camera 3
2Mp butifull
 excelent photo
 Only one bad thing I tell product - battery
 I charge phone every second day, still - best cell phone I ever (all previous phones also Nokia)
 

Really phone much I expected, new phone features could imagine single device
 

Excellent high-res LCD, rest phone disappointment
 Poor overall interface configuration options non-intuitive locations
 Particularly disappointing handled WiFi
 Each application seemed want tied particular wireless source
 So, I'd go home try get wireless, I'd bring app, let spin while, told couldn't connect, I'd tell use local WiFi
 It clunky
 The poor utility things like WiFi mean unlikely used anything beyond phone, expensive bulky one that
I check respond email far faster BlackBerry I could get thing get appication running connected via WiFi
 Much better WiFi management must I'd consider phone
This serious example one device trying everything, nothing well
 The device relatively nice, I gave two stars $500 price tag means deliver
 I bought quickly returned phone
 

I think going good phone, advertized price web site says retail 800
00 + dollars
well I called NokiaUSA direct regular retail 499
00all day many want, considerably less Amazon
you would think ?I guess 
E 

Terrible phone general
 I real big Nokia fan I got phone
 It feels cheap hands hold it
 It slides open accident dial people pocket
 The battery unreliable well service use antena
 The phone completely stopped working I train ride Chicago meet potential client
 Overall I extremely disgusted phone; that's right, disgusted
 I ended returning phone (thank goodness I got Amazon
com easily returned full refund)
 The next day I walked ATT store bought iphone
 Best decision I made ever since dropping Nokia completely =) Oh record



If could vote lower 1 star I would

This charger dual voltage small light 


 best I owned travel purposes
 

Great second (or third, lost) charger
 Works 230 volts Europe South America
 At one point, pulled tight plug, connection inside broke
 I able solder back epoxy case shut
 It worked fine, eventually, phone-side connector somehow deteriorated occasion (while traveling) phone charge night
 All all, price, I got fair bit service unit
 It became obsolete I retired Nokia
 

This every Nokia phone
 It certainly fit mine, though model no
 one ones listed
 Be cautious order item fit Nokia 6102 flip phone
 

This charger old models
 The pin big - older models nokia used it
 The new ones slim pin work model
 As soon I figured that, I put trash
 

Great price - buy three leave spending week
 










































































I work automotive shop
 I get cars lot
 I drop phone lot
 My original cover held 9 months abuse
 Several drops scratches
 I went cheap route got "cool looking" one rather original Nokia cover
 That one lasted month
 Actually didn't pass drop test
 It broke first drop
 If want durability original cover, get original cover
 







































My husband I got Nokia 3585 last year
 We nothing problems phones past 6 months
 Each phone sent service (twice
) failing turn even though battery full charge
 Now, display screen one phones occasionally fails illuminate, making screen difficult see
 I think phones poor quality made last
 You would better invest little money better quality phone
 

I've phone almost 2 years pleased
 The problem I've 2 years front faceplate beginning come off
 Other phone great
 I get excellent reception battery still working great
 This phone doesn't many extra features, need phone talking would excellent buy
 

This first cell phone
 It's great isn't overly difficult learn use
 I read manual I could figure capabilities phone
 Very fun phone capabilities change faceplates, keypads, rings, boarders along screen phone
 It voice activated dialing, along able store addresses, email addresses, even year round calendar it
 Great sound, great reception
 Overall pleased phone
 If don't need anything fancy (color screen, flashy flip-phone image, internet, downloadable rings, etc), use phone, you
 

I've phone 6 months, I found adjust volume
 It doesn't wireless web, recieves text messages sign up( sprint)
 Overall I satisfied phone, fun interchangeable face plates backlight pretty cool
 This good phone beginner cellphone user
 I think I'm ready upgrade
 

sounds like speakerphone mode 24/7 volume control
 malfunctions then
 overall terrible phone
 

This phone good


 doesn't (or even many) deluxe features expensive ones do
 There's internet browsing downloading (if Sprint)
 But get better reception clarity phone I've before
 This first phone ever gotten signal room, I grateful for
 But I looking new phone right I want able download ringers check email
 If don't want things, phone best bet money
 

Good battery life, adjust volume call connected pressing right left arrow keys
 

If phone hadn't free, I'd really mad
 The reception fair
 Battery life, battery life, I maybe 20-30min talk time tops
 Standby several days, I didn't get sit there
 I'm one abuse things, last
 I've phone 10 months keypad already failing, front cover coming loose every awhile change screens (really sitting desk)
 The fuctions onboard good, user freindly useful
 I don't play games it, I use talk 250min month
 Would I get another one No, free need emergency type phone do
 I admit better choices there
 

I phone almost year nothing problems think waste time trying use it
 

The main reason I bought headset I opened package, wrong one
 I sure wrong one put package accident wrong one altogether
 

Very low price put low quality well
 As long expect it, it's worth purchase
 The pouch's belt clip covering didn't hold well, I liked style
 The charger works fine
 The earpiece good me
 I rarely use it, car, comfort quality major factor
 

This earphone doesnt work
 You hear anything this
 

The earphone ok, works
 But two useless
 It looks like used
 

When I received mail, I realized case it's bulky outside seams wasn't I wanted, I bought Krusell seams turned in, I like better
 I lost earpiece wanted charger, couple years, pieces work fine
 

case okay
 charger


 could little better price set it's good
 headset could better
 picks lot interference makes buzzing noise gets close phone
 works don't use phone often
 


Arrived quickly well packaged
 Unfortunately, case hard plastic (well, hard really)and snapped easily looked amazing grandson's Nokia N97, little tabs snapped off, corners opposite sides cracked within 2 weeks use
 Utterly useless
 Shame really, cause color rocks
 

I ordered pack mainly ear piece
 It complete garbage
 The casing surrounding plug port cracked apart first time I tried connect phone
 I able snap back together
 The sound quality abysmal
 It sounded like person I talking sitting cardboard box
The price entire package cheaper single ear buds, I thought good deal, obviously I got I paid for
 I purchasing better ear piece weekend
 

It expected, pretty great product, expecilly it's price
 

The headset really good voice clear directly phone
 

You can't go wrong this, $10
00 gets case,charger handsfree microphone
 I surprised nice case leather
 BUY IT
 








And sort worked Sony Ericsson T68i
 Half time cut out, wouldn't connect phone all, wouldn't answer calls I pressed button
 Also, earhook piece garbage
 It breaks right point fits hole headset itself
 My first one broke three half weeks I received gift
 They sent two new ones free one time courtesy, second one nearly broken well, I received new bluetooth headset, Jabra Freespeak, I wholeheartedly recommend Plantronics M1000
 Don't buy headset
 If I could give zero stars, I would

 

work nokia 3650 stated title
 I called Plantronics customer support said 80$ plantronics m1000 work nokia 3650 different bluetooth preferences
 

As I said - skip Nokia 3650
 Also, battery life bad
 I used Sony Ericsson T-68 lasts forty minutes maximum
 On positive side, battery replaceable unlike BT headsets
 

En la publicidad dice que es compatible con Nokia 3650, pero la verdad que luego de mucho averiguar estos son compatibles


que horror


lo que sucede es que M1000 es compatible con &quot;headset Bluetooth profile&quot; y el 3650 tiene &quot;handsfree Bluetooth profile&quot; y eso es suficiente para ser compatibles


luego de luchar 10 meses encontre con esta sorpresa


y yo que pensaba que algo malo estaba haciendo


Angelretamaleslatrille@hotmail
com 
































I doubt case specifically built Nokia E62 little smaller cover handset body
 

I used phone case Nokie E61
 It cool stylish
 I like magnetic button that's hooked it
 Highly recommend
 







































































































After hours upon hours trying get cable software work, It eventually allowed hour connected time, never worked again
 My opinion stick OEM cable
 The extra money's worth paying avoid headache
 

I bought cable last year connect Nokia computer
The Nokia S/W garbage, different review
 It almost never works, usually I give disgust
 But here's best
I exchanged emails Nokia problems I have, guess ? They support cable anymore
 They want buy new cable another $50
 The Cell industry disgusting
 Crappy products, crappy software, constant attempt pick pockets
 This latest incident turned away Nokia forever
 Unfortunately I bet none companies, run MBA waving greedy rotten Suits, better
 

If I could, I would give cable minus (negative) 5 star rating
The enclosed drivers allow connect phone computer
Installing driver crashed computer Windows would start
Not waste money, cause hours frustration
Stay clear product
Amazon list products like web site
 

dont cd drivers nokia cd come cable motorola can't install 

I bought dont work fine
 The software mess
 If buy, forget


or cried after
 

I pleased price quality item; exactly purchased for, provide easy transfer datato nokia phone 



















































































































































































































































































































































































































































The product work
 Is compatible Nokia 6255i advertised
 Please see correct software sent me
 This third request
 There NO response
 

The time takes get door doesn't justify lower price
 Next time I buy simple product like I drive nearest store
 (it took 14 days $5
00 item 

) 

I got cable I could backup phone numbers case I lose phone
 So far I haven't able that
 I able move contacts Outlook, mostly worthless
 If I needed move contacts Outlook back phone I don't think I'd able to
 

I purchased Nokia 6650(AT&T),and fit
 I sure fit models says does
 If flip phone like mine chances NOT fitting high
 Its extremely low price tag might tempting, worth shipping pay, Stay away
 

This peoduct must use nokia S60 phones
 Easy connectivity USB charging terminal usefull connected computer
 













I ordered Nokia Bh-800 using Amazon free shipping
 Well, free took time packing shipping it, I believe took 11 days plcing order get ot (living los angeles)
BH-800: I lot research bluetooth headset buy prior experience decided go "best" one
 As soon charge complete, eagerly paired nokia 6230 (pairing simple), I put headset mu left ear phone jeans' fron right pocket (3 feet apart), could hear noice interfering voice conversation itself
 After asking friends issue, said (using motorolla headsets) live it
 I hold hand less foot apart order get good quality (now, what's point using it?) 
 It annoying I put ebay night sold $30 less I paid Amazon
 I guess technology developed well this
 But far look weight it, it's small light, I could put ear w/o using loop feels comfortable noticing it
 

I tried BT headsets came Nokia BH-800 Jabra JX10
 Both units good audio quality
 I also liked units small
 Thus, don't look like way Star Trek convention wearing them
While I liked JX10's design BH-800, trouble understanding voice commands
 I use Microsoft Voice Command XV6700 PocketPC phone
 I speak JX10 slow clearly achieve 50% success rate understanding commands first try subsequent tries
 The BH-800 understands commands closer 90% first try 99% second try
 I also able speak "natural" fashion
 I wonder Bluetooth 2
0 specification EDR makes difference
Pros:1
 Good audio quality
 People clearly hear I clearly hear them
2
 It's small
 It's less "geeky" headsets
3
 The neck strap nice bonus
 The headset stays place
4
 My Microsoft Voice Command woks well BH-800
Cons:1
 I don't like ring tone headset
 I don't know change it
2
 The neck strap could longer
3
 I preferred JX10's look button layout
 

I really like Nokia BH-800
 I A900 phone Sprint headsets I frequently lost paring headset
 I rarely problem Nokia
 My complaint ear piece -- it's big normal size ear
 I think Nokia men mind design ear piece
 Even ear hook (which optional) still good fit; however it's great fit boyfriend


 doesn't help situation since I got me
 

I've bought Bluetooth headsets past didn't like much
 I've used friends, one I like (Plantronics Voyger 510) big
 Hated last one I bought (Motorola H3) I ended taking back day
 This one pretty expensive, sometimes get pay for
pros:volume great, much louder Motorola's I've usedsize good, fits perfect ear
looks greatpairs quickly Motorola Qlove neckstrapsupports audio streaming phone does
 I hear mp3 ringtones threw headset
consseems bad problem noice canceling, people always comment things background, like TV
 But it's extremeif it's paired, phone rings takes seconds pair back up, isn't headset issue, BlueTooth like headsets
After 5 days it, I love BH-800, it's going hard company top this
 

I always happy loyal Nokia phones
 This first Nokia Bluetooth I quite satisfied well
 I ever used Motorola Bluetooth headsets dissatisfied
 The clearity, incoming transmiting far superior
 The ease use great also
 My complaint ear attachment, I could get stay ear
 I solved problem though parts salvaged old Motorola HS850
Great Product

 Would get 5 stars ear attachment
 

This best bluetooth heaset I owned
 Pairing quick simple, voice quality excellent
 The size fit amazing
 I truly impressed small headset was, yet fit inside ear
 If worried falling out, optional ear loop comes box
 The negative outside noise wind easily picked sensitive microphone, pretty standard lot bluetooth headsets
 

My ears must different others
 This thing would stay ear even using ear loop
 The headset kept losing it's connection Treo 700WX required soft reboot Treo get work again
 Every time I talked person end experienced echo
 I disapointed reviews positive
 To fair, I can't use ear bud type stereo headphones either, don't fit ears
 Also, people trouble bluetooth headsets new Treo 700WX
 So, giving benifit doubt, I gave 2, I leaning towards 1
 

I owned three expensive Motorolas various times
 This nokia best BT yet
 Best sound - clearest ends
 Some minor BT failings BT Nokia
 It clearly made presented high end product
 The metal ear holder made hard bend (for best fit)stainless
 Some reviewer reccommed one go local blacksmith - minor issue otherwise great
 

I Nokia BH-800 8 months still use everyday wear ear good part day
 I use ear loop fits ear right, I would say I quite average size
The sound excellent, never problem hearing people people hearing me
 Most headsets got complaints end able hear them
The reception good, I get little bit static phone 10 feet away
 The range really good, I parking lot 35-40 feet away earpiece rang
 I able answer quickly walked back phone get rid static
Occasionally I turn blue tooth phone (XV6700), turn power Nokia headset get sync
A complaints, I would like able change ring headset default Nokia ring, I would love able use mini USB charge it, mute hard use, I personally think kind ugly, never used necklace comes with
Bottom line, works really well, get pay for
 Just don't lose VERY small I spent 15 minutes looking dropping parking lot
 

I can't say enough headset
 I've gone 2 brands get it
 I problems comfort, listening volume speaking volume brands
 However, brands considerally less expensive
This Nokia Bluetooth excellent counts mentioned above
 The adjustable listening volume actually works makes considerable difference noisy room situations
The speaking volume ability someone hear major concern me
 I've tested baby, listeners report echoes difficulty hearing me
 I don't yell anymore
Lastly, I major comfort problems others mainly terms weight heatset and/or pressure ear loop
 My first set "over ear" loop set
 It heavy either ear
 I keep switching one ear day
 My second "in ear" loop
 It kept falling ear day
 I wished I could super glue in
 The I pressed ear , irritated ear became
 So I switching ears day
Hey, I achieved 100% comfort Nokia, I use ear loop support well security reasons
 I like fact ear loop adjustable supportive heatset
 Therefore weight, though fairly light, seems distributed balanced evenly
 Basically, I wear day forget it's even there
Moral: Usually get pay for
 

Everything headset better I expected
 Quality, ease use, design, etc
 The one complaint I way stays place without attaching included ear loop
 It's huge drawback, would convenient elegant could used without loop
 

The unit small looks attractive compared units
 HOWEVER, I found sound quality unacceptable
 This first Bluetooth, maybe expectations unrealistic, I can't hear without static thing unless I hold phone (Samsung A920) near ear within foot - defeats entire purpose
Other negatives neckstrap us useless - bump right holder
 In addition, headset plays long tone (3-5 seconds) get voicemail
 Quite annoying - ask person repeat said every time happens
 There mention manual turn off
Again, first Bluetooth, I disappointed major inconveniences given price
 

Small, light, stylish, clear, light, simple, easy use, I say light already? This unit sooo much, lacks good noise reduction
 That's reason gets 4
 I don;t even mind price high quality function
 Get wind reduction


 

Worked fine co-workers phone (Samsung i730) I hear connect/disconnect "bleeps" successfully force phone redial
There reports BH-600 works 6131 (v5
5) don't know 6133
Bought BH-800 hoping Nokia compatibility 


 disappointing say least
 

So far I able get headset work Nokia 6133 phone
 They pair & connect phone seem recognize headset
 The headset symbol come display audio routed to/from headset, stays phone
 The headset work properly Nokia 8801 Motorola RAZR headsets work properly phone
 This problem escalated Nokia's engineers
 I'll post update & resolve problem
 Anyone else problems using headset?Also, earloop comes it, I could get shaped comfortable position would hook around ear right
 I found spare earloop Jabra wired headset fit hole Nokia fine makes headset fit much better me
 

I bought husband research showed good reviews
 Well, didn't work well all
 Always static line, walked feet away couldn't hear all
 He used 2 weeks I convinced send back
 

First all, Im Nokia fan
 I bought BH-800 I think elegant, small, discrete mainly brand
 You don't bulky headsets ears
That said, I must admit I mixed feelings BH-800, I used two smartphones: The Nokia N80 Blackberry 8800
When using BH-800 together N80 I found sound quality sometimes good enough devices get disconnected easily (sometimes happens I put N80 one pants pockets) I think could design flaw N80
 Besides that, headset designed work Nokia devices
 The ringtones setup Nokia phone (even distinctive ringtones) clearly heard headset
 Other features like voice dialing redial last number work flawless using headset button
In hand, using BlackBerry, I get better sound quality better range I lose distinctive ringtones (the headset plays famous Nokia tune) possible start voice dialing headset
 I also noticed answer incoming call headset, hear counterpane Nokia tune finish playing (but him/her hear you)
Overall I think BH-800 good headset, better used Nokia phones get best it
 

It nice design look
 battery time reasonable
 People end say sound good I keep hearing static time
 

Have using BH-800 weeks generally pleased performance
 Battery life great; I usually get 2 days I talk several hours per day
 Fit ear great
 I get noticable amount static I get last 3 devices I tried
 Strange thing static callers hear it
 Anyway, overall I would say comfortable, long lasting headset I (it 5th 2 years)
 

I re-sink everytime headset gets seperated phone
 It takes seconds, little anoying
 After hour ear hurts couple hours I take let ear rest
 Other two anoyances works great
 

I've several Motorola headsets (HS850, HS810, H700) none seemed work well consistently phones I've (people always complained voice sounded far away couldn't hear me)
 Since I Nokia N80 I thought Nokia BH-800 would work perfectly it
 Unfortunately, people still complain barely hearing me, I barely hear people volume maximum
 On top that, I put phone pocket (same side headset) I start hear static headset
 Add fact doesn't stay place always falls greatest disappointment ever
 This first (and probably last) Nokia headset
 I love phones I'm staying away headsets on
 I thought Motorolas bad, I found something that's even worse
 I however buy Plantronics Voyager 510 even though I intimidated it's large size, turned comfortable wear (actually feels light), volume great (I keep low I don't hurt ears), people actually loud clear change
 It also works great MacBook Pro especially Skype
 

Works well
 Like fact I don't large bulge ear
 unit fits ear without falling out
 Very good
 

This first Bluetooth headset I've ever owned
 I read ton reviews finally settled one it's size price


IT IS AMAZING


 Being engineer professional pilot I love gadgets


 that's I thought would be
 But honestly seems like art perfection
 Great sound quality, battery life size
 Sometimes little quiet, people talking quietly otherside
 Recommend product


 

I disappointed
 generally always static
 I trouble hearing people trouble hearing me
 

I got present someone
 I Nokia BH900 worked great, I wanted stick Nokia another bluetooth headset
 Unfortunately, I seem received broken one, can't even get far away phone putting pants pocket without losing signal disconnecting
 But Nokia proven awesome brand far, I hope simply got bad unit, replacement work great
 To continued


 

This headset comfortable, sounds great ends, pairs perfectly Nokia 8801
 It one touch answer hang also program voice dialing
 It called wrong person once
 I highly recommend
 

Wow
 The Nokia BH-800 great
 It's small; half size headsets
 The fit great
 Nokia includes eyeglasses-like coated wire help hold device place
 You don't need it
 The device stays place itself
 Before getting device, I didn't understand anyone would need use necklace store device use
 Now I use necklace
 It's convenient geeky looking
 Pairing headset nokia phone cake
 The sound quality desent, great
 I'm hoping next generation even greater sound quality
 Enjoy
 

I Nokia 6133 successfully used Motorola H500 BT headset
 I acquired Nokia BH-800 intention using instead Motorola promised increased useabilty
 I able get Nokia BH-800 pair phone headset icon would display audio connection phone
 I called Nokia technical support spoke two levels support
 All kinds steps done, reset headset, delete pairings, re-pair device still audio headset
 I tried BH-800 headset T-Mobile MDA worked fine-- seems problem either headset phone
 Nokia's advice return item refund exchange
 See reviewer's similar experience indicates pattern Nokia needs address engineering perspective devices represented Nokia compatible obviously compatible
 

This good headset
Pros:1
 It good sound
2
 It good mic -- people say hear clearly
3
 Battery life robust -- advertised
4
 It tiny
5
 If don't like looking like cyborg phone good compromise
 The neck chain good option
 Plus, use ears
Cons:1
 Very expensive -- I paid much
 Better deals now
 

The BH 800 bluetooth I ordered defective arrived
 I disappointed
 It took 3 phone calls I received response option replacement option available refund
 I went store purchased another brand
 I great headset now
 I may never purchase online recent experience
 

Great headset
 Great sound quality
 The ear hook means don't lose it
 









































cheap phone skin
 trying use slvr L7 broke
very thin worth money it
beware""""" 

The HS26w 3rd BT headset, phone i'm using Sony-Ericsson w600i
 I figured even w600i doesn't support Bluetooth 2
0, sooner later i'll end phone does, get headset that's already using new standard? Paid 49 USD this, I've headset week now, i'm entirely pleased
First sound quality, headset decent near phone, delivers clear normal sounding voice ends
 good
 noisy locations doesnt work well, sub $50 headset didn't expect perform well first place
The range headset is


 iffy
 paring w600i, 2 meter HS26w starts get statics
 around 6 meter people end couldn't hear me
 paired Moto Razr V3 range increases bit, statics comes around 4 meters so
 So, guess pretty much phone dependent thing, mileage may vary
Next user comfort
 This headset uses unorthodox fork shaped clip/hook secure itself, part works
 fork shaped clip made soft rubber, feels comfortable secure even glasses on
 however, fork's position fixed (its screwed on, can't remove adjust it), large ears (i do), speaker won't pointing ear canal correctly
 ended turn volume up, creates echo


The unit somewhat heavy, one 'i didn't know on' kind headset
 whats worse, unit's dimension bigger current gen headsets
 length width might seem ok paper, thickness kills - thickest point, HS26w almost thick wide - size pack gum, definately inconspicuous headset
 makes worse front panel design isn't bad, isn't even attempt made making sides look better - 2 pieces colored plastic screwed together
 unit thick, ugly
on upside, pairing headset phones PCs pretty easy, headset doesn't seem pairing mode - need search phone pc, enter passcode thats it
so, it, HS25w 6th gen BT2
0 headset that's heavy, big, ugly worn
 i'm probably going return mine days
 

First all, I thought Nokia Product, would one best (I use Nokia 6600 cellphone last 1
5 years works like gem still) I feel little disappointed performance
Here's problems device I experienced using 2 weeks:1) The range nowhere close 10 meters specified
 It's range cannot exceed 4-5 meters tops
 After that, start getting static there's clarity
2) The Standby time talk time specified Nokia achieved labs ideal conditions
 I could get upto 3
5-4 hours talk time device
 After this, started beeping low battery needed recharged
3) Even within range, I hear constant static talking anyone
 Even though it's low doesnt disturb normal conversation, it's there
 Don't worry, get used within week start ignoring it
4) Sometimes device disconnects phone I dialing number I pair device again
 It's big deal it's simply annoying re trying connect number won't realize already disconnected unless watch phone
5) Its little heavier ones market
 A minor point though
Allright, enough bad part
 Let's look positives instrument
1) Works nicely within range Nokia Phone pairing breeze
2) The Ear clip decent made rubber, keeping long periods time fine
3) Redialing Voice dialing good features work fine
 The device little sensitive voice dialing though won't work kind noise background
4) Its bluettooth ver 2
0
 So it's going compatible future phones high data transfer rates
Overall, I would recommend buying product available sale (like I did, I bought CompUSA 20 bucks) nothing else features available cheaper
 For me, I feel it's worth 20 I would disappointed I spent anything 40 this
 

























I using battery
 The life battery seem long one came phone
 It last 3 3
5 days fully charged
 Most time, phone idling, use lot power
 














































































































































































































If want phone make calls, one it
 ONLY making calls
 If plan making full use features advertised, disappointing
There lot cheap phones recently ability many things, crippled bad intentionally modified software
 The Nokia 6030 T-Mobile exception
 The price may look low, LOT phones cheap days
 A low price excuse bad software
Ring Tones:Fortunately MP3 ringers, much included
 Only phone
 You don't get 20-30 classic Nokia ring tones might used to
 Good customizers (or not, read on


), bad people wanting simple ringers included
Games Java Applications:The phone run Java applications, allow access internet
 This makes many applications useless
 The menu option allow "grayed out" can't selected
 This dependant data plan, phone simply ability
The phone also trouble downloading games
 "File large save" appears, even though phone shows enough available memory
 Maybe arbitrary limit file sizes
The included games demo versions
 To continue playing, buy them
 How cheap give DEMO version Tetris?They don't even give us basic Nokia classics like Memory Snake
 Pay play only
Multi-Media Messaging (picture messages):The phone folder "clip arts" phones would variety small pictures put messages
 This folder empty
 No goofy pictures add MMS messages
 For phone camera, ought include SOMETHING send MMS
 The thing send MMS 4 included wallpapers
MMS also send sounds
 Of course can't send copy-protected ringers buy T-Mobile, standard, Nokia copy-protected ringers included phone
 The phone NO included sounds sent MMS, available data cable, transfer method, options making working MMS messages kind limited
 You still point phone's browser 3rd-party websites free ringers, problems too, described shortly
Web Browser:This may disappointing part phone me, Nokia phones used always pretty good web browsers, certainly better Samsung
Unlike browser older models like 3100 8390, one works slowly, probably due slow processor phone
 Even going simple text-based T-zones pages would pop instantly older models, phone least briefly shows "Processing data" waiting message showing page
 THIS IS SEPERATE FROM THE DOWNLOAD appears page loaded
 The phone trying figure display page already loaded
 On pages kind fancy stuff, "processing data" staring back while
 On really big pages handled OK Ericsson, browser "process" data minutes, display "memory full" (even though already loaded, "processed")
 One time browser even crashed dumped back standby screen
Unfortunately, happened website I previously used download ring tones phones
 So phone hardly included ringers, data cable available Nokia, crummy web browser trying download ringers web
It's still usable, annoying
But included web browser stinks, download Opera Mini like Java phones, use view websites? Because, recall, phone won't allow Java applications access web
So plan customizing phone, also plan either paying T-Mobile money headache trying download free content like everyone else phones
Overall Construction:It's Nokia's best-made phone ever
 Some parts fit together larger gaps would expect, even cheap phone
 The old Nokia 1100, cheap featureless model, looked better-assembled this, even it's simple design
The battery cover doesn't fit perfectly
 When new, feels like used phone
 It doesn't snap firmly, doesn't fit tightly back phone
Buttons:The select key middle navigation pad kind stiff push, keys relatively easy
 Depending pushed, either difficult without bumping direction buttons tiring thumb
Just recently, 2 key started creaking sometimes
 It didn't new
Display View:The display looks brighter dark areas older color Nokia screens
 The 3100 pale-looking colors, visible even bright light
 This phone trades daylight visibility display looks "better," actually worse function
The "theme" included T-Mobile customized theme dark blue background behind screens
 It's really easy look at, especially display poorly sunlight
Completely Stupid Stuff:There option turn annoying startup sound, option turn shut-down sound (the official T-Mobile jingle)
 Unless switch silent mode first, can't turn phone make silent
 You look like idiot doesn't know use phone
There customizable shortcut menu, voicemail shortcut removed
 You unselect think gone, next time turn phone comes back
 Not incompetent programming, it's dumb voicemail option shortcut list all, like every phone planet already voicemail speed dial printed 1 key
 

I chose phone simply cheapest, made Nokia whose phones I've always great experience with---solid, reliable, intuitive great reception
I disappointed, phone delivers counts
 Thirty bucks shipped, direct T-Mobile Prepaid plus thirty five bucks air time credit, could ask for?Sure it's state art, doesn't bells whistles like MP3 player, camera, etc
---but COME ON folks, much REALLY need useless crap? Cell phone manufacturers cram fluff phones order reel suckers gadget geeks there
 Those us want simple reliable way make receive calls text messages, personal voicemail box, etc
 certainly don't
 Sheesh, I wanted listen music go I'd buy MP3 player I wanted take pics I'd buy cheap digital camera actually real lens usual lousy 
5-1
0 megapixel
I 3 semi-significant dislikes phone:1
 There doesn't seem way turn chime phone makes turning off, pain want turn cinema right movie starts, unfortunately
 This means switch "silent" fine unless you're already low battery
 Luckily battery life phone quite good shouldn't much issue
2
 There voice recorder
 I'd gladly feature instead gimmicky useless mono FM radio
 It's useful taking quick notes fly, shopping lists, etc
3
 There way assigning different ringtones different people phone book (Ringer ID) tell who's calling w/o look screen, even though phone offer Caller ID maybe 2 dozen different ringtones choose from
 And available ringtones terribly great, that's really trivial point
All 3 completely unnecessary inconveniences technological economic cost standpoint, I suspect Nokia saddled phone 3 disadvantages purpose, deliberate sales/marketing reasons
 Why? Because Nokia, like manufacturers things, obviously would prefer upsell higher-priced, course higher-PROFIT, models
 I suspect that's lot unflattering reviews entry-level models coming from, probably Nokia shills want steer consumers towards higher end models
 Either that, bunch flaming idiots honestly expect get high-end bells whistles bargain basement price
*** CORRECTION: #1


actually IS way turn power-down tone, it's manual reason
 All need hit Menu button twice, select "turn off" immediately---this silences completely turns off
 

I bought replace junky Motorola V180
 I use cell phone calls text messages alarm clock
My dropped calls gone zero
 Yeah, I know it's supposed network, phone better dropping calls Cingular
It took awhile figure make unique ringtones person -- unique ringtones group, first put person group
 I guess that's pretty useful I bunch people I like ignore, I able put group silent called
I don't like middle navigation key
 It hard push it's easy accidentally push ones
 I use middle key lot carrying phone purse means I need lock keys
 You use middle key lock keyboard
 

I got phone I needed one
 I wasn't particularly looking model price range time
 My last phone Motorola
 I Nokia's past I idea I ever left brand
 I found phone reliable love fact I receive radio it
 Whenever I walk somewhere etc I play radio still one ear listening happening elsewhere
 I found battery life amazing many times I misplaced charger long since I charge phone
 It doesn't camera however I didn't give 5 stars
 But like rarely use camera miss it
 I love fact tiny, compact light
 It great little phone
 

I purchased phone use cell-phone only
 I need fluff ( mp3, camera, etc )
 Along phone, I purchased Nokia made, belt-clip
The phone great
 It's battery life remarkable would never seem get low
 Everyone I talked impresssed good audio quality was
You notice one thing paragraph
 Everything discussed past tense
 I phone less one month
 The phone came belt-clip I driving rental car
 I still complete 2-part belt clip ( anyone want cheap belt clip ? ;-)Nokia, shame allowing bad design go public
I liked phone may buy another would recommend anyone desires good basic phone
 Just don't buy trust belt-clip
 

My friend got 6030 w/ Tmobile Prepaid
 I Nokia 6010 w/ Tmo Prepaid year
 His phone disappointing
 Construction flimsy: creaks squeaks anytime touch it
 The buttons tiny challenging manipulate
Worst - reception TERRIBLE
 When I call I frequently get voice mail
 His phone frequently get signal
 While could due location, I've held phone one hand, phone hand
 My phone acquires network without trouble; phone usually not
 He formerly Tracfone much better reception Nokia 1100
 I think 6030 may defective, I urge return different unit, doesn't receipt longer, he's worried trying
It's bad didn't sign still using 6010
 
































































































































































































































































This battery well worth getting
 The battery soooooooo much lighter batteries Nokia
 With real powerful battery, I go almost week starts say it's low
 This battery ever need
 Highly recomended
 

Purchased battery replace one came phone started function properly two years using phone
 This new battery significantly lighter much stand-by talk time battery came phone ever had
 If like Nokia 3390 can't justify buying new phone battery starting die (my situation), replacement HIGHLY recommended
 

If content phone, don't hastle purchasing new phone
 After 2 years regular use, original battery came 3390 shot
 I investigated new phone thought I would try battery less expensive solution
 Thus far spectacular
 It spends 2 evenings/week charger, apart 2 times/day original required
 Highly recommended
 

I bought battery trying several less expensive batteries another vendor hardly work all
 This battery last quite long new battery came phone last 3 days without recharging used lightly
 

The battery works well old Nokia 3390 lasts week (stand mode) I need recharge again
 I highly recommend battery
 

This seems excellent battery reasonable price
 I don't believe deal gets better this
 4 stars instead 5 I've owned long enough judge performance
 

This battery far charge battery came phone
 It may look slightly different putting rocks
 

item works fine
nokia batteries much one another
 so,they fairly interchangable
 

wow ths thng crazy love bought whle n turkey 8 bucks best nvestment made
 standby tme crazztyy lsten vocemail optons day long cuz frends talk wth hghly recommend 


































"the battery original seal & packaging
but stays less time old battery replacing first place
i'm really thinking putting old battery back" 

Advertise shows product seal retail package
 However, deliveried item not
 It small folding plastic bag
 













Battery didn't seem hold charge long
 Decided buy mom new phone I want do
 Her memory going I wasn't sure could learn use different cell phone
 

I ordered item received timely manner
 It works like supposed customer happy
 

Ordered two
 One worked fine
 The didn't work all
 It didn't seem worth send back
 Besides, I keep hoping wife get rid antique phone
 Having two working batteries encourages keep it
 

I rate product highly
 It exactly I got described ad works well
Thank Amazon
 

I received battery timely manner issue delivery
 However, wasn't new didn't work 


 simple that
 Low price means I can't bothered send back
 





































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































This product advertised 1500 mAh battery
 It not
 The ad copy wrong
 It fact 1050 mAh battery
 I don't know still haven't corrected this
 The corresponding stand time talk time greatly reduced ad says might expect reduced mAh rating
 It however vibrating feature originally listed
 




















The headset advertised easy use, I figured out
 I'm guessing, save money, Plantronics include written instructions box
 The illustrations back box aren't clearest easiest understand
 







When I cracked cover two-year-old 6560, nearly impossible find replacement locally, ones "close" fits came ridiculous designs really properly fit
 This tough product find - even available Nokia website
 This replacement cover fits 6560 perfectly, exact replacement right "Nokia" name cover
 Now phone looks brand new
 I live West Virginia, TDMA still available GSM
 The 6560 smallest TDMA phone made, I don't plan give time soon
 I probably buy another covers I replace phone
 
























































































































































































































I purchased phone gift wife, wanted "flip phone", didn't want learn use Motorola (she's Nokia past years)
 This really great phone - full functionality expect high end Nokia phones (e
g
 syncronizes Outlook Microsoft Office products); easy navigate around cameras, MP3 video PTT, everything could possibly want
 The downsides (a) keyboard little hard get used - couple weeks even becomes less hassle; (b) camera good outside shots, good inside poor light - another reviewer said, buy camera want good quality shots
 For spontaneous snap shots video (e
g
 kids playing park), it's fine
 4 Stars phone - 5 stars you're Nokia user looking flip phone
 

At time, expensive phone I ever purchased
 I fell love design color phone worked great, especially overseas
 However, silver colored plastic face phone started peeling (from contact skin oils, perspiration, etc
) owning 6 months so
 I researched people contacted Nokia got replacement phones exact thing within months
 I loyal Nokia customer 10 years (my first phone circa 1997 Nokia)
 Needless say, I longer Nokia customer
 

I like phone I've bought far
 It looks really cool easy handle
 The sound images beautiful
 

I would rather give product "Zero" star
 It looks good picture, receive hand, understand I talking about
 The battery cover extreme difficult remove phone
For phone marked $400+, worth all
 The phone keeps unresponding could power off
 The way rest phone removed battery
 The N76 I got really piece junk
I bought phone wife birthday
 After hours phone
 She wants return product back Amazon ASAP
 Don't waste time money good looking phone
 

This product finally shipped several delays, I finally got it, box opened phone damaged sides
 It plastic cover memory card, didn't need it, since didn't bring included memory card neither
 The charger also missing
My choice send back (and pay 2-way shipment) living "new" cellphone looked like roughly used year
At first I though box opened way here, unless someone FedEx put really mistreated cellphone (identical one bought) place new one, I doubt could accidentally (or even purpose) damaged way
Since shipment country waaaaay expensive I keep it, don't let happen you
 DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER


 




































































































































I bought fun shell months ago
 It looked attractive interesting - must number 1 company
 It arrived, took long arrive excitement high I ordering it
 It took time install in, nails doomed broken
 Anyways, worked fine
 At least, worked way supposed work
 And now, I dislike:1
 It practical
 You use night, people ages 9-15 make typed in
2
 After installed phone able use protective case
3
 The phone becomes larger, thicker, much heavier, least weight doubles
But apart problems, mobile look special fancy other, simple Nokia 3220
Oh end? I went skiing, take I wanted put protective case on
 I came back month ago still wish put back
 So accessory 50$ sitting box, waiting dark
 




























I used one week I returned Nokia 6822 (see review)
 The case little small I found always pushing I could see top screen also camera lens
 It fit ok, I probably would put it
 


















































Making Flip phones isnt really Nokias forte
 The reason started making flips cuz Motorola, RAZR line flips making big process gaining lost market share




Anyway

none Nokias flip phones really made impact,but N75 changed that

It's part Nokia's latest line cell phones N-series
 N-series phones probably one well equiped multimedia phones

though prefer sony ericsson's multimedia capabilites anyday
There seems problem Amazons batch N75s


i get phone replaced twice

the 3rd one seems work great

Amazon kind enough bare cost shipping phones back special mention customer care dept


"you guys great job"Oh forgot

the review

Well phone great keypad

and internal screen simply amazing


colors vibrant screen resolution right
Some themes available phone look fantastic

look Transformers theme

It dedicated keys side camera neat set keys outside control music player without open phone
The music player probably one best ones around
 Comes complete visualizations graphic equilizers displays album art too
sound quality great would great Nokia supplied set ear phones phone
 Its sadly missing one cant plug regular ear phone, cuz reason nokia decided change ear phone jack

The 2MP camera takes good pictures day, flash pictures come grainy colors seem washed out


you cant expect cell phone camera


The OS one Nokia's greatest assets

it retained Symbian OS platform continues deliver ease use everyone comes expect Nokia
Battery life decent could better
To sum it's great flip phone amazed less wieghs
 And Amazon seems got fresh batch N75s problems ever


 












Its "Replaces Nokia BL-5F" "Product Features" say
 It "BL-6C" "Product Details, Item model number: CLKBL6C" state
I ended BL-6C fit N95
 Customer support argued I wrong ordering product even I pointed incongruences product page, I send battery back could refund me
Since I live Buenos Aires price shipping back battery said take care that, I go directly Amazon solution
 The credited card soon enough
 Great Amazon customer service
Horrible Seller customer service
 They didn't even corrected page
Stay away them
 






















































I say, people would joke case, makes already large phone (by todays standard) look alot larger
 But protect phone, yes, I laugh back face everytime phones would break
 We actully started calling phone "The Tank" "Iron Phone" things like that
 

This horrible product, horrible customer service seller


 avoid like plague
 


















This phone recognize MicroSD card larger 2GB
 I updated latest firmware software phone still glitchy
 All adapters proprietary
 I bought phone listen MP3s really good that
 I paid $300 I would say worth $30
 All make phone calls send text messages
 This phone step up
 

Muy buen celular, lo compre para usarlo en Colombia y tenido ningun problema
Lo recomiendo
 

I could hear person I calling fine, everything I said static-y
 You could hear every little movement I adjusted phone all
 

Just received week
 Replacing Nokia N90 model, photos much better (both optical Carl Zeiss lenses, 3
2 mp vs
 2
0 N90)
 Also, N73 covers radio bands, making reception Cingular coverage strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae)
 The N90 lacked one frequency ranges used Cingular, depending city I in, I occasionally spotty coverage
 The Symbian operating system N73 faster older version N90, best all, much compact N90, fits nicely palm hand jeans pocket
 Last, smooth operating lense cover back phone, protecting camera lense (why aren't like this?)
 As usual, flash isn't equivalent even moderate digital camera, otherwise I see phone best worlds
 

For $10 more, upgrade N80 w/ uPNP, video calling, WiFi, bar code reader, MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Safari browser, higher resolution screen 

This really cool phone many features
 Unfortunately, could use features U
S
 One thing I understand unlocked phones expensive US retailers charge much price
 Its price 429
99 Nokia's web page
The phone gets 5 stars retailer's price gets -2 stars
 

beautiful phone great camera easy use web browser
 really impressed sound quality
 note get cheaper [


] (or elsewhere)
 

I came N73 looking flee crashy performance T-Mobile Dash, answered hopes dreams
 The N73 stable, rock solid, occasion slow, every you'll find damning Espoo-dwellers designed including Pop-Port (instead mini-USB), miniSD (instead microSD), US 3G (yes, title says 3G, later), WiFi
 But let's break down
 (Forewarning: I say T-Mo Dash, I'm using AT&T
; Yes, I unlocked Dash, don't bother asking anything relating T-Mo)
The camera awesome
 Yes, it's 3
2 MPixels, it's low-light performance OK (it gets bit noisy, I've seen Nikon's noisier pictures)
 The LED flash useful think, Carl Zeiss lenses fantastic, really steals show auto-focus
 This means you'll able make sure pictures in-focus, even macro focus'd (which land decent, understated, depth field)
 On bad side, there's optical zoom (so you'll never real depth field), flash good, it's godly, NO WAY AT ALL turn artificial shutter sound (so incognito ever), front facing camera AMAZINGLY bad low-light (you need sunlight clear picture), built-in geotagging (an app available Nokia, however)
 Other that, it's one best cameras I've ever used phone
Reception Godly
 I'll get great reception places phones scratch heads
 Just warning everyone US: THIS PHONE DOES NOT HAVE 3G YOU CAN USE
 The original N73 (-1, -2, -3 -4, models RM-133) 3G using 2100 MHz band, useful Europe
 The phone sold here, N73-5 (RM-132) feature removed
 What means: No 3G US, 3G Europe either
 And bring T-Mobile's use 2100 MHz band 3G network US: use AWS, requires use signal 2100 MHz band 1700 MHz band
 The N73-5 supports neither, earlier N73s support 2100 MHz
 No love there
 However, magic wonderfully optimized technology, EDGE radio N73 seems faster T-Mo Dash
 The web browser faster, sending e-mails seems faster, hell, I even pull Internet Radio broadcast live Qik (though LOT delays involved use Qik, you're buying phone that, I suggest another phone)
S60's great OS, it's got flaws
 For one, e-mail client downright simple
 And that's bad
 No support HTML messages (you'll see tags), in-line images no-no, NO way change size text (so everything big letters), hit send button, wait message sent pen another (well, cancel, either way: watch progress bar send e-mail)
 On plus side, easily switch applications S60 (just hold Application button, press bring Apps menu), seems stupid I can't read e-mails one sent background
 WM5 6 this
 Also, mail client ever download headers, never message contents
 What means you: need wait message download read it
 On plus side, select several messages phone download (Hold pencil key click messages want select)
 Same goes marking messages read
On upside, S60's IMAP support wonderful: means Push E-mail without needing Exchange account (Push GMail anyone?), ability subscribe folders choice
S60, like BlackBerry OS Windows Mobile, special hardware keys
 In case, S60 Pencil key, Apps key, Multimedia Key, C key
 The Pencil key things input related (like switching predictive text modes, different languages), hold it, select text copying pasting (WM6 iPhone can't that), yes: C/P works ALL applications
 The Apps key used switching running apps (hold button) choosing app run (press it)
 By default, apps quit hit hang-up button (much simpler WM6)
 The Multimedia Key basically another four shortcuts access, even aren't multimedia related
 The C key universal delete button (not universal "back" button like WM6 BBOS), whatever highlighted DELETED, keep mind
 I bring knowing appropriately use buttons elevated S60 smartphone phone fancy UI true smartphone, allows take full advantage device (C/P SOOOOOOOOOO useful finally make use it, including copying pasting phone numbers phonebook entry text message somebody)
Other advantages S60 include it's compatability various devices (bluetooth GPS devices work flawlessly, every time
 WM6 can't say that
 It also works Bluetooth keyboards, iPhone can't do), it's damn stable (you may occasion reboot it, it's fast easy deal it's hardly worth mentioning), phenominal battery life (admittedly, apps like Qik really take phone, listen Internet Radio day still power left evening), easy use UI (it's prettiest, people won't "I don't know work phone"), Mac compatibility (out-of-the-box syncing support iSync, Nokia Media Transfer makes manipulating files phone easy, including syncing pictures, videos, music installing apps)
 Granted: 90% apps working phone Windows, everything *need* Mac OS, Nokia developing apps Mac OS, evidenced recent release Nokia Maps Loader (which allows download maps load onto phone, choice either downloading entire country, states)
 Definately consider getting Bluetooth GPS unit, you'll able use Nokia Maps (It doesn't awesome text-to-speech features good N&uuml;vi, gets job done
 The Maps application maps free, fee use navigation feature, though competitive relative GPS fees cell carriers), geotag photos, geocache (Geocache Navigator says it's N95 app, runs fine N73, doesn't even complain), even keep tabs walks, runs, biking stats Sports Tracker (very cool application, free, I mention that?)
I'd give N73 five stars wasn't lack WiFi (which would make EDGE), it's poor e-mail client, it's rather small amount RAM (you'll hit RAM wall upgrade firmware use browser lot), fact Nokia never seemed think numerical shortcuts menus would good thing
 At point, spend extra dollars grab N82 N95 can
 They updated version OS, WiFi GPS, much useful could imagine point (plus many apps work new OS)
 

Positives:Great screen display (its best feature I bought it)Intuitive easily customizable software applications (when functional - see below)Clear audio sound great/loud speaker systemVery compact good looking overallDecent battery lifeNegatives:Keypad could biggerCamera (for pay high price premium) adds years faces (but ok still objects); there's delay image capturing (i
e
 see captured may end ultimately gets saved photo)Software glitches (i
e
 attempting set alarm clock would trigger system error - problem fixed performing factory settings reset)Weaker signal capturing abilities old Nokia 

I decided get phone multi-function camera, media player, one could use e-mail, browsing Internet viewing office documents phone this, expense speed
 The response time phone quite disappointing
The keyboard pad small hands :-) Oh there's occasional freezing phone together


The camera quality quite good preset modes adjust picture settings
Radio coverage wonderful well, screen display quite clear battery life also satisfactory
The phone worth money (it's feature filled) one exception lacks wi-fi
 If willing sacrifice speed features get it, however speed main requirement making decision purchase, look elsewhere
 

First, let apologize seller (TigerDirect), I removed feedback mistake
 The item promptly shipped arrived perfect condition
Second, I love phone
 I still trying familiarize features
 It awhile since I used Nokia phone (I've using Sony Ericsson past 2 years) I sometimes press wrong button
 

I needed phone hurry Amazon came thru

This excellent phone*Great big ultra definition screen*Great camera*great signal*No drop calls*Full internetbrowser opera miniA++++ 

purchased phone Hong Kong, white oneno matter good review I read, price drawback, random crash issuebut one latest 4
x firmware, pretty good stable I thinkreception: typical nokia, I see it's little better 6120, K790a 1800 part (using Hong Kong)voice: amazing, stable even 1 barbattery: it's par K790a, battery claimed kinda conservativescreen: bigger K790a, bigger screen eye candy, fonts easy read like 176x220cam: it's good, slow startup, tested phone before, found blue-purple tint, one I purchased alot better, alot less blue tint, fixed adjusting white balance; video capture alot better K790abt: it's many function K790a, it's FAST, get 1
2Mbps file transferhowever, 4
x firmware a2dp added, works included players, crashing problem realplayerremedy: disconnect stereo headset open realplayer, connect back player starts playing, every time phone restartsfunctionality: smartphone, good platform add 3rd party appsconclusion: current price phone simply steal now, used $500-600 range, get chanceI give 96/100improvement needs done: bt a2dp application coverage, cam startup, SD-HC support 

I browsing around Amazon encounter Nokia N73
 This phone used way back 2007 Okinawa Japan service Softbank
 All say description accurate battery life far superior compare 3G cell phones time yeah mention use video calling lot ( video crystal clear way) video call call "FACE TIME" introduced late 2010 US
 Im saying awhile advance asian counter part
too bad left phone honco (taxi) ride back home 2008
 

The N73 it's good cellphone , good camera, flash , it's quite bit slower N series cellphones , main menu appears slow , sometimes need restarted work fine
I listening music suddendly phone hangs maintained extrange sound , action caused remove battery , wait 5 minutes N73 comes back live (maybe needs Nokia firmware update) 

I bought phone Nokia N82
 If I $$$ spare I would bought N82
 However I use wi fi GPS I chose N73
 I dissapointed all


 This EXCELLENT phone, I took 4 hr flight breeze
 I listened MP3, watched music videos MP4 Real Player, I played Roger Federer tennis, Need 4 Speed, Soduku, etc, read section book reviwed Excel PDF files I downloaded
 The camera pictures awesome phone
 For reason come bluish cast I fix easily Photosohop (I fix SLR pictures well big deal)
 The FM radio handy I keep meetings Lotus Notes synchronization
 Plus, less $300 I worried carrying phone pocket times
As I said like $$$ I recommend Nokia N82 doesnt mean N73 outdated underpowered less features N82 big deal
 

I happy performance phone I think one best Nokia
 

I love camera, great pic quality, cover lens doesn't get scratched, flash good
 The one thing bothered first phone keyboard
 The keys kinda small, hard use someone big fingers
 But I don't regret getting phone, happy it
 

Hey Love phone
 The image quality excellent
 It almost anything
 Even works almost every software put it
 The audio quality also exceptional
 Only problem support video format
 But wouldn't trade N95 even though WiFi 

This first unlocked phone I say, I'm satisfied phone would definitely recommend it
 I bought sale I feel worth price (best NO contract extension
)
 The camera (love two phone) music player fabulous
 It's user friendly lot features require reading book
Although I love phone, drawbacks, slows times multiple programs open (but phone doesn't), I would like repeating alarm, I use phone alarm almost daily
 And lastly I find keys little small side
 

I researched phones months deciding Nokia N73
 My goal combine phone, mp3 player, camera one device
 The N73 delivers three: excellent phone smartphone capabilities (office viewer, full internet, etc) great sounding music player FM radio, amazing camera flash
 Combined mid-range price tag N73 bests nearly every phone class
 If ultimate goal one device media needs, N73 list
 And Amazon (through TigerDirect) best prices Nokia N Series available
 If extra $$ N95 edge, N73 lacks Wifi costs nearly half much
 And compared iPhone N73 (and rest N series) similar better feature set less cost
 I highly recommend phone
 

2 years using n-gage qd finally broke needed better phone replacement, friend n-70 n blown away it, researched nokia n-series, really wanted buy n-95 change mind since way much bought n-73
 day, nice phone, good call quality, nice camera n yeh takes good pics 3 megapixel, speaker pretty good too, sound sony walkman, well like symbian operating system problems too, earlier couldn't send text message reinstal firmware n viola works well actually wasnt easy experiment anyways good phone price
pros:-camera (nice picture quality)-call quality (crystal clear)-speaker (good, sound sony walkman)-light sensor-build quality good-most likely customizable-battery lifecons-numeric keys small n spaces between-sometimes bit slow especially sendin text messages, n-gage qd send text messages faster-no wifi 

This nice cellphone


 I loaded 1GIG card
 Do math


 20-30% song capacity converted ATRAC coding
 GPRS 850 im from
 Has special program clears calls, basically speaking regular phone line
 Picture video editing phone, 30fps video, 3
2 mega pix cam


 yep clear

And oh yes


 100 BASS 100 TREBLE thing
Drawbacks:Slow operative system
 s60 guess
 Dont take video picture dark places

 see nothing
 Dont reduce bouncing videos, youll see slow frames per sec
Dont drop it


 fragile
 






This earpiece decent say least
 I would given least 4 stars earpiece would better quality
 Maybe ears aren't large enough


 no, customer always right earpiece faulty
 It would slide place resulting constantly adjusting ear
 The sound quality great phone nearby


 phone 2-2
5 feet away static kicks big time
 The good thing person line doesn't notive deterioration approxmately 5 feet
 I would walk bathroom


 ajoined room



 would connection full static
 As I said headset would received least one star earpiece practical


 I live poor performance taking distance consideration
 

I bought black one $40, year, I would purchase another one
Cons: 1
 When I push earpiece ear, I end clicking activation key, either disconnect call, expects voice dial
2
 After I used couple weeks, slides ear way easily
 And don't let over-the-ear hook fool either - it's that
3
 The earpiece goes ear little big I normal size ears
4
 It bells whistles would expect get price unit
Pros: It sound quality would expect Nokia
Given Cons Pros, I would purchase unit recommend anyone
 It's pain butt
 
















































Works well I bought another vehicle
 Not problems whatsoever
 

I used phone charger phone 5 times broke tip goes charging spot car
 The charging spot lighter spot
 It separate charging unit
 I disappointed
 

A good buy price, charger fits perfectly car
 Charges efficiently charger's wire length adjusted 
 

Like almost chargers, works fine
 Nothing special, works past year 2
 

While cord recoils well touch button, charger difficult insert & remove car's port
 It almost seems large adequate fit
 Works okay finally coupled
 

Product arrived good shape arrived early

 I certainly going buy stuff them
 

Retractables take less space among head phone wires, chargers, name junk console van seats
 


































































The Good:* stores tons music card give phone, love way set easy use music player; even equilizer inside mess with
 Sounds great playing music, especially stereo headsets, phone sounds good playing music too
*is fast
 It reacts faster phone I ever had
 I push button whatever I want open I'm there
*using modem home computer, able ditch DSL bill always faster dial far time I get on
 Truth is, connects different speeds I problems slow
*The camera great
 It fuzzy pic someone moving around, everything still, take nice picture
*The speaker phone best I've ever used
 I walk little ways away heard hear, awesome
*nice design look wise everything
*overall pleased everything phone except:The Bad:*shorter battery life says have
 I thought battery, got new one, wasn't battery
 I thought phone sucking dry, turned phone in, got replacement bleeds battery whether using music player one day usually
 If makes next day, needs charged around lunch time
 I don't like that
 No isn't modem usage, problem ever trying modem out
* battery cover hard get off
 ahh frustrating
 Makes feel like you're going rip phone half start get on, starts ease up
The Ugly:* uglyso I love phone except battery life it
 But I never found one phone every single thing perfect I love except iphone whoa that's pricey now
 So I stick one now
 

This best phone ever made
 It worst phone ever made
It average nearly every regard
 My faults phone are:The slide mechanism isn't smooth
It's triband: 1900/850/1800 means next useless lot places outside country
Favorite features:1gb memory standard
 This highest memory sold major carrier phone released
Easy music camera controls
 

While looking new phone, I surprised reviews I found phones I interested in
 I decided search reviews phone I already see people said see usual complaints many phones
 Turns maybe people overreacting things possibly need treat phones better
I've phone years it's always done fine
 I love music player I never needed buy iPod; though, love music, get iPod
 This phone won't you
 Still, phone's good casual listening, I love I move music computer straight phone USB cord came with
 You can't really sort music though, need real organization, phone you
As battery life, phone lasts least four days I need charge it
 I rarely let go long, often I let go couple days I'm boyfriend's away charger
 I talk lot listen music lot too, always texting
 The battery never issue
The screen could get scratched
 Mine still looks fine years, hideous scratches
 I've dropped many times (as I many things) phone still fine
 I even dropped cream cheese frosting thank goodness lasted that
 Maybe I lucked never hit screen


though two years, that's really luck--that's like miracle
The phone quiet, doesn't bother me
 At parents I go quieter room I'm somewhere, like store, I problems
 I wish I could hear better car
 On highway, tires get loud
 People always hear fine
 Though recently phone started echoing I saying I think that's frosting I dropped in
 It echoes me, person I'm talking to
The camera pretty bad
 I don't use camera much, I like easy move pictures I take computer
 If want camera phone, don't buy phone
 It's like phone happens little camera--not really camera phone
Texting good
 It's like phone
 The phone holds lot texts, 2200+ starts act weird mess music player
 One time I crazy amount texts piled started interfering phone's ability read music
 It kept telling wrong artists song titles--I thought broke
 But I cleared messages everything good again
If you're picky, phone good
 If want phone wow perfect amazing things, get something else (it'll hard find something good)
 

I got phone part bargain joined Tmobile
 It features wanted phone: good camera,music player,FM radio nice design
 The phone reached expectations thus far, i've 18 months i've dropped countless times,yet i've time pick works like well; maintains ruggedness expect Nokia phone
 The voice command option extremely disappointing never understood tried using it
 The back may hard open don't see problem since don't need open time
 The radio really impressive well good reception time
 The phone lot memory space
 Cell phone reception clear serves purpose communication device
 The 1GB memory card huge plus storage
 Data transfer easy quick
 Its easy make changes settings receive messages soon get sent
 The functions phone easy understand use
 Unfortunately, headphones come phone last long become useless- least case
In conclusion, pretty good cellphone don't expect world it
 It comes good price would totally recommend friend
 Even year, still major issues phone
 

I thought I liked phone lot I got brand new T-mobile
 Then dropped CARPET apartment, dining room table (a short distance) screen went black
 I used 3 days
 T-mobile refund replace phone


 

I faithful Nokia customer, worst phone I ever owned
 I've phone year, nothing trouble it
 I think I may gotten "lemon" even so, text message set phone really user friendly
 You go menus previous (and older) Nokias send text message, even using "shortcuts
" And rarely remembers spellings I save phone, I constantly retype friend's names, words I use time
 I tried using music player required using questionable software, installing computer, I want do
 The songs came preloaded phone go random


 The music starts playing
 After one year, phone ring consistently
 Sometimes lights I call, gives garbled ring
 It zero water damage, it's crappy phone
 It also came ring tones, seems strange considering fairly expensive last year
 I would never buy phone recommend someone else
 Bummer
 

I phone ten months within first hours screen already scratch putting pocket
 The phone also crappy battery friends phone say batteries don't hold power well either
 The buttons front sides phone great either
 All buttons front point either got stuck haven't worked
 On friends' phones, many buttons fall off
 The music player phone okay
 The phone also problem password security section even first got would let set password make password protected
 A good thing phone fall flight stairs still work before
 Oh, yeah back difficult take time goes gets even difficult
 

For first three months I phone, everything fine
 But three months, volume completely died
 The alarm, ring, music player, everything
 Now sound works sometimes (it took three weeks start working totally random, nothing I did), it's on
 Sometimes it's quiet, sometimes goes it's ringing, sometimes normal, sometimes dead
 And it's frustrating external ringing volume control, although holding pound key switch silent normal
 Another problem I could get voice activated controls work
 I'm sure do, I couldn't figure out, I've never trouble using voice activated controls phone I've had
 Another problem I've sometimes even I signal, call end reason
 Granted sometimes I accidentally hit end call button, course problem phone, sometimes honestly reason it
 Also, pretty short battery life, bothers I recommend Motorola tend long battery life (although warned, experience Motorola phones tend freeze also typically signal quality phones)
 Another problem I've recently phone games phone stopped functioning properly
 Also, phone doesn't much memory I would like, disappointing
 But fortunately micro SD card slot, mine came card already it
 Finally, phone background, whenever I try use picture I took wallpaper, doesn't show "full screen" phone calls right side up
 If there's way it, I haven't found it
The pluses external controls music player radio nice, although it'd nice didn't plug headphones listen radio
 The stereo headset came phone nice too
 The buttons easy use, I like using phone texting
But weigh pros cons, isn't right phone
 I've phone 8 1/2 months now, I'm looking new one
 I usually try keep phones year least, one
 I using "back phone" half time 3 months owning phone, I recently gave back phone sister
 It's definitely time new one
 

Bought one wife contract renewal
 We loyal customers carrier since 1999
 Very first month phone starting act up
 T-mobile renewed it
 The second phone better either
The phone's music features much better one designed for: talking phone
 What disappointment


 

Okay, dont get wrong phone okay since music player end day phone sucks









 The reason I got becuase cheap renew contract T-mobile
 It worth it
 You cant listen radio unless EXACT headphones T-moblie gives you, otherwise plug stupid audio converter device
 The camera takes pics look like developed 1974
 And stupid thing locks buttons every 5 minutes
 I unlock open phone every time want look something
 

I say one better phones Tmobile offers
 It holds well every day use, battery good, music headphones amazing camera bad phone
 As person ridiculous comments bad exploded????? Whatever
 

No IPOD, works fine phone, durable
 Music player good enough, software Nokia doesn't always cooperate
 

I want say great phone part it's pretty good looks like consumers fairly pleased phone
 However, I first got phone, I wasn't fully pleased it
 The sound reception great
 Music easy upload
 Texting easy use sent flash
 Talk time standby horrible
 It seemed liked awesome features battery wasn't able keep all
 Playing games, taking picures listening music ran battery fast
 Even I barely used phone, battery would get low
 I thought phone would nice bus ride work, I knew I listened music way there, I wouldn't much talk time left case emergency
 I could've faulty battery


who knows
 The shape style awesome however, phone didn't seem durable silver plastic piece ear would go starting peel I phone 2 weeks
 The slider feature pretty cool although first slider phone easy hang people you're chatting multi-tasking
 I ended trading phone Samsung Blast buyers remorse up
 I'm happy Samsung Blast, I love Nokias
 If wasn't horrible battery life, I would've stuck phone


 

I've phone 4 months now
 At first I loved it, first week, I started find glitches
 I use calls listening music
 Here's what's wrong now:1
 After first week, noticed would restart middle phone calls, effectively dropping phone call
2
 During first month, started interrupting songs waiting voice commands - I never pushed buttons I don't know this
3
 Last month stopped recognizing headphones plugged in
 Now play music speakers
4
 Today started working speakerphone
 I couldn't turn speakerphone private conversation
 Restarted phone, seems back normal
I thought maybe I happened unlucky one bad phone, saw reviews realized maybe isn't good phone: [


] 

This phone many damn features difficult use
 I wanted mp3 player radio features
 Well, I 3 hours trying configure music phone
 I able put correct folder
 Apparently music supposed go "my music" folder
 There also "music" folder
 CONFUSING


 And "shortcut keys" play music, side phone, don't seem working either
 Also, it' hard open back put batter sim card, especially don't nails
 Right now, thing I like phone slide feature
 There many features, different names feature forget menu look for
 I've never hard time electronics life
 This first me, able use something like this
 I usually never even open manual
 So far, phone done nothing give headache make late previous engagement
 I'm frustrated it
 

The Had 2 phones
 The first one I bought, second one replacement insurance
 Both phones cracked screen within two months use everyday
 If buy phone, expect cracked screen accidentally drop onto hard surface 6 inches more
 

The phone felt fragile
 Not good
 It looks better picture feels platic like real
Returned it, Amazon handled return fairly well
 

yes, it's tie Sony Cybershot K790a best multimedia phone far market (at least iPhone show up, game again)
 still contemplating whether renew tmobile contract 2 years get phone $100 drop previous one get new contract


updated september'07: I purchased phone little month ago think it's great
 it's wanted phone, except things i'll mention here
 mp3 player responsive comprehensive supports playlists, ton settings shuffle/repeat options
+ processor extraordinarily fast compared anything Motorola (including wife's RIZR)
+ nokia PC suite (free Nokia
com) convert music/video format phone, surprised movie quality
+ bluetooth connection fast better quality motorola+ dedicated keys useful don't need open mp3 player application play current list
 however need exert little much pressure taste (but prevents accidentally changing/starting/stopping songs pocket)- still miss razr's thickness- screen scratches pretty fast (again compared RAZR family), make sure put screen protector
- REALLY dissapointing thing battery life, way average Nokia (i charge every day often)
 

I bought phone super cheap contract extension, nice set features
 Unfortunately, I ready send back moments taking box
 The first problem I back hard open
 I'm pretty sure latch mechanism fail eventually
 Then, within five minutes removing plastic screen, screen deep scratch it
 I don't know happened - I fiddling around hands
 Other back cover, phone strikes fairly solid, slider seems sturdy enough
The music player seems work fine - haven't problems it
 It sounds terrible coming speaker, cheap $10 pair headphones, music sounds quite nice
 I impressed sound quality
 I haven't problems kind hissing sounds using adapter
The Nokia software easy use - problems transferring files anything like that
The FM radio also appealed me, works ok
 I've read review said radio works headphones, that's really accurate
 The headphones need plugged phone function antenna, plug in, choose sound come phone's speaker
Most aspects phone's interface straightforward intuitive, I don't really rants raves there
 Like every reviewer, I shocked short battery life
 Sometimes I've even charge phone day charged night
 Oh - annoying thing - maybe helpful reader clue one - I plug phone charge it, screen backlight turns stays duration charge
 I can't figure turn off
The screen quality (other tendency scratch) excellent
 Very bright, easy read, nice color
 But I'd agree earlier reviewer said clock small
 I don't wear watch depend phone keep time
Other button back cover, buttons fine
 The power button side buttons harder manage I'd like, they're terrible
 The keypad great buttons easy use accurately
As reviewers mentioned, voice recognition function useless
 It never understood anything I've ever said it
 I PEBL UK understands British English, phone still understands time
 (They use speaker-independent system don't record voice tags train phone
)The camera ok, I'd never use place regular digital camera
 The pictures aren't good
 After taking picture, phone prompts save send picture, annoying, push camera button again, go back taking pictures save last picture taken default location
I don't text use web phone, I can't say much that
 I found software uses guessing words type quite good Motorola phones I've used past
Where phone disappointing function phone
 I surprised this, Nokia good reputation, Motorola supposedly good - I found reverse true case
 I've lot reception problems phone
 With PEBL, rare kind problem dropped calls bad reception, ongoing issue phone
 I've also issues phone ringing someone calls - get voicemail leave message, I check voicemail, message isn't there
 This happened three times three weeks I used phone (and I don't get lot calls, three significant percentage)
 Even reception seemed good, I still told voice sounded little fuzzy
 When I switched back using PEBL, friends heard difference immediately
 My home office closet partly underground, I rarely problems PEBL there, Nokia useless room
 The PEBL also works better bluetooth headset
So phone bad enough I stopped using went back PEBL, far superior device (though perfect means
) Still, Nokia bargain (especially 1GB card) many functions it's nice around
 My daughter uses mp3 player, radio, camera
 

I've new Nokia 5300 week I love it
 I new fancy cell phone stuff, last one I bare bones basic
 It great phone much with
 The camera handy since I never remember take camera anywhere mp3 player radio also great have
 The music aspects phone really sold it, I looking seperate mp3 players awhile hadn't made mind I saw phone awesome deal was
 You can't beat one cent phone free shipping $75
00 rebates
 T-Mobile old Net10 phone number ported new phone 2 days
 The customer service people nice ability buy ringtones, wall paper myfaves icons right phone T-Zones awesome
 I also like check bill minutes used account & plan info right phone
 I impressed
 The issue I finding accessories it-my usual discount accessory shops don't much yet-I'm assuming phone new, I'm sure get resolved soon
 Buy phone, great
 

I upgraded Nokia 5300 XpressMusic three years service TMobile Motorola V300
 Comparing Nokia 5300 Motorola I noticed one huge difference right box: Nokia made lightweight plasic
 This wasn't much issue I went change SIM card Motorola put Nokia
 While I didn't break back cover Nokia, fear throughout process
 It's thin cover since relatively cheap, I think I'll buy extra one hand case
 I think case Nokia bit delicate side, may want consider hard pastic cover (as sold Amazon Bargain Cell)
A somewhat quirky design issue ON/OFF button
 Not clearly identified documentation, took awhile find it
 (It's top phone near USB power inlets
) It's flush phone although fingers small, tough depress it
 I use nail end pencil get work
 Hold two seconds give option 'Off' several profiles 'normal', 'outdoor', etc
 I guess don't turn phone off, keep standby, it's big deal
Now good stuff, much brag phone
 The camera: takes great shots, easily uploads computer printing, fabulous zoom, YES there's video phone
The music player big seller one, doesn't disappoint
 The 1GB card comes shipped (installed) enough right now, I tell I'll upgrading 2GB card (about $24 sale


) soon
 Connecting PC included USB cord simple XP, things pretty much recognized synched without problem
 If you've navigated cell phone menu used PC before, shouldn't problem you
 Exporting video, images music PC Nokia quick easy
Another fun function you've uploaded tunes, set specific functions phone incoming call ring
 Easy change fun
The main reason phone: making receiving calls
 The Nokia seems good antenna calls spotty Motorola, Nokia flawless reception
 Volume control side handy, bluetooth speakerphone, although I've yet try them
Getting earpiece right hear caller may take practice, find sweet spot, calls clear recipients say call quality end excellent
A calendar, alarm, games (poker


one favorites), easy find use too
The display clear, bright LARGE
 Beautiful screen
 The size phone thin RAZR, since I'm used V300, it's pretty much size bit lighter weight
The slide phone smooth, since I'm new design I comparison
 I hope holds well flip design, I would imagine depends upon me
 "Gently" would key word using phone
A rubberized grip (the color) side back phone
 Volume control, fwd, rwd, pause, play camera buttons side camera lens back phone
This fun phone many options
 It 'free' 2yr contract re-up TMobile
com, SIM card go back V300 reason durability issue road
 I think long careful Nokia 5300 XpressMusic phone, keep smiling time come
 

I got phone upgrade renewing contract t-mobile, since I tired motorola razr v3 fact everyone it, I decided get something lot people have, chose Nokia 5300 lilac
 I've owed 4 nokia phones past pleased them, I can't say different phone
 For starters I fell love phones unique slider design color
 It good quality, bright color screen, careful screen scratch easily, I recommend screen protector
 As phone it's good, calls sound clear, noise distortion
 This phone many features, containing Mp3 player basically phones main attraction, excellent bluetooth, 1
3 Megapixel camera, FM Radio, Web Browser, speakerphone, Video recorder/playback, infrared, etc
 It comes wall charger, 1 GB memory card (you upgrade 2 GB), USB Cable, Headphones talk with, listen FM Radio, listen Mp3's, course also put music loudspeaker, gives good, clear sound
 You also set Mp3's ringtone, need buy ringtones, I liked toggle keys side phone used mp3 player, volume, camera
 The con's phone good battery life, past nokia phones excellent battery life, since I'm guessing contains mp3 player phones battery life shorter, I also didn't like fact phone 5MB internal memory, least memory card back up
 Overall phone great, I'm truly pleased purchase
 

I bought phone upon deciding switch T-mobile Verizon
 I wanted phone user friendly music player I wasn't required purchase individual songs I didn't want to
 I able use player without purchase additional software computer
 It compatible Windows Media well Yahoo Music(which also purchase subscription to
) It faves phone, also big plus
 It also IM enabled
If messaging, nice features
 It capable taking video voice message clips
 The camera nice also, large screen
 You type message phone predict word typing, don't punch button 2 three times
 Just type word phone guess word want
The phone blue tooth enabled comes usb cord, ear plugs adaptor piece
 There many features I don't understand, someone good technology would problem understanding
To sum things up, phone lot features
 It isn't advanced person can't eventually figure use them, even used basic phone like I am
 

The Nokia 5300 Xpress feature rich phone
 The camera easy work takes good quality pictures readily transferred via bluetooth computer printer
 The mp3 player sounds great phone, good mp3 player
 The sound quality dramatically improved use headphones
 The lilac darker name suggests nice contrast metallic phones available elsewhere
 The phone also wonderfully tactile--the navigation keys responsive easy work
 My husband sausage fingers problem dialing (he black version)
 The slider mechanism works great doesn't feel phone might break
 For features quality phone good deal price range
The downside phone quality
 My first phone arrived poorly machined back gap left unchecked would certainly let dirt, cat hair, like
 My husband's phone serious problems simply didn't work--there appeared short would light go dark
 His second phone work either similar reasons
 We awaiting fifth phone 10 days
 My second phone okay far received light use
 I yet figure settings, I fairly tech savvy easily daunted technology
I won't know problems flukes poor quality sometime come
 I hoping former, obviously
 

Easy use, stylish, PACKED features
 I reorganized menus suit me
 It 2 preloaded games though
 One trial version, cool
 The stinks I haven't played long enough see trial version
 The music player great easy use
 My last phone TERRIBLE getting songs onto it
 Very convoluted process
 With phone, go Nokia web site download Nokia PC Suite free apps easy use tutorials need them
 Sweet Suite
 With last phone transfer software $80 glitchy I gave never used it
 Also, software converts audio format makes song files small really pack phone music
 I think eACC something like that
 Very efficient
 I also synched outlook
 Yay
 You love phone
 I bought Motorola RAZR case it
 You keep headset plugged in, swivel clip, fits snug tight, leather soft enough push music player volume buttons outside ease, answer phone included headset - need take case
 

I really love little phone
 My complain headphones
 What idiot designed them? The left earbud 6 inches long large knob end click change songs
 It's like strange dangling ear ring
 Who wants reach ear change tunes
 The right earbud 21 inches long
 So you've got bunch wire flapping around chin area you're walking fast
 Which I every day
 The knob cause earbud pop walk fast turn head crossing street
 The earbud can't take weight it
 The knob tie clip holds headphones close length wire ear buds same
I understand idea "sharing
" But would need lean head head share friend phone speaker option play music? This option
 Not norm
 

Good Points->looks good->Good Voice Quality-> Good Music qualityNegative Points->Less Talk time battery 

This may good music player NOT good phone
 After 8 months regular use buttons aren't working go menu options gets "stuck" certain pages options
 This phone Nokia, supposedly one better phones reception, reception terrible service strong weak
 







































































































































































































































































































This third holster I bought, far worked well
 The previous one I owned, broke fell ground
 So far one seems durable holds well pant's waist
 







































































































































































































































































































































































































































This product work,would stay phones screen,so put trash worth buying
Great idea wont stick 







































































Take review grain salt first phone
I liked construction feel; weight size fine me, quite small little heavier might expect
As strictly phone unit works great overkill
 It lot extras, eat battery life quickly
The camera videocapture decent enough quality, voice recorder works fine, bluetooth works, radio feature works ok (though I could never get consistently good reception), mp3 player works, even jimmy 2GB storage thing although Nokia manual says limit 256MB
The reason I ended returning phone features seem draw attention obvious features phone missing---such per-caller ringtones, phone book lets enter first last name separately (so sort either) rather one long name containing both
 Having multiple regions save preset radio stations would nice travel
 The fact 6230's huge memory (not mention hugely expandable memory) makes lack features even sorer spot
Summary: great hardware, great phone function, software rich enough warrant spending $200+ it
 I feel like I getting PDA-level functionality price
 

I've owned many cell phones Nokia convinced next phone another Nokia
 First all, features - addition typical - camera, phone book, etc
 - fantastic software package developed Nokia allows full access transfer files, synchronize contacts, calendar, tasks, etc
 combined fact play MP3s space MMC storage card makes unbeatable value excellent functionality
 I can't help recommened anyone really wants easy way wealth information fingertips - literally
 

I bought like month before
 far good 
 I love product
 easy sleek use camera features
 Additional feature like MP3 MMC, good
 

nokia 6230 switched carriers loved it
 camera awesome pics vids
 radio neat addition cell phone
 mp3 player awesome too
 downloadyour favorite songs phone away go
 






















This phone worth every penny
 It like new upgraded version 8890
 The phone functions 6230 camera video great
 The thing figured Memory card
 I guess phone slot memory cards
 That thuing would change
 

I previously owned 3650 (with round keypad) I used typing small keypad
 I love phone


 The major reason keys small phone small
 The keypad screen interconnected slide metal body phone (which smaller slider phones I seen like Samsung)
 The screen like HD TV producing something like 275,000 colors
 I Bluetooth connection laptop installing Nokia CD ROM onto computer linking two together (which easy) I sent one favorite photos phone, setting wallpaper gorgeous
 The software lets send music backup phone numbers data phone computer visa versa
 The call quality exceptional, WAP internet fast
 The 8801 also type 3D engine built OS, helps produce amazing imaging
 Battery life somewhat less I used to, however, letting battery drain dead recharging 24 hrs
 (using backup provided rotationally) I actually getting 3 hrs talk time suggested
 One last thing I love phone aside fact looks amazing OS easy navigate (as Nokia's) phones SAR's rating tissue radiation cellular device one lowest phone 
45 personally important (the federal limit little 2)
 I hope helps potential buyers make decision, I happy mine
 

This well designed, solid well built phone
 I love despite negative points discussed previous reviews
 

- The two top buttons seem made metal instead plastic STOPPED WORKING
- Very Short Duration Battery 

You want call someone
 I prepared love phone start
 Almost everything exactly I looking save one thing, reception
 I've owned ten different Nokia phones years 8801 far worst comes cell phone's basic function
 My trusty Nokia 6610 comfortably showed four bars excellent reception Tmobile GSM system
 A swap SIM cards yielded fluttering one bar 8801 best
 If you're considering phone, make certain strong reception area
 You'll need it
 

So far, good w/ Nokia 8801
 Very elegant design
 The trade-off: bit heavy
Good reception, intuitive user interface, easy-to-use
 Highly recommended
 

I TOTALLY disappointed phone, even impressed design years, FORMERLY A LOYAL CUSTOMER Nokia (very user friendly softwares, durable phones - I three 6100 row)
LESS THAN A MONTH ONLY use already almost completely useless (


)
 And never fell floor, never hit anything like that
i - The two top buttons seem made metal instead plastic STOPPED WORKING
 The problem essential several features e
g
 reaching 'names' 1-touch; erasing letters typing message; etc
ii - buttons, even traditional plastic ones keyboard functioning well
 The essential 'enter' button middle 4-direction 'cursor' barely working sometimes doesn't work all
As soon I write I will:a - learn return amazon;b - go buy RAZR decent mobile;c - go tell AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE buy lousy phone
'Good luck' deceived 'good looks'
mp 

This fone first flip 0 volume control it's hard hear wind breakin slider action (nice see ball berrings fly out)
 Luckally happened first one I within 30 days, second one I got return lassted slightly longer dead screen
 

I've 8801 month big deception find $700 Nokia won't work Asia Europe 900 band
 I call Nokia express concern told I buy 8800 witch work supported warranty US
 I finally decided return buy Motorola Razr v3 even though I've always owned Nokia till now
 I think 8801 8800 big flashy joke drove away brand
I would advise nobody buy phone unless need let neighbors know $700 phone
 But I neighbor, I know dump enough pay 5 stars hotel room bed sleep on
 I waited phone deception
 

bought crap returned bought w810 sony ericsson, same, better yet dont even try buy w810 getgo
 

I bought phone first appeared amazon slightly six
 The price actually gone needless markup (neimanmarcus) sells nine; however, t-mobile sells 550 w/activation 2yr contract
 I would stick amazon return policy
The phone uses 850/1800/1900 frequencies use world phone
 (The Nokia 8800 supports 900/1800/1900 use anywhere USA t-mobile fyi
) You'll need 850 use states w/any GSM provider t-mobile I *beleive* cingular)
 The 8801 great Nokia reception phones I've used


while people around elevator drop calls normally hangs on
It's important firmware least 3
78 checked typing *#0000# may get rebooting problem seen comments
 Some problem could also using battery lock swivels make sure battery stays down
 The one thing understated 8801 comes 2yr warranty overnight service special number call make wait talk person, awesome ever call it
 I've sent mine back slide breaking it's painless experience
The feature set rich even strange things like programmable RFID tag
 The browser fairly useless download mini

It's expensive phone no-doubt I use home phone & cell I wanted something nice sturdy
 It works great Bluetooth devices even streams music headphones
 I mac set download latest podcast bluetooth phone commute ride listen
Battery life isn't THE best it's vomit
 Plug nite extra charger, plug work


 problem solved
The `scratch less' screen great, speakerphone works well, voice tags work well supplied ear fob
 I really like phone recommend it, highly
 

Stupidly, I spent $900 phone week made available sale U
S
, I bought second one gift
 The phone kept turning automatically, even loaded fully charged battery
 So Nokia sent replacement phone (number 1), loose schmutz screen
 So Nokia sent another replacement phone (number 2), whose keypad backlighting illuminate whenever I opened slide
 So Nokia sent another replacement phone (number 3), automatically inexplicably lost WAP settings every time I switch phone off
 So Nokia sent yet another replacement phone (number 4), slid open far first use, exposing wiring circuitry rendering impossible use
 So Nokia -- God bless -- sent one replacement phone (number 5), I using one week longer makes keypad tone whenever I dial 3, 6, 9, # keys
The phone looks feels sleek, yes
 The charging base emanates pulsating blue light
 The ringtones, composed Ryuichi Sakamoto, beautiful
 But phone colossal waste money: style substance
 The battery lasts pitifully short length time needing recharged
 The interface unattractive confusing, various phone functions located counterintuitively menus would never think search
 Incoming text multimedia messages appear plain, easy-to-read white screen, rather plain black text whatever multicolored theme happen selected, often making content messages impossibly hard read
 Instructions user's manual vague helpful
This phone proof don't always get pay for
 No matter asking price, it's garbage
 And I know: I've six them
 

For reason phone seems generating lot controversy reviews, often, I feel haven't even used it
I've 8801 2 months now, I say full confidence it's best phone market


 me
If you're looking newest whiz-bang features, phone you
If you're looking sensible price performance ratio, it's you
If, however, you're looking phone functions falwlessly phone (Great reception, great sound quality, fantastic user interface) like feel solid slider style phone, could phone you
I hada nokia 8890 almost 5 years finally died, untill 8801 came around - nothing filled it's shoes, I phone exactly 8890 did, works great feels right use
I feel flaws addressed though
 The battery life miserable (but comes 2nd battery fits perfectly little 5th pocket jeans)
 The fancy ringtones bit silly
 Ring volume bit lacking
All it's still perfect phone - I really don't care anyone else notices it
 

In opinion phone 2 1/2 stars I considering people's opinions
 I since I believe kind people would buying phone
Who for: It people who's first concern look feel phone
 This phone looks great, light, makes feel luxurious (even though tad heavy even opinion)
++++'s : Exceptional Look
 Exceptional Feel touch
 Clear screen
 Easy Nokia menus
 Bluetooth, Radio , know stuff would see nokia's website
----'s:1- Buttons small, even small hand (it might size buttons, flush are)2- Too expensive price listed ($650)
 This phone considered new (it released Europe around 3 months ago, Asia 5 months ago)
 I would say good price phone it's +'s -'s around $350 - $4003- Battery life short; hence provide two


4- Radio reception great
5- internal antenna's position somewhat awkward
 The reason I bring bec
 manual says supposed lay fingers hand antenna is
 Yet natural place would hold phone from


6- Even though pretty phone, easily become ugly one: FINGERPRINTS
 The brushed steel body phone made off, clearly shows fingerprints, easy clean (you clean takes longer would expect)In Summery: All I say looking gorgeous phone, don't mind price, short battery life, I 100% recommend phone you, since I checked markets US, Europe, Asia think far nicest, best constructed phone moment (12/2005)
 But looks thing mind I would suggest making evaluation neg
 points I made, see think
 Still $400 I personally think phone good buy, since I believe phone long life (not saying batteries)
Layth 

This pretty cell phone, doubt it
 It beautiful ring tones (although sound better MP3s computer coming phone's speaker -- bit tinny ask me), cute icons, nice sleek lines, addictive feel slide top down
 The packaging phone truly spiffy luxurious
 The 8801 packaging reminds masters area: Apple ipod packaging
Unfortunately, that's enough make good cell phone
 The keypad unfortunate
 The top row keys close lid easily accessible
 Keys sufficiently differentiated us need dial number without looking keyboard
The two pieces phone, screen/camera bit lower portion keypad solidly connected other
 As result, expanded, phone feels rickety jiggles every way, making dialing rather disconcerting
Your mileage certainly vary
 I sure looks phone enough make hit
 For me, needed
 

As reviews, keys smaller I imagined
 Phone could also use bit volume
 Camera features sometimes crash much I'm annoyed
 Having treo 600 - 650 - 700 user 3 years, crash problamatic are
 Phone beautiful nice operate claim is
 It feels right slide open press buttons (kind remind HP calculator buttons)
 Nice job aesthetics/mechanics
 Scratch resistant check


 it's something million people like razors
 But kudos razor's quad band price
 Bottom line


 I wanted something different don't regret buying it
 

I purchased Nokia 8801 simply I grown disenchanted selection cellular phones available today
 After much searching I finally decided purchase Nokia, happy first
The Pros
It's beautifully crafted phone; elegant sleek, constructed high quality materials
 When hold device hand feels substantial, flimsy plastic like many phones market
 The stainless construction makes beautiful phone, also something feels expensive durable
 Simply put, I bought phone asthetic qualities
 The mechanism allows opening closing device solid
 It quality engineering execution well done, one best features phone
The Cons
As may read reviews, screen burn-in problem
 This happens phone activates power saving function
 After two days use, I began notice problem
 It annoying first seconds, using functions phone, barely noticable
 But still annoying
The keypad exception beautiful sturdy crafting phone
 After one week normal useage, keypad broke
 The bottom left key, # key, fell phone
 It popped off
 The keypad flimsy injection-molded plastic, feels cheap
 I don't know didn't use metal portion well, really lessens arching feel jewelry phone has
Nokia totes excellent "special" customer care program people buy phone
 This apparently cover much all
 I tried send phone back Nokia repair hoping would remedy broken key problem
 In warranty information comes phone, claim "enhanced customer care" say ship replacement phone send phone back leisure
 THIS IS NOT THE CASE
 They finite list "acceptable" instances warrants type customer care
 Everything else ship yourself, paid yourself, back Nokia repair department engineers examine device assess whether defect falls warranty
 Mind you, week purchase, annoying
 I believe keypad breaking covered warranty
 Nokia thinks otherwise
 So engineer assesses situation, assess cost
 FOR THE 8801 NOKIA, THERE IS A MINIMUM REPAIR FEE OF $150 DOLLARS
 I informed this, spending much money phone, thinking I buying premium brand premium care
 So now, I'm $150 dollars addition money I spent purchase phone
 And course one week
I still think overall phone beautifully built, I would buy go experience
 The battery life horrible, provide two
 Overall, I negative experience product
 After week, I went purchased Samsung BLACKJACK
 I use 8801 special occasions


 it's flashy, great everyday phone
In conclusion, thinking buying sleek, elegant phone envy around you





 wait iPhone come Apple June 2007
I hope review helpful
 

The Nokia 8801 beautiful piece work
 People appreciate fine time pieces expensive pens (such myself) would find price phone outrageous extravagant
The Nokia 8801 sleek moderately thin phone
 The stainless steel case designed nicely, hard edges
 The curves right places
 Upon picking phone holding it, combination solid heft cool feeling gives impression piece art, finely crafted every curve every edge precisely placed
Opening phone pleasure
 With flick thumb, smooth upward sliding action engaged springs, track smoothed ball bearings screen sails gracefully upwards
 The keypad smoothly transitions gentle white glow
 Some people uncomfortable "schhk" noise made screen slid reveal keypad, claiming sounds like break
 But kind people can't appreciate phone last ages due strong robust construction
A smooth rock solid piece scratch-resistant glass shields brilliant screen displays vivid wallpapers depicting beautiful waves leaves
The speaker (used speakerphone/music) surprisingly high quality
 Although tad tinny side, sound reproduced fairly accurately without distortion, even high volumes
 The speaker, one conversations played through, bit low volume even set maximum
Now, physical beauty made little less attractive innards
 My complaint physical aspect phone keypad: I feel witht rest phone exquisite, plastic keys ruin it
 A metallic feeling like found RAZR keypads order
 Actually, I also found slightly difficult remove battery cover, beginning: I since grown accustomed effective way remove cover
The software side flaw
 Oftentimes I find difficult read words displayed white background
 Practically schemes backgrounds make hard read: fine tuning way I got around it
Another flaw screen saver
 The screensaver display time date LCD use
 However, displayed darkened band across screen
 I discovered week usage, anything displayed color discoloration across band
 This basically burn-in problem
 On hand, whites affected
 In fact, I call ask this


I enjoyed using different phone profiles, customizing one particular needs
 Especially useful automatic use profile phone docked charger
 You even set profiles expire certain time
 A good example usage: turning Silent profile 8 hours sleep
 It revert current profile end 8 hours
The Bluetooth capability robust: listen music Bluetooth
 Also, record conversations, although every five seconds beep (apparently barely noticeable side)
 It easy use music player, though many reviewers noted, shame phone included small amount memory failed include option expandable memory via slot
There small suite useful tools, including stopwatch, countdown timer, alarm clock, even FM Radio
 However, order utilize radio must connect wired headset, reason wire acts antenna
I find battery life fine, though I put beautiful desk charger every night
 The desk charger, like phone, beautiful stainless steel, gentle curves
 The base pulses slowly 10 seconds so, fading out, emitting sharp blue
 I would've preferred white softer glow, I don't look often anyway
 The charger charge second battery
 For clarification (which I needed buying), set Amazon come second battery
 I yet use though
Overall, phone worth user requires lots technology business features, would like impress people
 Every person I've shown got jealous: half got mock angry mimed throwing phone ground
 Don't keep phone pocket pouch: meant gazed upon lusted after
 

This phone attracted attention phone I ever owned
 I switch phones every 6 months one reason another (bored it, breaks, etc)
 I think I keep phone while
 Everyone sees allways asks see hold it
 It looks cool
It offer many options phones there, come w/ Bluetooth, 2 batteries, charging dock, pouch, hands free (wired) option
 It feels solid Razr bulky Treo 650 (my last 2 phones)
I switch battery bluetooth works great
 The pouch isn't best carry option (I purchased market holster) I already bluetooth headset I didn't use wired option
I noticed easy turn power mistake
 I set phone lock keys 5 sec, it's much issue since phone automatically unlocks slide keys/screen up
Overall, really cool phone works great
 In opinion options could want CELL PHONE, nice (calendar, camera) time time don't really make break me
 

I owned phone 6 months now
 It given gift last summer, although expensive purchase, I honestly say someone hadn't bought me, I'd bought myself
From sleek stainless steel cover scratchless screen, phone definitely one kind market
I seen people compare motorola razr, I can't see grounds comparison, except possibly battery life weak
 But, come extra battery, desk charger makes possible charge phone extra batter time, Nokia really think hard fixing flaws
All all, would perfect new accessory handbag/pocket
 Not 'matrix-looking' phone, everything phone does, style
 

ordered phone last night
 haven't received yet - hopefully friday - according representative spoke with
i've read many reviews regarding phone, U
S
 version - NOKIA 8801 (8800 version Africa, Asia & Europe) mixed reviews "metal" phone
as mentioned beginning, i'm still waiting phone
 soon receive it, able provide better review
 now, i'm giving (1) one STAR
********************** *********************Part two & Final thoughts


Continuation first review


After long decision anticipation purchase phone, finally arrived
I placed order midnight(EST) Wednesday I'm impressed delivery time (delivered Friday)
The packaging Nokia well thought of
 When open box, phone story book first items greet (as sound harmonious alleluias sounds back mind)
 You're eyes light (at least mine did)
 The inside packing lined velvet contents neatly packaged inside
 Since expensive phone, Nokia even thought packaging model
After installing SIM card (Cingular) powering up, I noticed screen display clear carrier name displays screen
 The phone attract finger prints, easily wiped pouch comes phone
 The cradle / charger pretty neat
 The base cradle blue light it's plugged in
 The screen part phone slides reveal keypad
 It's push button mechanism might think looking phone
 With slight push thumb, you'll notice quality sliding design Nokia made
 It's sturdy unlike first predecessors Nokia 8860 & 8890
 The keypad (in opinion) cumbersome writers mentioned
 If large fingers, bit challenge use keys
 Keep mind phone voice dial one touch dialing feature
 Taking back cover bit challenge, due time get used it
 The batteries small compared Nokia 6620 models matter
 I guess besides not-so-strong power battery (talk time stand time), it's nice get two batteries cost around $50 dollars
 Nokia should've used battery size 6620 model
 But looking size phone, it's understandable it's small battery size
 In time I'm sure come powerful battery I'm sure sites sell batteries less, Nokia recommends purchase accessories reputable authorized dealer
Is lengthy review what? I didn't get paid say - I've Nokia fan long time
 Keep mind thoughts review help decide whether purchase not
There problems (yet - knock wood) I've encountered since I've installed SIM card
 I've made received calls already calls clear
 I know price phone almost grand, Amazon
com (by far) offers best deal
 I know


I know


I should've tried Ebay I did
 I'm sold "bidding" aspect it
 Some sell included accessories "extras" it's originally part package
 Be aware sellers


 Don't get wrong, honest not
 It's you
 Again, opinion
Going back phone review


I change previous (1) one "star" rating (4) four "stars"
 Why 4 ??? Because NOTHING perfect
 Everyone entitled opinion(s) mine
 This one expensive one-item purchases I've made besides SLR digital camera (that's another story)
The bottom line


if like unique one-of-a-kind items you're "techno-sexual" like I who's technology, need get phone
 If go store sells phone hold buy it


do it, get idea size feel phone
 That's I trying I cannot find store it
 Needless say, I'm disappointed phone I opened box held phone hand (it's small phone compared photos seen various sites) navigating menus, way concept good old earlier Nokia models (if you've owned earlier Nokia phone(s), know I'm talking about)
I hope thoughts / review helped decide whether purchase "stainless steel" phone
GOOD LUCK
tatak pNOY 

I say I love phone
 It absolutely *gorgeous*
 It even comes it's charging base emits blue light around bottom phone charging somehow makes nightstand look stylish too
 The phone also comes second battery conveniently supply extra space charging station unused battery charge time
 The problems far getting back cover whenever I remove battery also Nokia doesn't seem produced car charger phone yet (hence they've provided second battery I guess
) Anyway, love phone that's conversation piece, phone buy
 I purchased RAZR first came every time I pulled thing public someone commented
 Well phone eye catcher RAZR *and* one yet people really talking
 In terms functionality, phone doesn't seem much phones there, cares? It's gorgeous
 :o) It's also extremely thin (about thinness RAZR although skinnier little longer) stored away pocket easily
 Also, unlocked phone I kinda worried process getting work Cingular I popped SIM card I able dial everything immediately
 Overall, great phone buy (oh I got mine CompUSA cheaper here, shhh, don't tell anybody :o)
 

All I look phone looks, small is, fast (browsing address book, deleting messages, going menues)
 The 8801 perfectly considering Color phone
Phones getting smaller faster
 The best example 8890 I owned 3 years
 That phone lag erase messages browse menues
 I happy "small fast" trend came slow color phones
 Not that, soon followed camera phones
With color camera phone combination, cells started increase size functions
 Speed, however, given much interest
 All wanted print spec sheets showing many actions particular cell phone perform
Well I AM HAPPY say 8801 none nonesence
 It cammera, takes horrible pictures I dont care (I actually rather phone one)
 This phone exactly I looking for
 Its 8890, color version
If want FAST, BEAUTIFUL, HEAD TURNING phone it
Nokia warrants phone two years find special number warranty manual phone
 If soemething ever goes wrong 8801, call number wont wait get answered
 Explain problem get phone shipped overnight
Nokia great phone, also providing Customer Service it
The ONLY drawback far I've everyone wanting take look phone I take puch talk someone
 It really stands croud
When people see bulky phones, ask many MP camera go online things downloaded


 When see 8801, want TOUCH it, SEE really closely, ask much costed
 I guarantee phone (except VERTU phones) catch type attension
Yes, theNokia 8801 expensive, perfect
 Materials used design think far beyond phone
 Same Ferrari, yeah charge LOT them, masterpiece joined carbon fiber expensive extra gadgets dont see outside car
 

When I first saw phone I truly love, phone someone clue money, conception value obviously common sense
Yes, I one people I it
 All I say I love phone I love children
 From sleek look luxurious feel, I knew I made first phone call phone me
The stainless steel body comes handy especially drop phone often I do
 After dropping phone numerous occasions Nokia walked away scratch
 The window made watch glass protect window scratches also
I like heaviness size phone, short battery life could annoying, I usually get full day full charge, hence phone comes spare battery
 The key pad # small thank god speed dialing
 One things I dislike phone difficult adjust listening volume, must done phone
Bad news: Had take small loan pay phone
 Good news: When kids grown gone wife spending social security check Bingo, Nokia 8800 still side
 

Sadly elegant phone seriously flawed
 I realised package arrived containing two batteries, clear warning
 The battery time ridiculosly short infuriate anyone uses phone business calls road
 Sure, there's spare battery carry even personal time
Another issue susceptibility humidity
 Although I never dropped phone spilt water it, gradual deterioation key pad response within 3 months
 Eventually critical keys stopped responding altogether
 I sent phone back Nokia fully expecting refund replacement informed water damage
 Living Florida natural level humidity Nokia don't consider relevant
 The phone hyper sensitive used people keep little leather pouch provide 99% time
 Anyone needs real phone rather pure fashion statement look elsewhere
 Similarily it's sad see lack care Nokia demonstrates key customers spent significant funds high end range
 

If looking premium primary cell phone, Moto SLVR L7 Moto RAZR V3i much better choices
 Besides outrageously expensive price tag compared competitors, Nokia 8801 doesn't many areas brag about
 However, extremely gorgeous phone
 Every angle phone exudes quality luxury
 The sliding phone upwards reveal keypad addicting
 The solid "thud" hear reveal keypad extremely satisfying try person
As fashion accessory second "weekend/party" phone, I would given solid 5 stars since beautiful physically stunning phone market right now
 However, rest us day job earn living, price-to-performance ratio key deciding premium prmary phone buy
First all, even though Nokia 8801 advertised world phone, tri-band NOT supporting GSM 900 Mhz
 Meaning countries, phone rendered useless poor signal
 This maybe unacceptable us pay $600+ dosmetic-only phone
 If happen travel China, could use phone tell time prehaps much else since China use GSM 900 Mhz
 So world travellers need aware that
After resounding "thud" reveal keypad, greeted slight disappointment
 The keypad ordinary small
 You could easily press two buttons doesn't luxury touch it
 The LCD screen beautiful tad small
 Moto RAZR SLVR shines LCD keypad department
Features-wise comparison becomes ordinary, "not-worth-the-money" phone
 You could get tons phone free, like Nokia 6682 basically set features
 For shoppers yearn latest bells-and-whistles, sorry folks
 earth shattering features here
 Just old gizmos
Just reiterate looking premium primary phone best price-to-performance ratio, I suggest look elsewhere
 Moto RAZR SLVR excellent choices - There reason Motorola shipped 50 millionth RAZR worldwide
 Amazing feat
But owned solid reliable sedan, looking fancy convertible summer weather, phone much worth consideration
 

I don't landline, I rely cell
 I 8890 years loved it
 I saw 8801 natural upgrade
 I've impressed disappointed
First, obvious, battery issue
 I knew going battery life sub-par
 OK, I live given screen
 However, 10 months, batt won't keep phone alive 12 hours
 I bought new batt, sad
 And phone doesn't reliably seat properly charging station
 I find simply plugging directly I need sure it's gonna get recharged
The web browser awful
 And I can't get mini opera work right cingular
 In fact, cingular won't even help troubleshoot since isn't one "their" phones
The dedicated help line nice
 The reception adequate
 It's annoying, though, accidentally turn head wrong way call cause slider hang up
 I find email feature invaluable
Overall, I'd probably buy price I paid came initially
 The 8801 definately compromise style vs
 substance
 

I've phone week chance try features except Bluetooth headset feature (since I don't Bluetooth headset)
 I must say I really like phone, facets take getting used to
 Some highlights experience far are


Look Feel:The look feel camera absolutely top-notch
 The phone, others noted, good weight it
 The phone isn't heavy, it's definitely feels substantive
 It bit fingerprint magnet, shiny accessories like PSP black iPod
 A couple wipes included pouch takes care fingerprints (the pouch made synthetic suede-like material drags across phone bit resistance wipes away fingerprints easily)
The charger dock tre cool well
 The base dock "ground effects" blue LED cycles lumination plugged in
 Very soothing, cool
Techy stuff:Voice quality phone good
 I hear callers clearly me
 Not much else said there
The phone comes suite software enables synchronize contacts (only using phone's memory, SIM card memory), upload music wallpapers, make backups content phone
 All done via Bluetooth, computer Bluetooth capability, don't need buy additional cables kits
 This first phone I could update via PC, I say, I never go back updating things within phone again
I data plan phone (that's Blackberry for) I didn't check web browser all
Cons:The minor negative I phone keypad
 As others noted, keypad bit small, especially navigation keys
 I found I ended pressing 2 key trying scroll quite times
 This especially annoying first two days so; however, week using playing phone, I've gotten completely used size layouts keys
 When first use phone, I'm pretty sure you'll annoyed keys, I'm also sure you'll get used within time
All all, nice phone across board
 

It looks good, many issues worth price point
 When $900 bad purchase >$400 still bad choice
 If phone goes $100 I might buy pretty paper weight
 

Don't listen bad reviews, sounds like don't even one
 I mine 2
5 years still works perfectly
 Can say typical $99 phone? Most pieces junk broken six months
The good: looks great, feels solid, obviously dead reliable (including worldwide travel), many features, one could possibly use all
 And care, you'll get positive comments anyone sees it, reason buy opinion
The bad: yes, keys small
 But average size guy get used texting super fast time
 It certainly difficult text iPhone
 And camera junk, question (0
5 MP)
 But new Nokia 8800 arte 3
2 MP camera
Overall, I darn happy I 400 hours talk time it
 

nokia 8801 attractive phone, however functional
 keys small make hard type text messages
 battery life joke, last half day normal usage
funtionality justify price
 

First all, I see lot hate reviews people doesn't even phone
 Some negative points made phone true;-we get 'top-notch' phone-the phone replaces (8890i, 8890) brought new features, phone simply not-might little bit lighter (138gr
)-attracts finger prints huge problem made reviews, pouch provided takes care perfectlyBut big catch point I say phone replaces; DO NOT expect see proce cuts phone RAZR, phone always exclusive
 From we've seen past (8810, 8890, 8910i), sure
 8890i still sells 550$ new
If person like changes phones like socks, know important is
 As time goes on, phone bought 9 months ago gets old, DESIGN gets old, start see everywhere
 It feel exclusive anymore
 Before phone I owned S700, I paing 649$ (same prove I paid 8801 now), 8 months later price 379$ lost exclusivity SonyEricsson started use design phones
 Same thing goes RAZR, almost 1 4 phones RAZRs there
 Because price 200$
My plan keep phone least 3 yrs
, I bought CompUSA 2yrs
 extended warranty, anything goes bad replace new one
 They DO NOT try fix problem, change new one phone class don't 8801 anymore
 The price 599$ 2 yr
 warranty around 65$
 It also possible extend warranty expires
It pretty clever buy price think time period using it
 Whatever happens, I phone long period time, I also mpx220 I use advanced features(Windows Mobile 2003SE), 2 make perfect couple opinion :)In summary, phone good choice person cares looks features
 This phone surely last years
 It good investment people afford 

I don't get it
 Before I ordered phone, I read reviews listed here
 I understand may received faulty equipment, I personally found best made phone I come across
It's rock solid phone I used
 As far sliding mechanism "rickedy", I don't see it, I find well made solid
 Not hefty piece, things can't others
 For example, I using Motorola SLVR 6 months
 When I purchased it, sales rep told Bluetooth enabled possibilities endless
 WOW


 It must really cool

 HA

 The thing Bluetooth fact use wireless earpiece
 That's it
 With Nokia 8801, I able add songs, video, host files drag drop ease using Bluetooth
 You access everthing it
 One thing I agree reviews keys little small, turns irrelevent get use it
 Yes, price little steep, get pay all
 So it
 Functionality Great looks
 What could want

 I would recommend phone anyone asked
 

This great phone
 It feels great hand; sound level good; menus easy navigate; camera better RAZR; connects seamlessly bluetooth devices( I use Plantronics 640A), including computer
 The software comes phone good easy
 The downsides include buttons seem small bit slippery; I haven't able connect internet, Nokia Cingular haven't able assist
 I without internet access 24/7
 Despite flaws, greatest phone I ever had
 I RAZR backup 3100 that
 Best phone ever
 If like phone going see crowd can't afford Vertu, then, phone you
 

Love sleek look, slim design sliding face hides keys
 The camera ok, I bought phone I wasn't buying camera design
 Although phone little heavier I usually like keys little small close together I'd say overall great phone I happy it
 

hello,I got phone week I happy get it
 I ama fan previous version kind, 8890 titanium, I around 5 2 different versions plus nokia 9290 since 2000 recently I got V3 razor every single person street
 I decided go something unique absolutely timeless,the 8801
first all, users buyers, keep phone pouch wont get dirty scratched
 reviewers:the pouch ACTUAL cleaning accessory phone
 immediately cleans residue fingerprints etc
I recommend use phone bluetooth device(I got discovery 640 kit it) second hold put ears screen gets little prints plus prevent dropping getting dirty hands

the reception battery life good
 slim ion battery NEEDS charged least 10 hours full use phone right away without fully charged function properly loose power shortly
this phone daily use business oriented oneif need business you`re better PDA market
Believe me, anybody sees phone raises eyebrows andhold breath couple seconds say WOW 

:)it awesome charger lids electric blue whole bottom
 looks beautiful night time
if you`re sophisticated person, likes mobility
luxury, quality phone absolutely you
Ask simple question, would rather get metal phone last years get plastic made phone last couple years that`d fade,scratch gets fashion?best wishes,ztt
 

I love phone
 I issues sound quality reception ever
 I use Cingular provider took get text messaging web work Cingular sell phone therefore cannot really support either
 They actually gave 45 minutes phone (they really helpful though), playing around using Nokia site setting phone everything works
 I spent another couple hours surfing J2ME applications/games I something kill time :) This phone sweet


Brian - San Francisco 

If would like buy phone people tell good looks, phone you
 If not, good choice
 The battery life terrible hardly hear thing talking environment even minimal amount noise
 For price get much better phone
 

Just really cool phone , it's really worth buying speaker quality best , little heavy , small size 
 

This item mix jewel, luxury timepiece course 1st class phone


 Those would seriously intersted 8801, would know it's amazing pedigree higest-end Nokia products served succesful people world
 Of course product flaws, mentioned reviews (most significant size position keys), overal manages perform it's secodary function phone, fabulous job primal, atracting attention
 If want swith VERTU someday I would think would nice start
 But anyway Nokia 8801 amazing product
 I recomend everyone know is


 ;-) 

The Nokia 8801 definitely great phone
 The fit, finish, craftsmanship top notch, design impeccable
 The sliding mechanism unlike phone market, addictive
 The motion crisp decisive, attention detail (even packaging included accessories) immediately tangible
No doubt bulk cost phone due design element time spent manufacturing phone
 It certainly feature-packed, does, well
 If you're looking phone handles basic essentials (bluetooth, PIM, etc), want something look really good time, look further
The phone's weight definitely concern - it's hefty size, yet it's built like rock
 It could smidge lighter, also doesn't really bother me
The keypad rather small
 Those clumsy hands cumbersome digits would likely happy, I haven't many problems, I'm still getting used it
 Besides, phone (nighttime travel) 7280, keypad
 I'm distressed
The 8801 best summed premium phone, rather feature-packed multimedia device
 The 8801 even special access numbers priority support care Nokia - clearly phone masses
 It even specially-composed ringtones Ryuichi Sakamoto, specially-created themes wallpapers
 Buy phone stand crowd
 

























































































































































This item isn't anything special
 It's Nokia Micro-USB charger
 The one ships N97
 Better getting eBay
 
















I used Jabra earbud Samsung phone 2 years, I disappointed I couldn't use set new Nokia 8200, Jabra great job product
 There wasn't whole lot needed improving first place, three ear piece sides either left right allow comfortable fit, microphone great job picking everything up, speaker works great (you hear level ambient noise)
 But Jabra make good improvements superficially, gone neon ear pieces, replaced subtle colors, structurally well
 The earpiece much sturdier predecessor, sized earpieces fit much snuggly speaker/microphone can't slide off, finally on/off switch handy
There wasn't much room improve product, already fantastic, Jabra managed so
 This product actually makes phone better, I highly recommend it
 

The on/off button mike rattles audibly
 Since mike is


 picks loudly
 It bothered me
 Then I listener say hurting ears
 I obtained brand new Jabra Earbud identical problem
 I returned come back
 Jabra's appear nice, earbud button near mike
 

Worked beautifully first phone call that, kaput
 It started shorting wouldn't work all--and I promise I didn't bang around anything ordinary it
 

I opportunity try Jabra unit several others considerably cheaper
 The one thing I cannot get Jabra lousy sound compared JVC TF-HF20
 The Jabra unit sound borders almost unusable


 I like &quot;jelly&quot; insert ability use earpiece without clip wire speaker poor quality ruins overall sound beyond anything else I heard
 Would definitely recommend (unless like &quot;muddy&quot; sound)
 

I bought Jabra Nokia 6160, found unusable
 I couldn't hear anything, callers could barely hear me
 I replaced Jabra Plantronics headset worked much better
 For recently purchased Ericsson, I bought factory earpiece works better Jabra, well
In experience, headsets separate mike speaker work much better one-piece unit Jabra
 


The Nokia Exotic Butterfly Faceplate offers way creative Nokia 5100 series phone
What better way show true personality bright colerful faceplates
 Nokia offers many still unique
 And hey, beats boring black standard faceplates
 This surely keep using messy stickers personal flare
 And get tired one least 100 chose from
 You could change every day wanted easy change
 




















































The price certainly right

 $
01

 Shipping prompt works fine

 Couldn't ask more
 

Great product, quick shipping
 I issues product - simple, straightforward , clean processing :) 

Sometimes stops charging got wiggle I think phones port wore chargers fault
 

Works fine charging phone
 Cable plugs solid enough far I tell
 

















Great replacement battery super good price
 So much lower priced one Nokia company lasts lasts
 Would hesitate order again
 

Battery arrived thin plastic bag mailer
 The battery bubble wrap
 The package "fragile" sticker it
 My hope elephant didn't sit mail process
 I thought maybe guys buy batteries bulk sell one time, without kind impact cushion? Ok, it's Christmas
 They're busy
 I charged battery day
 Still dead
 Are selling dead batteries? 

Had aunts phone three months back charge little Nokia every third fourth day use like new
 

I may change review later, far battery seems holding rather well
 I use power RF remote mini-mouse/keyboard home theater PC
 

Received batter good time far works good expected
 Would purchase another item retailer
 

I purchased two Nokia BL-4C batteries Amazon Marketplace vendor HollyCellular
 Received quickly good condition
I've using item daily Nokia 6133 month
 It seems work fine
 My phone exhibits battery life new
Here I rated 4 stars instead 5 stars: The Nokia authenticity label (laser-etched sticker) differed somewhat label appeared original battery item replacing, I go Nokia's site full comparison
 Because inconvenience, 4 stars
This item appears genuine Nokia product
Bonus: It fixed broken phone
 Let explain



 I second Nokia 6133 I given "not worth fixing" (it strange power issue preventing powering fully; would shut powering up)
 When I placed new battery "broken" Nokia 6133, powered fine
 I hope I able fully recover second Nokia 6133; looks like really needed new battery
 (Your mileage may vary far fixing old phones
) 

product I expected delivery later specified
 This cause problems phone went dead hours
 











































This hard plastic cover easy install gives bit protection phone without thick heavy
 Though I agree reviewers pinwheel design clip poor, I feel fact color chips away short period time reason look else wear
 The black color shell comes scratches easily, period couple months looks cheap ugly
 Underneath black coating silver metallic cover makes scratches obvious
 And doesn't take scratches appear
 No matter careful cover look like hell couple months
 Pass up



 

The clip gears swivel break easy, make plastic probably China
 Why use metal people
 And find replacement clip parts you'll need order whole new case
 

The clip somewhat difficult handle
 To pull phone clip one required lot strenght fingers


 use hand
 Otherwise liked product (using another belt clip) 





























































I've always used Clear Touch Crystal brand cell phone
 Best Performance
 I would never use anything else
 









































































































































































































































































































































I someone buys latest greatest car market
 And I buy car, tends couple years old I hold well past I gotten rid it, typically retiring car it's 8 10 years old several hundred thousand miles it
 What I've learned technique never buy car dealer option whiz bang features technology improves incredible rate
 Something I love technology today phone becoming central device gobbling consuming everything around it
 With advent AD2P stereo Bluetooth, gone wires gizmo's get music phone car stereo
 And I don't need one little shiny white cult object white wire silhouette bitten fruit either, I Nokia CK-20W
 I thrown away headset, aux jacks, FM Modulators
 Everything neatly tucked away Bluetooth bliss
 Mind you, installation faint heart
 You need find way bridge unit car's stereo require unit hard wired power car's electrical system
 I found good independent install $65, current price CK-20W bargain $28, I whole set done $100
 For car (a 2002 BMW 525iT Station Wagon), I Samsung Blackjack II SGH-I617 Windows Mobile Phone built AD2P Bluetooth 8 GB Micro SD flash holds 1200 songs
 The car also XM Commander hard wired car's Rear CD Changer harness USA SPEC Aux Interface Part No
 DF-BMW
 This device allows aux input OEM stereo track 6th CD
 So I XM Radio Track 1 CK-20W Track 2
 While main unit CK-20W neatly tucked away somewhere dash, 3 components decide place open
 The first main controller allows use push talk, Mute pair phone unit, 2nd microphone hands free driving third (the disadvantage unit) external speaker listening phone calls
 Yes, music play stereo speakers, calls handled 3 inch square speaker box
 It may nuisance place it, sound loud, crisp clear
 For car, I put controller right shifter, microphone dash, speedometer speaker left steering wheel fairly well concealed
 If creative, may able hide creative place
 Now everything place, device fantastic
 It effortlessly switches MP3's phone calls back again
 I mindful I listening radio mute incoming call though
 Voice Command also works seamlessly
 Nokia provided button press controller rather fumble phone, anything Ford/Microsoft Sync do
 In all, it's best "gizmo" I bought long, long while
 It may take little bit expertise get configured, it's in, golden
 

Description states unit powered via cigarette lighter
 This true
 The unit needs connected directly fuse box (professional installation)
 




























































The cable caused errors phone I called customer service - acted like I idiot couldn't follow instructions use cable
 I would avoid like plague
 














































































































































This tip job little loose connected phone
 Was able use home, car, tip kept coming answering phone
 
























































































































































































This comfortable headset I ever worn
 I wear ten hours day, five days week
 I work noisy environment I wear noise reducing earmuffs
 The earmuffs fit comfortably seal headset boom protruding
 I wear glasses headset interfere all
 The downside headset dongle control module
 The answer button recessed enough easy bump button hang people
 I glued plastic washer around button I don't problem anymore
 If got rid dongle together answer button headset, would greatest headset ever made (IMHO)
 

FIDELITY IS WONDERFUL ON THE EAR PIECE
 IT IS AN UNUSUALLY METHOD OF FITTING TO THE EAR BUT EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE, ALTHOUGH NOT SIMPLE TO PUT ON AT FIRST
 

Very comfortable ear plug design
 I can't even feel sometimes
Good sound quality
 The wind noise reduce voice tube helpful
 The person talking can't hear noise even I riding bike
 



This far best In The Ear fitting headset won't slip, fall out, hurt ear
 If don't blue tooth best ear headset
 The complaint I tiny wires inside line easily shorted loose audio
 If really careful it's great
 
















































































































































































































































































































Costs far less buying cell phone provider, even add shipping, essentially product
 I problem charger
 

I love product because, it's good item buy I recomend everyone friends 
 

I haven't single problem using weeks
 Worth buy priced nicely
 





































































































































OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It it's job, unintuitive, overly-layered interface
 For example, memory card battery
 The phone must shut & taken apart change memory card


 turning phone back takes little while
 This representative entire phone operation
 Not impatient
If you've never used advanced mobile phone before, might assume par course, simply isn't
 Even instruction booklet order
APPLICATIONS: It lots applications work well


 eventually find finally open
 No matter accustomed phone become, much time required get to, open close applications
 On hand, one may leave many applications open once, hide return left - similar Mac
 Me likes
The 6600 ameneties - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter more
The phone Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor
 I'm sure phone w/ features exists yet
 


I'm sure I'd want spend THAT much time w/ device, anyhow
DEPENDABILITY: I've seen glitches
 I've problems w/ phone
STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys small, generally doesn't bother spaced I employ little 'Braille,' keys run other, careful attn
 must paid dialing
As appearance, well, that's subjective
 Few look phone know it's 'all that'
 It's stylized Sony Samsung
 Less Benz/obvious; Audi/understated
Although chubby hips, device isn't really big
 Solid, squeak-free, large screen
MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless
 First all, phone houses great deal memory multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc
 Secondly, info sent computer w/o hassle USB wires
 Still sure? If max phone memory sent wish computer, memory card w/a good deal storage well
 This small deal
 If you're still whining storage, deleting games free-up still memory
RECEPTION: This really depends locale & carrier
 The 6600 (T-Mobile) true 'world phone' mhz operate around globe, including New Zealand Australia (900) whereas 6620 (available Cingular) replaces w/ 800mhz (some refer 850)
 The latter provide better coverage remote areas The States still operates many countries, excluding New Zealand Australia
 The 6600 provide similar service developed areas The States well remote areas
 As 6600 uses 900mhz, operates countries 6620
The battery life less stellar, charges w/ quickness
 Remember, phone uses operating system - Symbian


 it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors
 It films 10 second video, crying loud
 The battery life can't long; let's greedy
GAMES - Java
 Don't use them, I delete addtl space
 In humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong hands teenagers
IMP: Two important pieces advice - Visit Nokia's site
 There number downloads needed/available phone & texted cost
 The downloads basic advanced operations
The second piece advice - Be prepared spend lot time w/ phone
 If expect able pick things you're rush via common sense, many times you'll end frustrated
 A Sony Ericcson may phone you


 good luck finding one w/ features & competitive price
 Keep mind nearly every screen, number 'along side' 'beneath' them


 every 'save,' choices phone memory, memory card sim card
Despite critical start, phone deserves four stars accomplishes sets (which pretty lofty)


 most


 well


 dependable
 It's high-line Audi, Cadillac suspension, reasonable price
When consider expandability (downloads via computer), numerous features, two transmission programs multiple storage devices, dependability - phone isn't easy out-grow
I would suggest phone simple-minded


 simply don't need many features
 

I highly recommend phone
 I Sony ericsson T610 T610 far inferior
Pros:- Very easy use user interface- Screen extremly sharp bright
 Excellent visibility even direct sunlight
- Symbian OS lots 3rd party software available- Lot's cool games available phone (even play hacked n-gaged games)- Software available play MP3's movies- Bluetooth- Speakerphone- You surf web fully functional HTML browersCons:- Battery life okay used lot day- A little thicker I prefer 

went T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing Sony T610
 It multifunction phone, reception quality better 610
 speaker phone quality good, poping 512mb MMC card, rocks 
 putting MP3 player, lots games application download
DOwnside size phone, BIG today's standard
 battery life bad 
I could hardly use without recharge 2 days
 bit dissapoitnd that
 GPRS web access sloooooooooooooow
DaveC 

I UK resident I cell phone
 I love it
 It might poor man's PDA I wanted I wanted half half one each
It annoying MMC Card battery, least safer there, say slid side
Battery life low well, I didn't want brick make calls from, 2004, 1984
Bluetooth seems cool too
I noted user said wasn't autolock feature: is
 Go Settings&gt;Security&gt;Autolock Period&gt;enter number minutes want locks click &quot;OK&quot; enter phone's security code i
e 12345 (Nokia standard, I'd change it)
 When goes standby phone lock
 Enter code et voila unlocked
 I would also lock phone add another SIM card, phone unusable then
I love fact add web browsers etc phone also load photos via IR Kodak Picture Center(available Nokia 7650/3650)This cellular telephone worth 5 stars 30GBP line rental
 

Nokia rocks
 I model hottie Asia 4 months results fantabulous
 The camera resolution great speaker vol
 great too
 Thank Amazon giving great deal
 

I need repeat what's great phone
A things I want suggest improvements:1) phone card calling feature
 This phone doesn't include Phone card calling
 So dial phone card access number, PIN card, choose "send touch tone" find contact address book
 This process annoying unsafe driving stick shift highway
 For phone card PIN Free dialing setup, little bit lucky
 All need choose "phone card" contact "send touch tone" choose contact
 This feature important I make lot international calls
 My old Sony Ericsson T610 feature
 All I need choose contact option select "calling card call"
2) Low volume regular answering
 In noisy environment, it's hard hear earpiece
 You use speaker handsfree, get larger volume
 Speaker volume loud clear sacrifaces battery life
 

I purchased phone month ago, although intense love affair dwindled, I must say I stand truly satisfied customer
 If plan acquiring additional software utilizing bluetooth connection, I highly reccomend phone, internet saved arse times, well broad spectrum programs universal remote control application anti-mosquito one
 (not included phone)If plan play around much perhaps less powerful aesthetically pleasing phones market
 However plan harness power Symbian OS it's quite great time, 50 bucks, resist? 

I purchased two phones together Amazon market place
If purchasing phone, make sure handle speed phone
 This phone suitable fast people, maybe old people
The menu pops 3 secondsThe picture takes load slow card memory
The navigation takes much time would eventually drive crazy
Its like 66Mhz computer webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth


etc


Just example

I bet users phone would agree
Sometimes,the phone gets stuck like computer doesnt store incoming call numbers

etc

If find better phone, I suggest go it
 

The Nokia 6600 far best phone ive ever much better Motorola MPX200 easy phone use would recomend phone anyone likes fratures Ipaq Reception T-Mobile

 heres Pros Cons Nokia 6600

Pros-1
 The bluetooth great nice range pretty fast2
 The infered nice Very Fast3
 Its pretty durable fast4
 The screen GREAT5
 The Symbian OS east use menues convient6
 The Battery life isnt bad people say


 frank accually quite good7
 The camera quite nice good resolution8
 THE SD MEMORY SLOT IS AMAZING GET A 1GB SD CARD AND FILL IT WITH UR MAVORITE SONGS AND MOVIES9
 The contacts easy manage10
 The phone works modem11
 This PHONE HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AT A GOOD PRICE GET IT (


)Cons-1
 The price little bit steap

 thats 

Though looks bit bulky side, (rather fat) cool fone
 The keypad bit congested fingers get tired typing message
 Browsing quite fast (depends network though)
 Apply themes phone looks rather nice
 One glitch support pop port
 Supports bluetooth IR
 Nokia seriously think putting games inside phone
 Samsung Sony easily scores Nokia regard
 The battery plus point nokia phones
 bluetooth consumes power like greedy pig
 I charge battery everyday
OVerall display great
 Camera ok
 launch 7610 might put camera poor category
 

I bought phone phones less-than-consistant reception
UPSIDE: This one, like Nokias, receives consistently strong signal (I've tried Samsung Sony Ericsson models weak reception front)
 I love Bluetooth; easy use wireless Jabra headset
 Photos pretty darned good
DOWNSIDE: It takes long time start up
 My last simpler Nokia started right immediately ready use
 The "movies" last 5 seconds
 I mean, they're short
 Why function can't film anything longer e seconds? I find feature phone useless, but, since I don't really need function anyway, I don't really use it
 Also, I dial "800" number like airline, allow use number keys navigatee prerecorded menu
 This MUST need get flight times, connect reservations, etc
 Finally, week's use, screen started freeze me
 It would hang calls
 Once froze bad I couldn't even use power button turn off, open take battery
Probably great phone overall, perhaps mine bugs
 But beware bugs; major
 

I used work t-mobile

 owned many phones v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205



 list go on
 far best phone right now
 yes bit large, realestate screen spoil you
 hard time using phones smaller screens


 OS abit confusing 1st, within days pass learning curve
 \I use phone quick dirty digital camera
 pics touched photoshop, printed 4x6 look great
 also use phone modem via bluetooth Apple powerbook
 The speed dail up, live wifi everywhere version catch up
 I used wireless internet almost everywhere travel works great
If apple isync address book numbers two places




 case lose phone (get INSURACE)the stand really good considering toys phone screen size
 would highly recommmend





 oh owned baby like 6 months 

The phone pretty nice
 Camera quality isn't bad low resolution
 Menu bit slow, overall, phone functional
But watch Amazon rebates (T-Mobile rebate fine)
 You wait get second bill send rebate form in
 Depending timing postmark date, don't get second bill postmark date passes, it's impossible qualify rebate
 

Its 11 months I've held Nokia 6600 for
 I purchased phone knowing slightly old compared newer models Nokia phones available
 I thought kind steeply priced time
 I must add dismay/delight readers phone simply groundbreaking phone mankind ever held
 It raised bar owing number features offers absolute ease use delight
Now I'm techy like getting technical things I'd brief features I liked phone-1
The Phone best keypad Nokia phone offer
 My dad Nokia 6670 Nokia 7210 Nokia 6610
 I think keypad cell phone important thing Im constantly sending messages , calling people fiddling around phone
 Believe I say I used fingered Nokia phones 6600 best keypad2
 The looks absolutely nonsensical
 Some complain tad bulky looking
 I must admit best looking phone ever look static absolute conviction looks like everything phone be3
 The Nokia 6600 brilliant Java interface
 There's whole lot things phone besides reading book , playing various Java games , variety software installed
 The Phone offers 32 Mb MMC card I think certainly exciting feature
 I upgraded mine 128 MB MMC Card via I store unlimited number messages, take thousand pictures videos
 Capacity problem here
4
 The Build right
 The phone sturdy
 I've dropped atleast dozen times recolletion still works good ever
 Its tough one unless wanna drive car it
 This isn't rugged phone ever gonna play aeroplane this,are you
5
The Camera installed phone awesome
 I click pictures JPG format phone bluetooth device I find extremely easy transfer pics pc forth
 The display brightness phone quite extraordinary
 The use 65536 (16bit) colors ensures get share animations icons phoneBesides mentioned Merits , phone decent ear volume loudspeaker functionality
 It great upgradibility
 I play MP3 files phone simply downloading softwares freely available net
 Now neat
 The log functions helps track incoming , outgoing calls easy ways
The handsfree provided phone useful talk phone driving
 I wouldn't it's worth life
Anyhow demerits phone,The phone slow processor ear volume lower 6610 6610 best ear volume among Nokia variants
The battery life phone 2 days least one day excessive use
 Video recording limited 9 seconds
 You upgrade there's certain level trouble involved
Overall I dont think I ever upgrade phone
 When I purchased phone , I thought I purchased popular phone around thought didn't please me
 In case , putting aside common city , I dont think I anymore satisfied
 This makes great phone
Did I mention note feature send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS
 

The Nokia 6600 really glorified 3650: know 3650, bulbous, formless, big phones unfortunate ATT customers carrying around
 The Nokia 660 runs Symbian OS, works pretty well standard phone fare, stuff intuitive, actually learn use all, there's plenty neat tie-ins
I've got mine point checks pop e-mail, I send videos photos straight contacts synced via Bluetooth Macintosh, I even control iTunes computer using great program called &quot;Sailing Clicker&quot;
 However, I doubt many people ever get far
The camera decent, videos fun pointless low quality short length, design phone much friendlier 3650
 The screen get scratched up, phone durable
 The battery life also decent
This cool phone know use it, but, casual phone user, I would wait Nokia really figure operating system
 If like phone can't stand size, wait Nokia 7610, 1
3 megapixel camera much standard, dare I say, svelte size
 

The size phone surprisingly bearable, thou big
 It fits jeans' pockets fine
The phone many cool features
 The picture quality pretty good phone
 The file size highest image quality setting around 40k each
 The phone comes 32MB MMC card plenty
 The negative MMC card buried underneath battery
 Nokia made it's easily accessible
The phone also ability capture view video
 That's pretty neat option
Instructions send pictures clear all
 I first tried emailing didn't work
 I call find TMobile support phone's email client
 However, email accounts another provider (other TMobile) familiar setting email accounts, able use email client
The default features came phone seem lacking compared siblings
 For example, comes two games
 Also automatic keyguard


 least can't found
The user menu negative phone
 It's clear go make changes settings
 Nokia needs spend time usability test phone
Battery life great
 It seems last two days
I would recommend phone Nokia 3620
 All all, good phone get used quirks
The TMobile folks helpful
 No problem time dealing them
 

Don't get wrong
 I love gadgets, technology whatever electronic equipment throw way
 I've gone almost every Nokia phone since known operational Europe
 In days I've gone Oki, Motorolla progressed (actually regressed) Sony Ericsson's T610
 Now I'm back Nokia try 6600 model
If haven't grown using Nokia mobile phones, may problem adapting &quot;new&quot; technological device
 Here skinny:Cons:1
 It's bulky
 How big thick it? We call BAR OF SOAP
 I want phone performs first foremost phone
 You equip many features, doesn't feel operate like basic phone doesn't deserve sold mobile phone
2
 User interface based Symbian - collaboration major mobile phone manufacturers
 Sadly, interface still extremely slow
 Think old computer dial-up connection wait pages load
 Yes, it's THAT SLOW
I still prefer Nokia's user interface - it's fast, efficient intuitive
 You don't need manual go thru menus
 Sadly, making products support Bluetooth without going Symbian OS route
Pros:1
 On plus side, Bluetooth works flawlessly Apple PowerBook iBook Panther OS
 It syncs data Address Book iCal - even pictures whatever data I throw it
2
 It surfs net get optional service mobile provider
 I download go various sites MapQuest I need know go State
 Although slow surf, don't expect DSL speeds here
3
 It numerous features Java games applications add according needs
4
 It expandable external memory card, I already added 128MB hold data built-in camera, video sound recorder
5
 Because built Symbian platform supports Java, virtually expandable
The problem tons features phone half-baked cool fucntional ideas
 There lots kinks work size bulkiness phone horrendous
With latest Symbian OS, built latest phones, it's disappointing
 Maybe future, improve interface
 Until I'm going back latest Nokia phones Symbian
My advice pass phone continue using existing Nokia phone
 Wait kinks worked invest next phone come next year
 

I got 1GB MMC upgrade phone I can:1
 Record around 1 hour video Phillips Camcorder Pro
2
 Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures
3
 Play Java games it
4
 Play N-Gage games it
5
 Check traffic411
com LA traffic 405
6

 Connected phone tablet pc access company VPN 56k speed via bluetooth
Clear call logs speed phone people


As bluetooth, problems all
 I've connected phone two laptops iPaq 4155
 Very simple painless
 

I've using phone 3 days now, I admit seems doesn't seem like long -- I also point I've using almost non-stop
 Frankly, I think one niftiest pieces hardware I've ever used
 It slow initially start up, it's turned on, I've never complaints speed
 Over past three days, I've turn phone twice, I rarely deal delay initially booting phone
Everything, far, worked flawlessly
 I've synched PC bluetooth
 I've synched Jabra 250 bluetooth headset
 I've phone, browsing net GPRS connection, sending text message
 All time, without hitch
I think interface great
 I actually purchased two phones recently (this one new Blackberry phone), one far superior (IMHO)
In short, I don't single negative thing say
 I love features, interface, size (the screen delight), camera (though I admit I'm much camera user -- toy me), internet connectivity, quality, etc
If I over, I wouldn't buy anything else
 

I find difficult remove back cover plan spare battery replace I suggest don't ,besides long battery life
 Im able keep phone week (mostly stand by) three days (regular use)The phone self looks sleek elegant also durable, iv dropped mine several (the screen scratches easy put inn purse full things little ones ) times gotten water still working condition far
Files phone organized want organize folders option, similar folders PC
 The thing youre organized might take forever get photo want openWhen save numbers save multiple numbers option home bussiness mobile different icon add email address pictures birthdays info, one constantly forgets stuff useful youThe camera good quality compared smaller models needs light good photos
 The night mode brightens pictures makes photo texture bit streaky dots brightening picture
If going get phone record video clips sound clips -don't extremely disappointed short video clips (9 sec=94 kb) short sound clips (1 min) picks background noise may sound garbled times
The thing recorder would seem useful personalize ring tones even recording own, I one brothers tells anser phone would throw something (in profane words) , friend one story long story doesn't make sense middle book annoying could probably favorite book quote 
 The phone also supports real media , upload REAL SONG (I thing 
wav im sure)When lot files phone gets very, slow 
 This solved transferring files memory card
The WAP so-so, handy emergencies saved butt , debate school research missing I able look google instances downloading ring tones etc slowthe calendar list note functions similar palm pilot
 I haven't tried voice commands it's similar voice tag feature nokia phones
overall nokia squeezed ton features , skimped quality bit , mean fantastic okay 

Although first mobile phone, Excellent phone almost features anybody expect normal mobile phone
 I really impressed Quality phone
 

This best camera cell phone ive ever had

the camera quality really good

speaker phone loud much nokia 6610

i recomend phone buyers price

the bad thing videos recorded 10seconds although 32mb memory card included

that doesnt make sense dont know cant take videos longer 10 seconds 

Excellent battery life, good quality pictures, signal strength poorer compared previous phone (Nokia 3595)
 I recently bought father lives low signal area
 He used 1 2 bars 6600 seems signal whatsoever
 Don't get wrong, excellent phone make sure don't signal problems live
 My apartment good signal strength I definitely buy phone myself
 

This good phone
 People say slow, slow irritating
 Do get cover phone else easily scratched
 The camera good
 Havent tried bluetooth yet
 You need think twice getting phone
 All buddies impressed phone
 It every feature u need
 Its short phone, shorter pics see amazon
 Little thick yes, disturbing either
 The keypad also good
 It may good enough frequent messaging, dialing good
 Go get it









 

facilities 

 also big screen reasonable clarity

 it's shape odd look hard handle it

 difficult catch phone dail number's one hand

 use hand's use worst part phone 

At first glance, I thought phone little big me, maybe little complicated
 One minute salesman I sold
 This thing everything washes dishes
 I use modem computer, connect clients friends, possibilities endless
 The ringtones beautiful, screen super high quality
 I could go on---but I won't
 Go see yourself
 The ONLY bad thing? I NOT find carrier phone I like, end tossing purse
 

A definite buy
 This great phone comfortable size it's user friendly
 Its battery could last bit longer, it's minor detail compared features phone gives you
 Nokia didn't miss thing
As service provider T-Mobile always given best service
 

While buttons close together causing hit wrong key bit slow - good phone
 No real problems
 It seems it's discontinued - what


 

Ive Nokia 6600 3 weeks ive learned easy use yet wide range options
 If looking motorola MPX200 would reccomend motorola plus nokia t-mobile phone get much better reception
-Your feandly nokia user :) 

phone alot unctions love it
i recomend anyone
 

I got phone yesterday didn't find problems yet
 Picture video quality ok
 Love speaker phone
 

Hand set good, aware T-MOBILE rebate
 These people takes lest effort process rebate forms
 For last one month Rebate status showing rebate apporved check delivered still I waiting Check
 There way talk customer care this
Dont rely T-Mobile rebates
 

bought phone 16 months ago lot problems phone , call (because says call allowed ,it happens 10-15 times day), doesnt show recent call logs (sometimes),if u drop ground takes big damages(too soft body),etcgood sides battery life,and looks nice ,and lots system tools 

Previous reviews helpful accurate
 One main reasons I bought phone download music onto MMC
 I can't figure this, though
 I called Nokia Support informed I "audio program" change current mpeg format one compatible RealOne player
 They could elaborate further
 Needless say, I need additional guidance since I'm computer savvy
 (Could someone help me? eugarte@yisd
net) If I could figure use great features, I would much happier phone
 

Nokia good reputation phone brought down
 The battery doesn't stay mentioned specification
 The Camera great
 

According survey, customers ordering cell phone service AMAZON
COMBut one customers contributing this, big mistake
 I ordered 2 "cell phone + service"s Amazon
 The first shipment took long time, I cancel it
 The second one hold almost 2 weeks message "Can delayed further"
 So order one top 10 bestselling phones Amazon now, take least 3 weeks shipment delivered


guess Amazon waiting seconds re-package, 

This phone one best I've ever used
 It everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support MMC, camera, good operating system lots supporting software
 

Great trade-up Nokia 3650
 And reference &quot;A wireless customer Providence, RI, United States&quot;'s comments, Bluetooth
 How miss it? 

This top notch Nokia, I've seen models thing better Mp3 ringtone thing
This phone classy, elegant, best reception ever

I use USA Mexico work, signal always optimum, even road
Plus, resolution amazing, functions real easy use
And besides, seen Celular Movie, tell everyone thats phone

 

I owned Phone last week , performance good

Nokia keeps getting better
 Excellent voice quality battery life
 One first things I noticed despite small size, newly designed shape makes grip much better
Nokia best menu software phone makers
 Downside remains candybar design, although works great me
 Also missing bluetooth
 At $299, phone little pricey
 

best phone met far 

need softwear international mobile phone works nigeria,as softwear trypical cell phone works united state one works nigeria country
 

This may really cool phone, it's worth T-Mobile
 They worst service major companies
 I really regret signing T-Mobile, I'm stuck next 6 months contract
 If you're looking new company, don't fooled service plans
 T-Mobile's minute plans cheaper reason

I would like sell phone


 

At time One best phones T-MobilePro's- Great display
 Nice Look Feel- Lot features- You get lot free stuff phone
- You get free IM Messenger (agile) login favorite IM like MSN, Yahoo , AOL, ICQ



- There lot softwares there
- You send receive emails using 6600 email client, really tough get work
 Check allaboutsymbian
com help
 Call T-Mobile tech level 3 support
- Reception Quality goodCon's- You got manage battery life
 (Disable bluetooth using)- You got use hands, Have get used keys
 People big fingures going problem
 

My recommendation buy phone T-mobile without asking phone discontinued soon
 That's happened phone
 After I bought phone I lot troubles
 First, Lock code error
 Every time I tried enter code, gave error
 The phone also wasn't vibrating constantly shutting down
 T-mobile didn't exchange phone don't carry phone anymore
 (Probably lot problems model) The frustrating part even though phone warranty one year, refuse replace phone equivalent phone
I ended sending phone Nokia's repair center
 They fixed lock code error, stopped vibrating again
 And still shutting down
 I must say overall good features
 The camera quality good joystick easy use
However, despite phone's features, I problems I mentioned above
 Maybe phone still happening
 Plus, operation slow
T mobile terrible customer service
 

Beautiful screen, nice dimensions, found easy set use (This first Nokia)
The speakerphone option seems quite good well
The minor worries -- Protecting screen effectively scratching- Keys bit smaller side (Too much typing comfortable)Overall, absolutely great buy
 

This phone flashy feels good hand, could hold connection bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, desktop computer)
 My old Siemens s56, hand, worked beautifully above
If hunt around web, find many websites people complaining lack drivers phone cavelike silence Nokia asked help
If needs limited making phonecalls taking snapshots, phone probably satisfy you
 If need Bluetooth, stay away
 

I waiting finish 1 year contract get phone
 find bad reviews 6600
 let tell folks awesome phone
 I Palmone T3 really good time now
 neeed try sync option soon
 much satisfied
 giving 4 stars cause keys placed little odd
 thanks nokia 

Most thew reviews high phone 





 My explanation reviewers americans live states 




 difference : recently GSM networks wide scale , cell network companies supplied consumers cells , middle east (for example) stopped using years ago 



 So wonder lot people find 6600 miracle 
I purchased 6600 first released The Middle East , almost month Europe , reading brochures features , really sound like true all-in-one functionality monster 
Unfortunately , I sold exactly month later 
1-A cell phone make CALLS , words , quality reception mic/speaker important , 6600 relatively low volume speaker , you'd press hard ear hear anything person saying , unless surroundings completely quiet 
2- It bulky small buttons sides sloppy use 
3- It SLOW , keep original configuration progs (why'd u buy ?
) it'll run smoothly , still slower coloured-screen Nokias 
 As soon copy video/audio files add programs games , WILL hang least 5-10 times day 
A firmware upgrade irrelevant 
4- My idea all-in-one , theory -once again- proves wrong , phone excells nothing , less average everything , seriously need "other phone" functionalities , you'll disappointed 



 lots money bought love gadgets fine 



 don't expect get much done 
5- If already girlfriend and/or wife , won't need Bluetooth lol 
Basically 6600 bundle over-hyped features don't won't need (if get PDA pocket PC) , none work , basic phone functions ergonomics less average 
I'm advocate Nokia , phone following models (7610) , seemingly desperate trial squeezing much under-engineered experimental technologies one sloppy phone 
I'm giving 1 star compared Nokia phones , 1 , compared blunders companies (such samsung motorrola) might good 



 you're getting Nokia , don't get one 
 

I using phone 4 months find menus slow respond
 You practically hit call button wait display call history
 The software slow respond
 Most features phone arent useful all
 The keys pretty good I really didnt like all
 

I trying various phones past 6 weeks replace 3650 ATT finally decided try 6620
 I've tried Palm treo, V600 new blackberry TMobile found Palm blackberry complex I'm looking for
 I need good organizer ability synch Outlook
 Is much ask without buy extra components Motorola requires? I think not
 I've using 6620 week took 4 days get synch Outlook (USB IR) 90mins phone Nokia support
 I finally got synch I thought, ok I sit back relax next year contract I'll search next new phone
Unfortunately plan chill be
 This phone frozen twice already (the problem 3650)
 I assured folks stores due old Symbian OS bugs 6600 series newer improved OS find similiar problems 6620
 mentioned several reviews OS slow, freezes glitchy
 I really want keep phone like cool features plus free synching software I'm sure trade worth time aggravation put issues
 If V600 came USB cable free software, I would go phone
anyway, purchase risk
 

It took tad longer learn phone's full capabilities, features well worth money
 As American living 3rd world country I need phone I rely give great connections phone that
(And think phone slow open programs, try paying bucks upgrade memory 64 MB more, I think you'll find everything works fine
) With MMS/GPRS technology I sent dozens pitures videos yahoo email address get FAST
 (I upgraded 128mb memory chip mine) I travel alot I rely litle dynamo take pretty nice photos
 (and no, I dont work Nokia Amazon
com) 

This one good looking
 It's oval and


 nice
 I like it's shape it's keypad joystick
 It's easy use
 Not small, big
 The screen quite big (between handphone), 65000 color
 And, else, camera still VGA
I must say, one quite slow open application
 Sometimes, needs minutes open application
 What's wrong it? Is really slow, what?Few month ago, it's popular among community
 It's good
 But good enough me
 :
OK, score 7
0Oh yes, newest color phone quite cool
 

Overall great phone
 However, screen easily scratched
 If purchase phone, leave plastic protector screen, purchase protective case
 My screen scratched within week
 

I got need nokia GSM camera-phone speakerphone
 3660 similar features, big size
 6600 looks feels nice
This one full features(has bluetooth)
 Especially LCD big camera quality among best around
 I set it's PDA features avantgo
com download info sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions it, great
 Using supplied s/w, transfer addresses different nokia phone it
Goes ~3 days charge
 

Sure, relatively bulky, really packed many great features
 I phone 6 months now, I used following features: bluetooth connection laptop desktop sync contacts calendars Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I many movies 512MB memory card takes
 Bought bluetooth headset works like wonder
 Handsfree future good, exciting
 Camera nice, video recording reason limited 9 seconds
Only thing I don't like slow changing apps, boot up, sometime problem connect thru bluetooth
 

I've Nokia's years, one packed whiz bang features disappointing primary use - phone
Before buying, I'd urge actually use one handle store
On plus side it's packed features, including BlueTooth works fine - it's really tiny computer also phone


 that's negative
 As computer, PDA weak since screen, large phone standards, still tiny really anything on
And remember, PHONE first foremost I biggest complaints


When dial number, you'll need check screen see number entered correct
 You'll keys tightly packed fingers likely press two keys once
I hope magnifying glass, number displayed well pop options tiny
It's though Nokia segregated 90% screen fancy features rarely used leave 10% day day use
I've many Nokia's best features, it's worst phone
Sorry, try something else least trying using one
 You'll see I mean 


 magnifying glass
 

I bought 2 Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru amazon market place
 Initially phones fun play cool features like speaker phone, web browser ofcourse built camera
 So whole, let summarize good bad things phone, instead writing long review
The good:1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution
2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception
3) Joy stick eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card store pictures stuff
Now bad:1) As usual, battery power sufficient daily usuage
 The battery power discharges rapidly especially using web browser
2) Phone awfully slow
 Sometimes press buttons, menu appears second two
3) Phone kinda heavy, small size
 Looks big display ads though
4) Buttons quite small really pain exp one fond text messaging
 There much erasing text as, one would tend type something instead actual letters
5) Video recorder use one cannot record something useful 10 seconds takes send &quot;Free picture video messaging&quot; offered service provider
So review defintely give idea phone
 The bottom line &quot;Phone cool one - moment, latest phone market new features, soon displaced upcoming newer phones&quot;
 

This phone fantastic
 Great reception, visibility interface (may complicated others)
 Just don't get drawn T-Mobile's catchy rebate
 T-Mobile wasn't upfront terms qualify rebate
 

This phone cool
 The phone bit big stubby little hard navigate one hand
PROS: good memory capacity, good camera quality, good reception, comfortable hand, menu items organizable, loud monophonic ringtones, auto phone-lock, add-on programs, nifty little 5-way joystick, loud clear speakerphone, personalized ringtones, good sound recorder, doesn't drops calls
CONS: odd design, memory card/battery issue, screen easy scratch, slow loading, polyphonic HiFi tones arent loud clear, WAP connection slow, low refresh rate video recorder, auto-keylock, settings unorganized
The annoying thing phone settings phone place, 1 file
 Overall deserves 4-star rating
 No less
 

Before I bought phone, I read several reviews statingthat display scratched easily
 I kept inmind tried baby phone
 After phonefor 3 days, I put two big scratches display witha plastic badge small piece metal it
 I wasshocked easily screen scratched
 Amazon wouldn'treplace phone I scratched (not faulting them)
So careful phone
 

The Nokia 6600 colorful screen easy use menus
 The battery life okay lithium-ion battery
 You change face plates get sick color currently store multiple phone numbers per contact name addition details address, company, etc
 The downside phone it's big/fat loading menu options slow
 However, sturdy phone compared 'smart phones' decent job
 ;-) I replacing new razr one since razr total lemon
 

I love phone, great
 I upgraded phone old 3650 died
 What I happy T-mobile service
 I likely never going try watch movie small screen amazing applications availible phone
 The display large ledgible, keys little confusing great improvement old 3650
I always Nokia customer, shame much phones performance relies service provider
 

I replaced Motorola V66 6600
 The V66 dropped time, 6600 never
 The camera easy use
 It's easy program, bluetooth
 I paid $79 T-mob
 This phone loud, programable, works great, robust
 Good stuff
 

I've phone couple weeks, overall I'm pretty impressed features it
 I happen area T-Mobile service really strong, dropped calls, much better sounding Nextel I dumped - I think antennas phone itself
 It slightly bigger phone others there, slightly - personally, I find nicely balanced, comfortable
 The sound best I've experienced quite phones, I haven't played many features, camera works well intended use - isn't SLR, don't expect results
About drawback I see screen bit washed bright sunlight, even adjusting brightness itI bought two them, recommend anyone
 Maybe perfect every way, I think individual preferences user phone itself
 

I fan Nokia since long time
 This fifth Nokia far
 This phone awesome screen nice camera (better I seen ever cell phone)
 The drawback install themes tends get slower
 The connectivity features worked smoothly me
 All phone worth buying
 To quiet honest best available US Market right now
 

This phone one milestones history cellular phones
 Supporting operating system, Symbian OS, download run lot programs phone
 You turn phone gaming machine, camcorder digital camera, mp3-player, movie viewer, voice recorder, personal secretary, GPS map browser, book, multifunction remote controller, practically everything computer, plus phone(

) also carry pocket :)
 Many programs shareware, purchased paying little bit bucks
 It uses extendable MMC memory, perfect storing videos, pictures mp3s
Its nice look also plus
 And also, since tri band since uses SIM-card, use Europe many parts world, wherever GSM exists
I love phone, especially using primitve phone 3 years
 

The n6600's strong points 1) Symbian OS, 2) memory, 3) screen quality brightness, 4) PIM sync Outlook
 I needed replace PDA wanted smaller phone Treo 600 preferably good camera
Unfortunately


 1) included WAP browser almost *never* connects via t-zones (need Opera browser instead), 2) setting email took days trial error, 3) MP3's require third-party app MONO, stereo would implied
In US, T-Mobile supports phone coverage good Verizon's
This phone good toy, I've yet see all-time killer phone-to-have (with flawless coverage)


 

I really love phone


 I also loving T-Mobile (100 times better ATT


 actually talk real person support hour
)
I think phone great power-user (check http://www
psiloc
com/ great toys
), due wide-body (this phone FAT) over-abundence features really isn't everyone
 Is great someone wants something near-PDA
Pictures turn OK, don't count replacing digicam
I love phone ultrabig screen
 I highly recommend getting bluetooth usb adapter sync phone bluetooth wireless headset
 

great phonei phone since Feb 04 never problem all
very cool features


 great camera zoom


cool quality pictures


 great ringtones


 bluetooth feature great



 

Nokia 6600 used PDA
 With Symbian OS install tons software real music
 I love phone
 Lets see kind phone Nokia going come next
 

The phone excellent great features
 Apart bulky, I find anything wrong phone
 

Positives: Bluetooth, IR port, VGA Camera, multiple e-mail accounts, speaker phone, programs becoming available Symbian O/S
 I use Bluetooth wireless headset make phone serve wireless modem
Negatives: phone big; voice recognition worthless, low volume ear piece, IR port weak TV remote control programs don't work well, slow menu's response
 Get Opera browser phone come since WAP browser frustrate (Opera problems phone, works time)
 T-Mobile programmed backlight display turn seconds, although Nokia made adjustable, T-Mobile won't fix it
 

I've phone almost year nothing great use
 I connect computer via bluetooth transfer images, calender events, contacts anything else
 Another great feature anyway ability load 
wav sounds ringers
 This way I never ripped carrier stupid ringtones, I get whatever I want
 The downside I found phone bit slow react, meaning I push contacts button, takes load, true almost menus programs phone
 Other that, simbian series 60 OS great offers lots proprietary software work phone you're willing hunt it
 

Pros:- Nokia Series 60 OS - Intuitive stable - allows install 3rd party applications, ring tones, themes- Large screen- Ability add 1GB memory, although 32MB Secure Digital comes store quite bit- The ability customize every aspect phone- Audio quality speakerphone excellent- Battery life great considering features- Works great iSync Mac PowerBook G4 (OS 10
3
7)- BluetoothCons- Buttons small - send/end buttons take getting used to- Slow power (though shouldn't need power often) 

I use Nokia 6600, great color TFT display camera equipped zoom, complement built-in video recorder audio RealOne player playback streaming 3GPP-compatible RealMedia video clips
Multimedia functions enhanced multi-slide MMS messages Gallery organizing digital content captured downloaded phone
So, I recommend 6600? Yes, certainly
 But market new business capable phone, don't want deal stylus equipped PDA like device P900, 6600 probably suit fine
The Nokia 6600 decent extension smartphone line
 The phone advantages excellent keypad display, long rundown time good software suite
 Among weak points MMC slot location bit vague design
 In short, Nokia 6600 evolution revolution
 

This first cell phone I've owned, overall, I quite pleased it
 I purchased phone researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's T-Mobile compatiable
 Among requirments phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, GPRS support
 The 6600 best phone I could find options I could get t-mobile
One primary reason getting cell phone I could use internet connection laptop running linux, softmodem drivers hard find, don't work well
 If using Linux, want use GPRS connect net, I suggest phone along Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter
For linux users intrested setup:I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3
4) custom 2
6
7 kernel
On DELL Inspiron 8200 P4 2
0ghz system 1gb RAM
The KDE Bluez system bluetooth support
I really enjoyed camera phone
 Although images best world, handy camera everywhere go
 And phone cool feature wich allows send images via normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account
 I also say setting e-mail account simple straight-forward, although need external SMTP server use
The phone use MIDI audio file ringtone
 Which really nice get pretty much piece music MIDI format free net
 You use OBEX File Transfer service bluetooth linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds nice intergration Konqueror this) sending files phone
The fact assign ringtones people and/or groups really cool
 Apparently phones don't allow give entire group ringtone
I say OS phone runs issues
 Sometimes, various applications crash
 Especially bluetooth server


 Meaning restart phone want bluetooth work again
 This somewhat annoying, working computers (espcially windows -- ugh


) I'm used restart things
 On average, I prolly restart phone every two days
I use phone exculsivly Jabra Freespeak 250
 I really dislike holding phone ear, I've found Freespeak comfortable easy use phone
 The main drawback fact voice-dialing system kinda picky
 It takes learn use right, point I able make 70% calls using it
 However, needs quite quiet work -- dosn't work car, example
Some people commented size weight phone, rightfully gotten nick-name "the bar soap" which, really is
 But use bluetooth accessories, I do, really issue
All all, great phone
 Especially price amazon gives (I unable get mine amazon due credit complications)
 If use linux want GRPS and/or want use handsfree bluetooth device, want decent camera -- phone you
 

What I found useful consider purchasing phone:- decent battery life- good call quality- user-friendly interface- camera/video functions- bluetooth- ability sync contacts stored PC phone (no manual entries
)With one intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync Microsoft Outlook, support thousands applications Symbian platform phone runs (I IR Remote, ICQ others), Nokia 6600 - one phones T-Mobile claim distinction
 Ive phone year - best phone I owned
 The con I think lack mega-pixel camera
Motorola's phones well engineered user interface reflects poorly otherwise excellent engineering company
Its real shame T-Mo offer newer Nokia models
 

INCREDIBLE MEMORY
 Aside 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's 32MB MMC card goes it
 Picture quality's great still video sound
 record voice turn ringtone
 can't Sony T610 (which traded 6600)
 T610 supports midi files
 N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc
 handsfree loudspeaker, conference transfer
 i'm mine upgraded capture endless video, right allows 10 secs
 I'll buy bigger MMC card course
 I love phone
 

*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****In October 2003, I bought Nokia 3650 eBay
 It OK phone really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, cool applications
 It major step Sony t68i
 The 3650--being essentially mini-computer--had memory leaks occassional crashing, nothing quick power cycle couldn't help
 Most importantly, allowed get Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly
 It's nice phone, I'm glad used it
In July 2004, I purchased Nokia 6600 T-Mobile
 Since I use Palm PDA T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked sales representative I could use phone Bluetooth modem Palm, said yes
 So I bought phone went merry way
BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE
 THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE
 Though nearly dozen different people T-Mobile Nokia told otherwise, simply possible use phone Bluetooth modem vast majority PDAs many devices
 While two devices pair, phone immediately drop connection data transferred
 With recent "bluejacking" vunerability, Bluetooth overseers created new security system called Combination Key
 This helps prevent people sending short "obscene" messages phone
 The older security method called Unit Key
 Most Bluetooth devices support older security system, Unit Key
 This includes ALL Palm PDAs
 Further, due unparalled design oversight, Nokia device supports Combination Key NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE older devices people actually own
 Does sound technical? That's is, way I learned spending hour talking T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians South Africa (to learn problem wasn't T-Mobile) three hours getting nowhere Nokia support technicians reading endlessly scripts, never deviating, I started cursing got tier-2 tech
 Only I learn truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS
So, frustration adding newest contacts 6600, I asked technician possible transfer data 6600 3650
 He advised back 6600 newly formatted Nokia MMC card, restore data 3650
 I followed technician's directions letter phone, I done so, phone restarted displayed message "Phone startup failed
 Contact retailer
" I spent hour talking tier-2 technician told tier-1 technician known possible backup 6600 3650 safely condition
 I could get 3650 working even factory defaults, even trying every reset code could muster
 Nokia finally determined phone need repair, since warranty (it made May '03 would take eBay purchase proof) refused fix phone less $120
 After two hours placed hold persuasion, supervisor finally agreed fix phone free
I little research discovered repair could done basic cell-phone $30
 All done restore software phone, took cable Nokia software
 I still decided send phone, since insured shipping $10
Two weeks later I mailed phone repair
 Two days received phone, I received letter mailbox stating I pay $120 repair phone, would returned unrepaired
 I called Nokia try get sorted out, stated recollection ever promising repair phone free
 They stated though simple repair would less $120
 I suggested didn't make sense send phone repair I thought Nokia would charge $120 repair since I could get done locally $30
 This simple nuance much Nokia, still refuse acknoledge fact technician could broken phone repair phone free
 The supervisor stated must third-party applications 6600 caused 3650 break, would take suggestion tier-2 technicians stated possible back 6600 3650 without damaging 3650, regardless 6600
In short - Nokia don't know phone doesn't work Palm, don't heed advice spend hours technicians around globe reading scripts, chiding broken english following directions exactly
 You also hard-reset Palm Nokia factory defaults lame attempts get script work, though not
 Ultimately learn bad Nokia is, recent loss market share utterly deserved
 

I bought phone months ago I using since then
 I never single problem
 It Nokia thus easy acces menu options
 High quality video pictures rock
 3 band change SIM card able use Europe another service provider
 Bottom line great phone time being
 

Pros1
 Big Display2
 Most functions available


(I write 10+ points this, I telling one line)3
 Built Antenna helps lot signal strength4
 Can store around 400 photosCons1
 Little slow


 means key pushed, feel time taking come up2
 Most ring tones given Nokia low volume, chances missing calls (Best way keep vibration on)3
 When video used, battery getting discharged fast4
 Its little big (Small Soap Box), better previous Nokia
Just normal user buy without even thinking



If u looking use video frequently, I don't think phone matured enough, b'coz battery life



 

Have Nokia 6600 year generally happy T-Mobile
 It offers way features I need ones I use work well
 I almost always get good strong signal, even fairly remote areas southwest
 The sound quality excellent speaker phone couldn't easier use
 I like size shape
 It fits comfortably hand pocket
 The problem size keys
 My fingers kind stubby took learn hit key without hitting adjacent ones
 They really awfully small
 Also battery life isn't great it's sufficient needs
 It also works fine international calls
 It's bit pricey call home countries instant messaging covered countries Europe quite reasonable
 It's really well made survived sliding across floors pavement without scratch
I've nothing good luck T-Mobile
 Their customer service agents always prompt polite service terrific
 I never get dropped calls
 It seems much user friendly company Verizon thousand percent better horrible Quest Wireless
I recommend T-Mobile Nokia 6600 without reservation
 

bought phone last march, almost year ago, saudi arabia (it came here)
 since then, found one major problem it
 highly recommend looking phone great camera quality and/or lots features would find PDA
 

I love phone , It handy lot features 
 

This phone nice blend features without going overboard
 I using Motorola T720i Verizon I alot dropped calls I troubles syncing data
 I looking phone synced Mac OSX using Bluetooth, decent battery life, could check email, good reception, nice screen size durable (I break often break small gadgets)The interface simple use
 I saw complaints load time menus I feel people over-exaggerating menu load time
 I couple hundred contacts menu loads within seconds, big deal
 I notice turn phone OS takes bit load initially menus slower phone booted menus reasonably quicker
The camera adequate I want high-res photos I'll use digital camera instead
 On T-Mobile service I able take pics drove across I-70 email family & friends reached T-Mobile tzone (usually major city)
 Outside T-Mobile service area phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T; Wireless various services T-Mobile service unavailable
As I drove across country I lost reception eastern Kentucky's mountains
 Along way compared wife's T720i 6600 superior terms battery life, connectivity bars features
For Mac OSX users there, iSync works fairly well
 On occasion I'm able connect phone iSync via Bluetooth I found rebooting phone seems solve problem
 And Bluetooth drain battery quick I thought would, I usually go 1
5 days Bluetooth along making calls I need full recharge
 With Bluetooth phone last almost twice long
 

The title pretty much says all
 The photos address book terribly scaled too; look though built legos

number one criteria new phone iSync compaibility via bluetooth
 features gravy
 checked iSync compatibility page listed--they even photo 6600 shown graphic
so, right box issue
 namely, wouldnt sync
 scouring various boards find arbitrary pervasive problem
 lengthy hacks offered requiring root access edits via terminal
 may 10 years ago, want phone works point
 guess fault researching buying thing
 but, quite unhappy nokia moment
 looking phone integrate easily sonyericsson phones iSync, say stick sonyericsson
 i'd rather little phone t610 offers
 but, that's SE t-mobile offers right now
this nokia going back china wherever came from
 zero-star rating would give it
 

THIS IS A GREAT PHONE, 1ST OFF-I HEARD ALOT OF REVIEWS SAYING THERE IS NO LOCK KEY TO ACTIVATE, THERE IS
I HAVENT HAD ALOT OF TIME TO USE ALL OF THE TOYS YET ON THIS PHONE, BUT THEN AGAIN MY PRIORITIES ARE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN MOST
 OVERALL IT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY, AND NICE TO NAVIGATE WITH THE "JOYSTICK" BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE
 IT WAS A GREAT BUY, AND RECEPTION IN MY AREA IS PERFECT, I DO ALOT OF DRIVING AND WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT THE QUALITY, NOT ANY MORE



10,10,10






 

This phone may seem alittle bit dummy features hasis magnificent
 With price $ -30 nobody beat deal
 Symbian OS gives unlimited abilities phone
 If little bit knowledge use phone PDA, mp3 player, portable movie player, unlimited voice video recorder, portable gaming machine, fax machine, digital camera, GPS, way cell phone
 

The cell phone many features good want use purposes besides making receiving calls
Watch Amazon's rebates though
 Its hard get mail-in rebate Amazon accept responsibility contracted department third party
 

This phone DOA I got it
 Amazon sent another one(right away, next day UPS


), The second phone I received, dead pixel found LCD screen



Am I bad luck what????Then, I used take pics, resolutions I expected



However, sound quality superior


 I love RealOne player built-in phone(Just play Mp4, play MP3)
 Also, comes digital voice recoder, I think handy
 

I tell why,1
 Checking email road- I like email access yahoo &amp; corporate account
 I found 6600 got quite neat interface &amp; serves purpose (setup requires reading)
 It's fast expect
 Still, better first Windows 95 computer
2
 WAP/Internet compatible phone- I like check news, stock quotes, login messenger I road :) This phone got inbuilt WAP browser
 You buy cool applications support logging multiple messenger service (msn, yahoo &amp; aol)
3
 Large screen- Ofcourse screen size comforting
 It made old b/w palm obsolete
4
 Customizable user interface (Theme, Sounds, Wallpaper) &amp; applications- Not boring old look time, download free themes internet
 I already got 10+ themes

 This awesome
 Fresh look every week
- You load tons applications angel
 PDF READER, OPEN OFFICE, OPERA BROWSER, TONS OF GAMES, GPS


 ETC
 ETC (make sure load apps MMC memory phone - makes phone drag)
5
 Decent camera- This phone takes real decent pictures
 I like digital zoom features (not great, works me)
 I bought PhotoImpact application supports taking large resolution pictures
 Now I missing event


 Every team lunch &amp; happy hour logged

 There video recorder I don't use much


 Because, records short
6
 MMC Card- Im loving it
 I got space limitations
 I got 126mb there


 I done half nearly 200+ hi-res pictures, 10+ applications 10+ PDF documents
BOTTOM LINE, You never regret buying phone
 Unless, want FASSST phone without lot mentioned features
 

I'm sure read specs see everything does, best thing I easily check email, movie times, news, website phone
 You take pic friends picture pop call
 Give friend different ringtone
 Get great themes wallpapers phone many many polyphonic rings
 A huge beautiful color screen scratched even rough handling give it
 Nokia makes great phones, one cream crop
 Best phone i've ever owned, period
 

This good phone, especially like Nokia vs
 Motorola, want PDA functionality don't mind slight bulk
 I phone week, it's much better previous phones -- earlier Nokia top-notch Motorola/Nextel
 First, phones
 My previous Nokia phone only
 Little else
 The Motorola disappointing
 Clunky, poorly built cords accessories
 I replace in-car cord twice broke
 Motorola doesn't build quality phones
 Period
 Now phone, I think well built
 It's extremely solid
 Takes good photos video
 And best part it, me, sync Outlook allow carry calendar, contacts, etc
 PC
 I sync laser, sync bluetooth computer (mine doesn't)
 Takes less minute
 Sound quality strong far T-Mobile service better Nextel ATT service S
 Florida
 

I owned several cell phones years, including Motorola's Sony/Ericsson
 Most recent Motorola MPx200 (worst phone ever)from work, wife still uses S/E T68i
While I agree reviews, hard use PDA, keys bit small, I find phone comfortable hold use, everything I need PDA standpoint (holding contacts calender info)
The reason phone best cell I ever owned boils simple things, forever frustrated phones, I wonder I ever put them
1
 Reception outstanding
 I put 6600 wife's T68i right next other; I get crystal clear reception, drops call call
2
 Speakerphone excellent
 I never drive cell phone next ear anymore
 Sound quality superb speaker, mic good one even tell I using speakerphone unless I driving 75 windows down
3
 Battery life impressive
 If I forget take charger weekend away, oh well
 I usually get 5 days single change, although I fairly light user
 

To fair first phone I've owned
 Resisted middle last year I looked buy phone one I chose reviews models I looked at
I keep left pocket time use left hand
 I'm right handed, I issues ergonomics
 I like look clamshell phones upon trying store, flimsy feeling small hands (I'm 5'11 medium build)
The screen good, large mobile sharp
 The camera ok snapshots, video limited 9 seconds third party apps take long fit memory
I use alarm clock morning, I set calendar and/or clock remind meetings, things do, etc
 work course tells time (I don't wear watch)
It also good calculator conversion tool lengths/weights/etc
 I use work - I work large corporation I'm constantly move
It Realplayer built in, it's supposed doesn't play 
WMV formats
 I don't use MP3 player much I UltraMP3 installed works well looks good
 The sound loudspeaker decent phone output headphones mono
I've problems phone side Bluetooth
 It works flawlessy, said PCs USB adaptor
For calling receiving calls, I would say it's average cell phone terms clarity signal strength
 Of course depends provider
 T-Mobile ok, I real problems never go 300 peak mins month
The best recommendation I give is, I dropped (harder it's already dropped) broke, I'd buy another one, newest model it, next day
 

I've beauty nearly 2 months I truely love it
 The disappointment far battery life
 Mine generally requires charege every 48 hours I don't really talk much
Why phone great? Simple
 It all
 This first phone I know large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector speakerphone
If looking upgrade, definitely phone you
 

The nokia 6600 great phone, good games, good camera
 The video recorders bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs recordings, sometimes I get 17
 The voice recorders good, can't record songs radio ring tones
The games decent, u get 2 start with
 But download really good ones like pac-man mafia wars
Overall phones fantastic, I would given 5 stars, perfect
 If looking phone thats mainly calls killing time one want
 The battery mine lasts 2 days I don't play games much, takes 90 mins charge flat
 This phone best battery, lasts longer old 3210 

I bought two phones - one wife one me
 I signed T-Mobile 1K + Nights Weekends
 First T-Mobile's people customer service great even people helped port old number over
The Phone great


 I found signal sound quality great, however, I found menus little counter-intuitive
 Not bad Motorola, typical Nokia
 The phone fits hand well works well noisy areas
 It uses charger I used 252 back 1998


 

This great round smartphone
 It large bright 64K colour display, easy use joystick neatly designed keymat
 It quick easy snap pictures
 Radio performance voice quality good - handsfree speaker good conference calls
 You quickly send SMS/MMS email messages
 As Series 60 phone add extra applications
 With PC Suite software Sync Calendar &amp; Contacts PC using Bluetooth Infrared 
 It comes 32MB Memory card
Improvements? It would nice memory card hot swappable USB connection
 

I would given phone 5 stars wasn't fact I would rather use 3330 common things phone
 It's important people know following:First, interface slow
 You hit message button front takes matter SECONDS bring menu
 Same contacts list, recent call list everything else
Secondly, addition lag time give command, it's easily useable go
 The number buttons crammed 3x4cm area, fonts small, interface convoluted frustrating, it's customisable well
The plusses features, look, good signal battery life, memory size robustness
 The camera video functionality decent, I can't see wasting time it, people will
All I would say wait cell phone companies create PDA/cell hybrid efficient easy use phone

When I first bought cell phone, battery life great
 I could go many days without charging
 When phone started acting up, I bought new battery
 Now I go one two days without charging
 I don't talk much, battery power used phone on
 I haven't figured cell phone companies making phones last year renew contract get new phone, new battery I got junk
 You make call
 I guess I bought cheapest cell phone battery I could find, maybe get pay for
Who knows
 I trying make end cell phone contract switch service providers without fee
 Maybe I go back old battery
 

battery works fine expected sure check new phone first - strange economy sometimes cheap buy new phone battery included
 

Battery performance bad



I dont think battery original
Every day I charge it

This super item great price delivery speedy
 







































I've phone 2 weeks case full numerous scratches, imagine phone would look like without it
 

I disagree reviewer
 I received mine, fit perfectly phone (all five clips)
 Although fit tight, doesn't come accidentally either
Overall, case becomes practically "invisible" applied, effectively showing beauty N73 design
 I suspect become scratched somewhat easily daily use, considering it's price easily replaced
 The top feature case protection phone screen (sadly big-sized "Nokia" printed right middle original plastic film, covering screen new phone)
Until now, gripes case are:1) It makes harder close lens cover - something I'll eventually get used to;2) It blocks N73 bottom speaker (which used 3D sound effects)
Since Crystal Clear Hard Case rigid transparent, certainly edge silicone cases, opinion hideous anyway
 

case quite poor quality, delivery poor


 everything poor
 even tried persuade put negative review item return 50% shipping fee


 POOR
 

Product wasn't holding well phone made phone even cumbersome 


Sorry, I wouldn't recommend anyone 


 

I purchasing product - wrote 2008 I bought first one:Great product
 I bought minute I purchased Nokia N73 - saved unsightly scratches broken glass
 Protects cell hide beauty chrome
 I thought I wouldn't able use camera ease - I dead wrong
 Highly recommended ALL owners Nokia N73
 

This case already saved phone once
 It easy use, two pieces snap together right around frame Nokia N73 phone
 The case gotten scratched bit it's protecting phone it's supposed do
 $4
99 cheap service providing
 

This case good, like lot protects phone, looks good to
 So say bouth wont dissapointed 

Really dont thik anyone buy this, happy see case arrived broken parts n everything came stated
 Upon trying fit became apparent wud fit, case comes 5 clips fitting(3 one side, 2 other) 1 clip fits perfectly,and others fit okay, 1 doesnt fit cannot clasp, 1 clip throws rest case makin quite uncomfortable work with
 Do favor n this, ur better silicone case, like wat reverting to
 





























































Please don't waste money leather phone case Nokia 3200
 It doesn't fit
 it's big
 






I got sick background noise car Bluetooth, I switched works great noise


 

The title item misleading, label box states supports 1100, 1261, etc
, 1200
When I plug 1200, screen shows "enhancemant supported"
 

I bought case last resort saving respect phone
 I Nokia fan tanks, last phone broken half, shut car door dropped antenna still working abuse
 The 6133 I frail, breaking easily, opening easily camera button often turned pocket
So far case kept phone together, fitting nice snugly
 It fit little awkwardly first I put on, I woke next morning case stretched perfectly
 So far camera button turned phone opened own
 As another member stated, hole around camera lense tricky phone open, little zooming problem vanishes
 There also fact top moved aside plug phone charge, fortunately case elastic straps holding together inside leather moving case simple
 My last phone I take case charge it
In short, I like design, feel appearance case
 When time re-up get another phone, I'll definately buying Krussell case it
 I hope helpful interested
 

This case snug fit Nokia 6133
 The opening case camera lens royal pain
 I hold case opened opening lined-up lens
 At full zoom less problem, lowest focal length, takes effort hold opening place
The true opening "lines up" top phone
 It stretched one side permit connection battery charger
It remains seen case losen use eliminate problems
 Like Krusell case I own, well-made good leather
 

Purchase product Nokia 6126 cell phone
 The fit snug
Difficult put phone first
 The cover sometime interferes power cable I plug phone
 You push aside remove top part cover insure get good connection power cell phone
 But work
 It protect phone clips onto belt
 

Gave try based Amazon picture alone
 Thinner I expected
 Fit "OK"
 Just sturdy OEM unit I used to
 The nice thing least gives slim profile DOES clear plastic protect OUTER screen Nokia 6126
 














































































I bought 2 these, one stopped working 2 months apparent reason
 The light still comes on, charge phone
 Another annoyance needs firmy almost forcefully pushed cigarette lighter adapter
 The slightest movement loosen it, won't know find later phone charged
 Like many cell phone accessories, one get pay go generic non-OEM products
 





















I bought Nokia HS-11W last week replace Jabra HS250 headset past year half; I nust admit headset awesome come
 Lightweight, long battery life, easy pairing Nokia 6620, sound quality excellent
 Did Mention it's comfortable Bluetooth headset I've worn? Bottom line, buy headset regret it
 

Of Nokia bluetooth headsets, best
 light, durable, I sometimes forget even ear
 Sound quality good
 I recomend one highly
 

I Nokia 6620, I charge headset fully, use 20 minutes, conks out


I can't use it
 It's totally worthless me
Even I leave I use 20 minutes, I still get low battery beep, dies
 No standby life, "talk time"


it also gets rather warm touch 20 minutes


 



























The nokia CA-42 USB cable work phone
 My phone disconnected I wanted download contacts move move phone
 I able that
If someone could tell I'd sure appreciate it
 Also software package disc links internet download sofware
 I already download software internet prior purchasing cable
 Unfortunately buy cable truly waste money
 The cost delivery nearly much cable
 It cost return I'll keep it
 

As rating, rating complete dissatisfaction I forced give one star
I bought item Tang Shop
 I get later
 As wire, didn't work
 When I plugged Nokia compatable phone, message screen said "Enhancement recognized"
 Unfortunately I didn't notice right away
 So I spent hour downloading, installing, uninstalling reinstalling drivers, well installing, uninstalling reinstalling Nokia PC Suite software
 Also, wire came software drivers software didn't work either
 Real drag
 Then, since I much trouble, I looked phone screen check wire properly connected phone that's I saw message phone screen: "Enhancement recognized"
 Geez
 My advice, check phone screen first thing plugging enhancement make sure it's communicating phone
As TangShop, I got RMA number (return authorization number) mailed address labels RMA number it
 I returned wire first class mail told didn't receive couldn't issue refund
 They keep asking tracking number I mailed first class
 Never got tracking number returning things
 Ok
 Live learn
 But I find odd that: I didn't get package returned back either it's almost month
 If TangShop didn't get I didn't get back, makes wonder what's going here
 I never business Tang Shop again
 Unfortunately I saw name top page searched internet site
 I business directly Amazon so, Amazon offers protection things, I won't able get that
Oh yeah, I got official OEM Nokia wire another company
 It cost $29 bucks worked without hitch
 Phone recognized right away I transferring files PC immediately
 

Big rip off
 I got cable work one time it, matter I tried, downloaded reinstalled product supported
 I going buy expensive one now, spell "caveat emptor" let buyer beware? 

Excellent product
 The software little outdated, however installed easily quickly updated within program
 With available updates software simple navigate either back important phone information phone numbers stored pictures
 Could also used transfer information one phone another
 Highly recommended anyone types phones 

This cheapest deal cable I needed transfer info dying cell phone computer new phone ASAP
 I originally found $49
99 (without shipping & handling) Nokia site among others, finding $10
51 WITH shipping & handling, I couldn't pass up
Thanks Amazon


 

The performance product intermitent work
 The original Nokia cable also work intermitent computer
 So I can't judge
 

But again, mine came software CD I already downloaded Nokia PC Suite PC
I wonder many dissatisfied buyers didn't right software? 

With price 25% OEM's price, I figured I getting cable
 I found sources drivers none said sure exactly I needed
 When I received purchase mail, included CD correct software
 The cable software excellent
Thanks 

At first I skeptical buying generic product, price I though I'd give try
 I little trouble getting started
 I wasn't sure computer, software, phone problem
 After worked, really well
 I haven't used features yet, photo download
 I like far
 If want download photos phone it's pretty good buy
 

Don't waste time product
 The cable low quality knockoff Nokia OEM cable
 The software would allow 6103 Nokia connect PC
 It kept telling driver properly installed
 I tried reinstalling several time without success
 To top cable end broke phone, I dig dental pick
 Do favor spend 50 bucks Nokia cable save aggravation,,, I wish I 

This item fit Nokia 6102 phone even though advertised so
 Dont waste money
 

I thought good option Nokia brand cable $50
00
 Well wasting hours time getting spotty results (at best) I gave up
 $9
99 drain wasn't nearly bad time I wasted frustration caused
 I searched forums get better info get thing work
 All I found frustrated people little luck getting work
 $50
00 seems like lot money data cable, I I would buy name brand heartbeat
 If technicality savvy maybe you'll find good challenge get work, I think wadding paper throwing waist basket better use time
 Tried two computers using directions T nothing
 On top tech support site company selling cable work pretty shady ask me
 I write reviews things I really like really hate falls latter category
 Do favor save time money
 

When bought USB Data Cable little worried wouldn't work read reviews none positive
 I told "This wont happen me, maybe cable work
" well wrong
 want buy product thinking like was, going waste time money product sucks
 It advertised compatible Nokia 6102i phone, didn't work 6102i
 took forever install drivers download bunch diffrent programs still doesnt work
 When plugged cable phne says "Enhancement supported"
 I gave im thinking buying expensive cable too
 dont buy cheap imitation wasting time money
 

This cable simply doesn't work
 It says "Enhancement Not Supported" every time connect PC
 I've done tons research figure remedy nothing works
 It cost 5
50 eBay it's huge loss, don't let low price entice you-- it's rip off
 

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY

 This product pile junk completely worthless
 

I able get cable software work
 Kept getting error
 I guess Nokia phones dont work generic CA 42 cables
 I using email facility phone transfer pix phone pc
 

Unfortunately, product work advertised
 First all, genuine Nokia CA-42 cable
 It aftermarket cable
 Because this, work properly Nokia 6102i phone
 I would recommend product Nokia phones
 It unfortunate, genuine Nokia CA-42 cable much expensive knockoff
 Nokia ashamed selling simple cable $50
 Aftermarket retails also ashamed selling something I think know work properly Nokia phones
 

This didn't work phone
 Cheaper appealing better case
 Buy original want link computer phone
 

My wife's Nokia phone, whatever reason could set transfer photo's PC
We ordered cable hopes would allow us retrieve photo'ds- luck
We returned cable vendor, issued credit
 We REALLY would wantyed pictures- 











































































































































































Cable come software drivers impossible find
 Sellers website offers help
 Can't get work
 This problem knockoff cables time I find out
 Search web find many discussions many people found same
 Spend little money research product purchase see works
 Wish I did
 

After going getting drivers (which provided), device still would work
 When I attempted remove device USB port, cable smoothly detached USB connector, leaving connector USB port
 

The worst service I life
 I bought DNK-5 cable, useless came driver
 The seller (Accessory Export, LLC) say offer driver advertising, obviously "the small letter contract"
 No interface cable anything without driver
Beware product
 Horrible
 




































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































This 4th Nokia phone, replacing 6600
 The design quite nice, easy start camera (just open flap rotate, camera ready click), It good well screen facing phone, navigate menu, names
 But I didn't like can't answer phone, one click screen facing up

It easy handle phone, yet loaded many good features
 

This Symbian based Smartphone great
 I read reviews difficult use navigation buttons since location bottom screen time buttons become easy use
 All one GREAT phone
 



Even though Nokida model, 6126, listed working arrived I thought oh-man shipped wrong thing
 Then I looked model number cable one I ordered
 Then I thought oh man I ordered wrong thing
Turns works even though connections seem match, secure, actually high transfer rate
 So get doesn't seem like would fit, play snaps probably work model listed
 

This arrived appeared Nokia retail package, Nokia insignia cable
 It appeared genuine
 The package lists Nokia phones number, says "and compatible phones"
 Orientation unique Nokia plug (?POP) obvious plug go easily(until it's perfectly lined up)
 For 6126 plug needs oriented Nokia insignia front phone
 Once connected cable worked perfectly
 

For people interested purchasing excellent quality product works like factory model also tenth price sold stores, you
 You need transfer music files backup files, USB Cable thing get
 I received item 3 days, product golden, I able transfer ringtones phone more


 I highly recommend product people put little effort finding good deals online it
 

This cable allows phone PC image picture transfer
 You need download Nokia software free, gets job done
 Some small hicups data coming media player, song info transfers Nokia program, usable
 

I ordering Blue Tooth headset I saw seller



and I got $4
00



 Like another person said, looks OEM, heck, it's cable
 I Nokia 6125 (a little tricky connect, line take time
) I downloaded software directly Nokia (FREE) followed directions, simple
 What I like sent Text Messages phone connected computer software I office day home
 The connectors fit nicely don't need forced phone causing damage



like non-OEM products
 I also bought car charger folks $4
00 too



and came looking OEM packaging cable
 If stuff knock-off, they're good versions them
 If Nokia phone, get one simplify life comes adding Contacts, moving photos around, backing stuff phone



and don't rely Cell Provider it


 

The Nokia cable worked great price less I expected
 I appreciate prompt processing order fact I received product days
 I unable find cable previously sites
 The information web site concerning cable clear
 

The cable works fine
The Phone is, however somewhat cryptic layout procedure
I thought cable would allow "fix" phones strange way saving files
No luck
 I still things Nokia way
 

This PERFECT USB cable Nokia 6085
 DON'T fooled




 ALL need cable FREE software download Nokia use phone PC together
 I also got memory card headphones so, needs iPod now? Works Pics, MP3's, Contacts, phone modem, MUCH, MUCH more

At low price, I received cable quickly
 While immediately obvious plug cell phone, one eventually finds back needs removed phone little flap connector phone fallen off
 It's great cable "Best Cable Year" award, would certainly win it
 

I sure cable works fantastically
As long used correct phone
 I know better, price incredibly low- especailly originally purchased correct cable Nokia 2 years ago fifty bucks- I felt, even phone listed, hey, could still work, right?Wrong
 But effort write 'helpful' review I add, fact OEM Nokia CA-52 cable, inexpensive, arrived much sooner expected
 

This cable requires Windows XP requires 2nd 3rd Service Pack I can't get
 So cord useless I upgrade computer going take couple hundred dollars
 I disappointed I cell phone full pictures I don't want lose I can't get phone either
 I'm disappointed
 

Received cable timely basis
 Needed transfer information onto computer I would lost information
Unfortunately I cable phone company messed phone contacts deleted info instead transferring them
But cable job received nick time
 Definitely genuine cable Nokia
 

No problems cable
 Its official Nokia cable came official Nokia bag
 Works well, transfers from/to phone/pc ease
 

This cable allows easy transfer photos videos Nokia phone computer without remove memory card phone
 

got long ago, I'm even sure I one go it

 

I searched local stores item could find anywhere
 I searched online first price I came across almost 25
00, I found amazon

00










makes one wonder exact product another company could possibly offer
 

The pins little uneven, works
 Great price
 Received days
 

Genuine, high quality sturdy Nokia product
 A little tricky plug phone (hold tongue right) connects fine
The Nokia PC Suite software I downloaded (not at&t;) little buggy, though
This cable cost less $3
00 + shipping A1
 The at&t; store wanted $39
95 didn't stock
 

How exciting connexion cable ? Well, one it's supposed : connect phone computer (USB port)
 That's

Up till last year, I still fully one old-school Sony CD-Walkmans music
 My cell-phone old could used make phone calls

Then, I finally upgraded cell-phone

 So I went back ordered Nokia OEM CA-53 USB data cable, great choice
I've cable year overall, works great
 The cable material feels much better generic brand I bought
 For part, music I rip CD's transfered flawlessly Nokia phone
The minor complaint I sometimes physical connection USB cable Nokia phone little easily knocked-off
 So I take care touch phone data transfered
Overall solid choice I definately recommend Nokia phone

As Washington State went hands free law (good idea) I needed old, great performing, little Nokia
 Easy use bucks gets job done
 Definately good choice need description
 

The drawback doesn't over-the-ear hook feels like earbud fall ear
 It hasn't -- yet -- I use driving, less active walking around
 (Got WA passed handheld-while-driving law, I drive stick shift, requires hands driving) 

The earbuds work good sound little uncomfortable wear longer periods time
 Unfortunately earbud available phone
 

I searced everywhere head set fit Nokia cell phone
 Although headsets fit phone work (could hear them)
 This headset however works perfectly
 The price certainly right I bought two I always spare
 Speedy delivery, too
 I happy
 

pluged handfree cell phone didnt work, upon taking tip broke phone phone doesnt work

Thank product came quickly also great price
 

This great hands free device basic phone
 The mic works great, haven't complaints end

 Couldn't ask better
 

SIMPLE HANDS FREE WIRE TO KEEP IN YOUR CAR; NOTHING FANCY BUT IT SERVES ITS PURPOSE 

Hi,I bought 2-3 months back
 It works fine I recommend low price usefulness
Thanks
 

THE NOKIA EAR BUD WAS PRICED VERY REASONABLY
 IT ARRIVED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
 IT WORKS PERFECTLY
 I CAN HEAR MY CALLER VERY WELL
 THANK YOU, AMAZON, FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BUY THIS PRODUCT
 

I didn't realize I got one phone fine
 

This excellent product
 sensative person end always hear 

I needed headset law change Los Angeles, I spent $5 bought headset
Works great - I keep car plug whenever I need to
It's cheap, easy, simple, works fine
What else say - - - 

I bought 3 every one showed car instead headphone
 This renders unusable, speaker doesn't work
 Didn't bother returning since cheap, late
 Don't like purchase multiple items time, STILL get charged separate shipping each- way Amazon purchases
 

Great price makes almost disposable headsets 4
 Just buy one six months use
 I break them
 

I like product I able hear person -- I havea 12-year old Nokia cellphone holding ear useless


 tohave earbud


 It get 5 stars (while works fine), wire isso fragile every 2-3 years breaks I reorder
 addition notstay ear is, adapter piece I get Radio Shack
But sound quality transmit first class
 

I like earbud 2005-but-still-useful phone
 For price, trick
 The wires pretty thin I always think they're going snap I snag something, far good
 I similar one AT&T store didn't last long one's workhorse
 

This correct ear plug Nokia 6010


Having difficult time finding right one


Will continue look 

We looking replacement earpiece old cell phone, luck local stores
 We found looking here
 The earpiece great
 The delivery prompt
 Thank you
 

In looking replacement headset Nokia, I first tried "Wireless Solutions Ear Bud Headset LG Phones"(which supposed work Nokia), experiments feedback people I called showed voice came muffled
These OEM headsets Nokia perfect, half price
 After trying first one, I bought 2 backups
 

Don't want ding product - I one took chance cheap price, found ti failed work 6650 (I hear, mike isn't connected
 I guess I need different sequence ring/metal components plug)
I'm Bluetooth now, marginal cost buying wired adapter try existing shipping-paid order low, huge loss
Looks well built
 May work Nokia phones, 6650
 

Best Head Set Yet
 Hands free driving,comfortable ear, good clarity sound,easy store pocket use,can lots task talking set
Highly recommend
 




















































































This best headset I've found trying returning quite different brands/models
 After recent loss, I ordered model Amazon return item twice instance would charge
When it's plugged charge, light supposed come & stay it's fully charged, I insert plug charge it-the light briefly goes charge
It must manufacturers defect, I'm willing try again, I don't think Amazon 3rd exchange
 

I tried headsets find one works, clear sound, loud enough volume comfortable
 Well, trying one, I still looking
This headset comfortable form ear loop fit ear
 It light weight fairly small
 However, matter I adjusted turned volume way, I still could hear caller
 I returned day I received it
 

This good product keep hand busy, attending phone


But, product problems trying connect it
 






























































































































































































































I think used don't really hold charge better old ones

I ordered two batteries wife's Nokia cell phones
 They arrived reasonable time I charged sure ready phones
 However, charge didn't last long old batteries I replacing
 I charged second time lasted half time old ones
 I put desk I using old batteries again
I contact seller I didn't want hassle sending back, paying shipping, perhaps receiving another set weren't good
 I get another set wife I I near Nokia store city
 

My cell phone (Nokia)had transmit life 5 minutes would shut down
 This happened even full charging cycle
 I took AT&T
 They offered new 2 year contract free phone
 I asked new battery would cost said $42
 Well, way
 I went line found exact battery $10 including delivery
 The battery came couple days
 It even Nokia holograph
 I charged it, replaced battery cell phone Voil&agrave;, instant fix
 (I also bought $34 Motorola cell phone quite pleased)
 So I two working cell phones I one happy camper
 

I purchased battery upon first use, didn't remain charged hour, really unusual new battery
 My phone would cut constantly, really inconvenient
 I wrote company I purchased battery received new battery free charge two weeks
 I haven't tried use new battery, I'm hoping works better first
 

I pleased speed delivery
 The battery installed 2 year old cell phone working like new again
 

got order today,i'm dissapointed new

they make money ready recycling battery
i hope enough juice price,i'll let review warning
 

It's battery, made GPS receiver work
 What say? 

All All battery works fine
 One small problem, battery little thicker be
 This leads suspect one selling slightly defective batteries
 I proof except battery
 This causes back phone (cover) quite fit
 The battery charge & seems work fine that
 I hope problem mine
 

850MAH LI-ION BATTERYI got '850MAH LI-ION BATTERY' BL-5C Nokia battery from:Shipper seller 'SF Planet'AKA'CCMAccessories'AKA'Malcom Distributors'I received battery charging
 I unaware perform return I am
This note point product seems official Nokia product official Nokia hologram sticker
 The worrying issue 'serial type' number hologram marked over
 I don't know means doesnt seem right
________________________________________Oct 8 2008Okay I'm upgrading rating four star
 I charged new of-the-box battery Sunday, ran Monday, Tuesday today Wednesday died 4pm
 To that's good, way new Nokia battery act
It looses one star dodgy logo number cover-up I rubbed off
My Nokia 6230 happy I
 

This real Nokia battery 1/10th cost buying Nokia
The seller shipped fast I got Batteries quickly
 Well worth it
 

Battery wouldnt work phone, said sim inactive
 came packaging etc
 shipped fast though 

Bought Nokia 6230
 This battery works great original
 As one reviewer said before, one check authencity battery entering serial number Nokia's site
 My phone, dying old battery, got fresh lease life
 The battery usually lasts 2 - 3 days (around 5 6 hours talk time)
 This battery higher mAh (more battery power) Nokia BL-5C sold countries
 Pleased battery life
 I think negative reviews may people bought cheap counterfeit batteries sellers Amazon Marketplace
 

This battery appears authentic
 It still works great weeks, came hologram code authenticate Nokia website
 Great buy
 

I 2 weeks, far goodI order amazon It took two weeks deliver itbut original, I checked serial number NokiaI satisfied 

don't know battery getting poor reviews one purchased amazon (and third party sellers)is real nokia genuine product comes original package
 month since bought battery last almost 2 days bluetooth headset enabled compare old battery barely last almost 8 hours
 also price amazon might higher compare one's 3rd party sellers still find affordable compare price nokia's website (~ $49
95)
 

Received 2 batteries - DOAAmazon promised replace
 HAS NOT HAPPENED
 

I bought replacement battery Nokia N-Gage QD 3 months ago
 I've n-gage 2 years now, thought time get replacement battery
 The vendor sent battery timely fashion, I complaint them
 However, battery standby time less 2 days
 When I recharged old battery came N-Gage (BL-6C), much longer standby time
 The BL-6C rated 1070 mAH
 I guess difference 250 mAH BL-5C 6C really makes huge difference
 I still use batteries, alternate week 2, battery chance discharge
 In retrospect, I think older battery performing much better chance discharge time time
 Check model battery came original phone, go model
 If 5C 6C, I highly recommend 6C
 Don't get BL-5C
 Good luck
 

The reason BargainCell selling battery cheap counterfeit
 It work cell phone all


 I recommend getting battery Nokia cell phone provider (Cingular, etc)
 

This battery lasts far less battery supposed replace
 It either used genuine
 

I purchased battery Nokia 6230, holds charge original battery included phone
 The battery purchased directly Amazon, marketplace seller
 While Amazon's price higher marketplace sellers, still 15 less R
Shack
 Amazon's battery genuine, I able confim authenticity Nokia web site, I entered 20 digit scratch number located front battery
 

The battery I received I thought I purchasing last anywhere near long original battery
 It seems OEM cellphone batteries offered resellers used, counterfeit both
 In experience, better spending little buying directly Amazon (Lenmar Cellular Phone Battery Nokia 1100, 2610, 6030, 6085, 6555 Series) phone manufacturer
 For older phones, RdoShck batteriesdotcom tend offer higher quality batteries long warranties truly new don't hassle returns
 

The battery received brand new Nokia battery Nokia factory seal
 It performing perfectly
 

This product advertised new NOT come original wrapping like I suspected could hold charge longer hours
 As saying goes "If good true probably is
" Buyer ware 

The battery available "SFplanet" NOT genuine Nokia battery, it's generic one
 But $6 may expected
 The much expensive battery direct Amazon genuine Nokia product
 Too bad use one photo several quite different items
 

Adequately packed shipped fit well
 It's worked like charm far, lasting year already


 almost well original

 

The product worked great
 Put telephone started right I wanted do
 Postage charges provider extremely costly sent US overseas postage charges 

It charges, holds charge yes, still works like new battery should
 Nothing say
 























































































































































































It little old school first glance
 Then open like WOW
 The keys tiny whch works well nails
 It little heavier I use to, well worth it
 Reception great, Over all, I pleased
 
























































































































































I purchased battery low cost
 The one directly Nokia $30 more
 This battery low cost far greater Buy

This headset lightweight fits well ear
 It plenty battery talk-time sound quality good, even environments lots background noise
 

This would 5th Nokia BH-800 bluetooth, probably change another bluetooth
 If one breaks keep buying BH-800
 Love style, love way fits ear, started shutting without letting know turn that's OK
 

Nokia Bluetooth perfect condition,It long battery life, Its color great
 I like shop Amazon
 

I love handy carrying pendant allows wear headset around neck times
 It drives husband crazy, thinks it's odd flashing headset around neck, people think it's jewelry really like it
 The greatest thing don't search bluetooth call comes - fumbling pocket purse - always right around neck
 

cuz it's china spec it's low quilaty give 2 star size it's best sizeif it's nokia's oem internationl spec high quilaty 




















































I problem headset, worked fine weeks, mic seemed keep working, earpiece didn't work more
 I asked Cingular store, lady said common problem Jabra headsets general, one particular
 

I bought Jabra headset replace old Nokia one, ceased work
 I enjoyed Jabra's over-the-ear design, functional comfortable typical earbud
 Also, part, sound quality quite good
 Then, reason, one day suddenly stopped working
 (Oddly enough, person end could still hear me, I could longer hear him
 My Jabra gone deaf
) I'd always stored headset carefully, making great effort never coil wire tightly, let stepped otherwise harmed
 I idea decided malfunction -- did
 So beware: This great headset, mysteriously abruptly broke
Beware 
















































Only one downside: closed, looks like cell-phone belongs 90s
 But open it, get close PC functionality palmtop/smartphone-sized device would take you
And bulk weight price pay one essential killer feature: usable, reliable fast QWERTY keyboard business
 Before buying it, I read rave reviews fantastic keyboard is, I sceptical: I seen many lousy little QWERTY keyboards even come close viable typing instrument
 I bought and, I knew it, I typing - sometimes two three pages - without noticeable discomfort
The e-mail client brilliant, great balance complex functionality bandwidth economy
 The web browser, although Opera-based (it limitations), usable, considering tiny screen web work
 The screen size (very good e-mails Word documents) true reason functions Excel-compatible spreadsheet PowerPoint really fancy "can-do" features rather realistic work tools
Even synchronization (for long time, sad shortcoming Nokia smartphones) sorted, supplied suite works well
A good alternative Blackberry-type email-only devices solid reliable Finnish build
 

get rid stupid connotation cell phone small hold tweezers
 You're gonna love able browse web it, watch movies took kid, write sms take care business fun boring 4-hour meetings, calendar reminds important dates dates life, you're gonna love fact spot coppers opent it, put lap continue convo inconspicuously speakerphone darned police hair
 I'm chick I see huge huys handling miniature phones I CHOKE WITH LAUGHTER
 This phone fit pants pocket, when/if I dont pocket stick in, I've known carry boot, bra, stuck pants back
 And fits chick's boot/bra, big offers
 I've owned communicators 5 years I NEVER EVER without one
 Nuff said
 

I bought phone last year business phone, integrating capabilities work business life
Wireless conectivity big plus connecting wireless networks great use home outside, music available mp3 player, office products available also camera cool keyboard typing
Try ti get third party programs use power safe PDF stuff, one big thing experience, phone doesnt recognize home wireless network blue tooth switched on, turn doscoveres network wireless doesnt work blutooth time

i coudnt find till connection car audio phone, cant listen music car audio, coudnt find separate phone stand also it
the package includes desk stand charger head phones only
As said business phone, another phone motorola Razr v3i daily use Nokia 9500 big use meetings business life
THanks,;) 

This phone designed keep contact ever are
 Cell, WiFi, bluetooth, etc
 All work advertised
By standards, large heavy but, best phone I ever used
With T-mobile area, 9500 best signal phone I've ever had
 I also like I place phone flat surface use similar laptop computer
 Placing calls car, searching contacts, phone numbers, speakerphone, etc
 convenient using method
Outstanding product Nokia
 

Just got phone today, short test I returning phone today
What disappointment
 I currently Nokia 6820 owner I I expecting slick phone lot ease use, instead I got brick phone minimal features
Cons:- This phone huge
 It looks like took cordless phone carrying around cell phone
 To give image could hold croissant ear would smaller phone, look less silly
:)- Speakerphone works clamshell open
 When I driving road, I like put phone speaker mode
 In order open clamshell real drag, since waste battery power display screen run speaker
- No thumb joystick
 On 6820, one best things phone ability quickly navigate thumb joystick
 That eliminated phone
- Keyboard ok, I type faster 6820
 Given large size 9500 need balance phone type
 If hunt peck typer may ok you, used typing quick reply less 10 seconds phone you
- Can't check email main display
 Once order look email open clamshell
 You able look emails outside phone
- No easy PDF viewer
Pros-+ 128MB Memory Card+ Word, Excel, Powerpoint viewer, doesn't pdf capability I could find
+ Sound quality phone speaker phone Nokia standards
I high hopes phone, deserve Nokia name
Soren 

I'm civil engineer looking PDA could help mainly agenda keeping notes meetings
I used three windows-os based PDA's I found operating system fully reliable software sometimes complicated use
It happened I-mate JASJAR ( generally quite good machine ) loose one important meeting alarm didn't ring twice software crashed I writing extremely important notes
I moved nokia communicator 9500 I loved software perfectly suits requirements ( agenda, short notes, calculations, good alarm, small use e-mail web )
If compared I-MATE JASJAR Nokia well built little bulky ( little bit long thick pocket ), screen 8 lines working word ( compared 12 I-mate ) processor slower ( particularly open large files )
However software reliable easy use I could never go back windows OS more
 

I bought phone new years ago
 It original smartphone, cost $700
 Users US need aware works GSM frequencies 900/1800/1900 MHz
 It work 850 MHz
 In US, 900 1800 used cell phones
 T-mobile uses 1900 roams 850
 ATT works primarily 850 1900
 In past, I used phone T-Mobile SIM across US, worked almost everywhere I went
 In areas 850 signal 1900 signal would work
 This phone also picks WIFI
 The 9500 compared Nokia 9300, Wifi, 9300 phones sold Cingular manufactured use 850 instead 900MHz
 

This professional business phone
 Apart routine stuff mobile phones , 9500 fax/ data feature best thing I like phone
 You send & receive faxes
 Now makes real mobile
Although bulky I think one gets used pretty soon
Excel, Word, Power point documents viewed & edited
The screen size wide (112mm wide) browsing email cool
Everything think nokia 9500
 Without stupid softwares like calorie counting, shopping list, etc etc I don't think people use
However blackberry & treo 650 coming phone loosing charm BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NOKIA IS COMNG UP WITH A NEW Software "Business Centre
 Which compatible 9500 & 9300 
 This software push email like treo & blackberry
 

I bought phone gift relative
 It great need basic stuff like calling, text messages
 It's simple swipe SIM's card ready go
 It good people don't care much Caller-Id panel front phone, taking pictures isn't camera phone
 

This phone really lousy cellphone
 First all, reception terrible
 You can't hear anything it's fuzzy
 When I compared reception Motorola Razr V3, Razr beat outright
Then, 8 months it, battery proceeded leak acid bag phone
 I lucky I didn't burn myself
Then Nokia refused help told "out warranty", ridiculous I bought January 2007
If want nice, boring, simple phone, bells whistles like camera whatever, I recommend Samsung T-209
 My friend likes it
 

I wanted phone mainly voice, text messaging
 I bought unlocked phone I didn't deal rigmarole phone store
 I slipped SIM card in
 I don't use browser I wasn't interested camera, phone doesn't have
 The phone works well
 It seems take several clicks navigate around perhaps could bit efficient (the reason 4 5)
 The sound quality reception good be, battery life fantastic compare older phone, comfortable use
 

Phone brand new, battery - even right one
 It bigger tell used old
 Dont know Nokia phone is, 6061
 I cant believe would send something like that; time till sent everything brand new
 I buy new battery, I wanted say I disappointed service time
 It come real quick, 7 days so, but


so sad
O, yea, soon I get new battery I tell phone good not, cos I cant tell right now


 

Come next January, California law require headsets using cell phones cars
 THERE ARE ONLY THREE HEADSETS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PHONE, AND THEY ARE UNIFORMLY TERRIBLE
 Despite plantronics website tell you, none headsets work phone (except one sub-standard earbud-type)--I know: I plugged every single one phone, didn't work
 None Jabra headsets work phone
 There two "earbud" headsets work, one horrible over-the-ear headset (you get one Amazon $10, wish throw away $10)
 They unusable road noise vehicle
 If plan drive phone want use headset, get something Nokia 6061

 The phone easily accesible still inside case
 
















My cell phone phone I use constantly
 For perspective, past secondary headsets Jabra BT250's Nextlink AX2 -- go ear (not ear)
 I got Nokia BH-900 Best Buy $110 - definitely high side headset whole user interface phone call placed - quality important me
 Overall, good noise cancellation, good sound quality incoming outgoing, typically good Nokia fit finish
Pros:* solid construction - plastic touches black chrome - feels solid heavy* sliding boom moves microphone closer mouth well answers/ends call* unique (to Nokia) ear hook secure comfortable figure attach (for me, pointing boom 6 o'clock lowering headset ear, rear/lower hook going behind earlobe, rotating counter-clockwise 4 o'clock got secure fit made headset unnoticeable on)* volume control able amplify caller's voice significantly loud enough - rocker switch enabled easy fine tuningCons:* Ear hook design took day two perfect I put -- easier leave take off* Definitely smallest headset* Sliding boom potential point failureOverall, great headset premium price - time tell delivers full value
 






I left old charger hotel room ordered one

It's excellent case
 Fits Nokia 6125 perfect
 I recomend everyone
 



I got 2005 used 09 moved fancier
 well February I got put sim back ordered 8 dollar battery
 nice go week charges reception better phones I tried use
 Going stick awhile 

I Nokia 6010 model cellphone several years now, getting new T-mobile years ago
 The phone worked every time, gets great reception compared models I used (a dropped calls, network phone) replacement batteries cheap buy needed
 If need basic phone model work network, buy phone
 I changed fancy expensive Motorola phone put Spiderman faceplates Nokia 6010 model serve grandson's first phone
 No complaints many years usage
 

I received phone quickly
 I bought mother problem battery
 I problems getting new one
 Excellent service seller
 

The keypad died month ago
 I shopping replacement phone time I couldn't find anything I liked
 Especially since I'd lose majority contacts I switched phones
 So I decided buy this
 It perfect choice: great price, fast delivery easy installation
 Was talking family 5 minutes receiving order
 

This amazing cell phone, real die hard take knocked without falling apart
 I mine 8 years it's still working fine
 If locked, easy find unlock codes online follow instructions turn SIM card restriction off
 

I got phone 2006 used January 2013, due pressures upgrade Smartphone
 Doing makes appreciate oldie, sturdy HOLDS A CHARGE standby mode least week
 (The Smartphone fun, needs charging almost everyday
) I'm tempted go back old reliable simple friend, even though lacks decent keyboard internet access
 

The SIM card goes current ATT phone compatible technology- therefore unusable
 

Husband loved phone old school can't get upgrade key pad numbers small
 hope stock:-) 

An ancient phone forged indestructible magic, back cellphones built last
 Over course six years dropped buildings, kicked, dunked briefly water still remains excellent working order
 

I completely satisfied cell phone charger
 They work
 I expected nothing less
 

This 4th phone I tried ATT service best reception
 I lost signal twice since I started using it, nothing like phones I tried
 It basic phone, reliable holds charge well
 

I washed husbands phone, bells & whistles, never picked well-never really liked it
 Ordered one inexpensive replacement, used similar one years ago
 Picks great, good reception
 Great basic phone, lot extra stuff don't use; heavy enough I hopefully feel pocket next time I laundry
 Have month, complaints need for: talking, occ
 texting
 

This exactly phone I wanted, happy found it
 However, #3 #5 stick BAD


 I send email seller, response
 I happy phone, find hard believe actually new number stick
 Unfortunately number 359 581 difficult best
 

The cover plastic
The signal reception noty good mentioned reviews
I returned item try another cell phone
 

terrible - work, I thinking old product original case long battery completely dead (not responding charging)
 Bought Iphone instead wasting time garbage 

I've 6010 years
 It never breaks down, never locks up, never goes wierd
 I've fallen back several times, blackberry became quirky, international phone
 Originally, I purchased much expensive spiffy phone camera, bells whistles
 I brought back exchange phone failing get clear line
 I live poor reception area
 The sales person said signal would better would less hassels
 He right
 I always depend little fellow
 It doesn't look like much, I secure calls happen I want to
 This great back up, headache phone
 

Simple, well built, excellent battery life; 6010 great phone-and that's is
There's easy way move information/addresses phone-no bluetooth, included cable
 There 3rd party cable's available
The keyboard large great dialing middle night (like I do)
 I think one largest number keypad's phone
I've dropped phone numerous times, hasn't problems
If want mobile phone nothing else, good choice
 

That's even much better reviewer mentioned: IT web browser works pretty well, just-a-phone thing, cute one decent keyboard, good guys always complaining fingers fitting ok



Works instant communicators
 Yahoo, AIM & AOL, it's coolest feature, indeed
 For weeks connected yahoo, time using phone, well
Every dropped park, 10feet high catch alive well, hill


 Lots ringtones, one buddy call, sms, much user-friendly phone
Charge last much Motorolas, maybe 2 times longer
 Bought second spare one, maybe times I cannot find new one available, one year now




On side I Motorola C650, camera warm outside, can't leave 6010 home, love it
 

Very happy phone
 Just needed basic phone phone at&t gave broke
 I took sim card broken phone put one worked great start
 This phone works places wife's not
 

The first phone I got problems soft key
 I took vacation I came back I told 'Hassel Free' problem
 They said normal send back would send another one
They did
 I got replacement within 10 days works fine 
 I nothing praise
Thanks 




 

These phones replace 3 year old phones
 My parents, 90 & 89, trouble seeing using buttons
 Took chip old cell new problem
 I hand got new one cell company phone
 Can see screen daylight light rooms buttons nightmare
 If don't need camera flip postage stamp size phone, get one
 

THE PHONE THAT I RECEIVED LOOK NEW AND WORKS VERY WELL
 FOR THEPRICE THAT I PAID FOR THE PHONE, EXCELLENT DEAL
DEBBIE IN WV 

I thought phone piece junk
 I mean, doesn't even camera
 I propel mom one black
 When Gustav turned power, phone wouldn't work all
 But mom's kept going
 And go store like JcPenny Lafayette, propel sister's sony erisson lose reception almost instanly
 My mom's keeps going
 I'm keeping propel stylish is


but little baby going purse back up
 I'll get cute face plate it
 

I wanted phone call and/or text people Nokia 6010 fulfilled needs wants
 I'm glad it's unlocked I AT&T; user cell phone made T-Mobile, lol
 I laugh time I remember types cell phones (that didn't colored screen) "it" phones back days, lol
If used use cell phone keyboard whatever, it'll take time get used it's really big deal
 Because I went iPhone Nokia 6010, yep


 it's big change me
 :) 

phone great need easy phone wish little smaller fit pants pocket better good phone 


























































































































I bought battery original battery Nokia 6133 started running gas day
 Within month, replacement batter *also* started needing daily recharge
 I would better buying genuine replacement battery T-Mobile (for $30) rather wasting $10 poor clone
 































































































I got phone months ago pleased it's performance
 Overall simple slick phone strong battery life
 My first full charge lasted 10 days
 It good making calls, takes pretty clear pictures phone, videos don't come great
 When get music mp3 features thigns, isn't great that
 The sound quality isn't good, I wouldn't buy phone thats looking for

 Another annoying feature speaker phone works phone open, close it, call iis ended
 Other that, looking phone jsut phone, I would definatly recomend one
 

I went Nokia old Nokia lasted long took quite beating
 I say, I first got I expecting standard ringtones, menus, etc


to elaborate old brick phone, seemed simpler
 I think Verizon wants get "cooler" items via service pay them
 I also wish speaker phone worked closed phone, instead hangs call
 OTHER THAN THAT


I like phone
 simple phone, capability act MP3 player store photos videos memory card
 I would recommend special made case available Verizon Nokia fits perfectly hels protect phone
 As now, I 7 months problems I hope lasts long old Nokia
****February 2010


Although people making fun phone old, still going strong
 

We absolutely love phone
 My wife search new phone, didn't want spend whole bunch money, loved old Nokia's
 This great someone doesn't need lot bells whistles
 This pretty much straight phone, incredibly light thin
 Much I first thought, almost thin RAZR
 So looking reliable phone make phone calls with, like thin light phone, might phone you
 




































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Nice convenience radio MP3 phone, toe FM reception poor
 


Well I decided I liked Nokia brand well enough try flip phone
 However word true Nokia phone Pan-tech
 I haven't received yet research shows also NOT use PC Suite software Nokia phones
 Aaargh
 I want re-enter phone numbers
 Most likely phone Pan-tech
 I likely won't keep update let know seems flimsy not
Okay
 I tried out
 The phone didn't feel flimsy nice battery compartment battery attached door
 The drawback speaker
 It sounded tinny Nokia phone tune
 I liked I wasn't impressed
 The 6236i great
 The sound feel
 I'm happy I switched phones
 

If main reason using cell phone make phone calls crystal clear reception priority you, definitely right phone you
 My wife I made separate trips local Verizon store, tested phone LG VX8300 8600 Motorola RAZRs KRZRs
 Yes, phones look cooler better cameras features general; however, Nokia 6215i phone much, much clearer less static phones
 The calls sounded better ends: Nokia cell phone caller person received call
 We called landline numbers cell phones, tested phone one multiple times visits Verizon store
We spent inordinate amount time process want get stuck bad service phones ever again
 We miserable customers Cingular 3+ years now, fact expending $600 break family plan contract 6 months early
 It completely pointless cell phone reception calls poor time can't even carry conversation
 I could make calls Cingular phone office downtown Arlington, VA despite fact everyone offices around problems making calls carriers
 I could make phone calls Convention Center Boston despite fact everyone around merrily chatting cell phones, etc
, etc
, etc
I sharing experience hopes saving others lot time, aggravation expense
 If ordered Nokias one day earlier Verizon, would gotten phones free paid activation fee
 Unfortunately, changed online offers overnight additional $220 result
 

I've phone 3 days now
 I got replace old Samsung A530
 Here thoughts:PROS:-very light, compact, small-black glossy exterior looks professional classy
 yes, show fingerprints scratches, it's bad-dual OLED screens vibrant sharp
 inner screen smaller phones, haven't found much problem-reception great
 haven't dropped call yet
 reason rarely get 2 bars reception indoors, doesn't seem affect call quality-ringer loud nice selection built-in ringtones-earpiece speakerphone clear adequate volume-battery life amazing
 i've light-moderate use past 3 days battery indicator still full


CONS:-both screens hard see bright sunlight, even highest brightness setting-no bluetooth, SD memory, MP3 player, etc
 aren't important me
 need slim phone doesn't lot extra bulk
-camera could better, it's phone people, canon powershot
Overall, I'm happy phone I'll glad 2 years
 If need nice compact phone performs well, you
 I haven't problem transferring phone book
 You take "flagship" store right computer it
 I took Verizon branch first, different machine transferred numbers names
Give phone try
 It's Motorola KRZR, it's much cheaper
 You'll happy it
 

I upgraded phone primarily opinion c-net review said phone good voice quality indistinguishable land-line (San Francisco), reviewer (VA) said phone "best voice quality" -- since trouble hearing previous phone, especially mobile-to-mobile calls
 Perhaps area I (north Jersey), I sure tell I'm cell phone
 While better previous model, I'm still saying "what? could repeat that?" In calling Verizon Wireless ask another question, technical supervisor told "the voice quality even reception ability varies lot individual phone phone within every model: get 5 phones model line one sounds different right next they'll display different signal strengths


" Wish I'd known THAT I bought
I like phone's features, since Verizon promotion, it's great deal right now
 It "conveniences" I'll really use
 It doesn't bluetooth hands-free, that's OK me
My biggest complaint LED display (it's LCD new LED display) completely unreadable daylight
 Also must use kind cover: battery comes unclipped slightest touches clasp pulling phone pocket purse
 I find "rounded" shape phones little easier hold "squared" shape, it's easy press exterior screen buttons side holding phone closer ear trying hear better noisy outdoor environment
 

Have phone 36 hours (9/25/06)and told Verizon I delete 150+ stored numbers start scratch (I LG 7000 series I never liked)
 Seems software issue data resolved
 Phone makes call phone book complete call intended answers phone
 Speakerphone calling seems negate defect press speaker button person answers, seems work
 Pressing twice get phone work headset
 Blue tooth headset (Moto H500)paired easily did'nt work speaker option I may discovered
 Looks like nice phone, light, easy use decision is, worth extra steps, reliable enough function normally left guess software fix available "stop-in Verizon"? Surely aren't going tell it's ready
 Probably worth wait buy phone choose another tons numbers enter
 Verizon known this, I'm sure it's great first time phone don't lots numbers transfer over
 

This first cell phone I got Verizon Wireless plan I quite impressed
 I really like sleek glossy look goes around phone
 Suprisingly enough 7 months use doesn't major scratches surface
I NEVER lost call service wherever I gone using phone
 It amazing since I always used terrible time trying find spot older phones would get one bar service
I complaint though, screen inside phone tiny
 If eyes bad I would recommend phone larger screen
 Other I praise phone, especially since I didn't pay anything plan
 

I bought phone verizon replacement 6256i rocked high heaven
 I bought partially glowing reviews area especially signal reception reports
I find phone poor reception compared 6256i
 It takes couple bars signal even boot 6256 booting even bar
 The camera crap I knew advance
 The buttons way close together cause lots screwed sequences button pushing
 The clarity reception I don't see
 My mother little hard hearing can't understand phone problem 6256
 The front display tiny clock large readable
 The inside display small made smaller banners top bottom another banner added whenever voice data mail received
 The colors vivid however
 The available memory VERY small


I can't believe made phone without on-board memory
I'm getting another replacement sent since perform advanced functions due it's inability get programming update via *228 function
 If reception next phone clarity understandable mother, I'm swaping another phone
 

The Nokia 6215i may entry level phone -- one given away contracts -- job adequately
 The reception excellent, important feature
 The phone extendable antenna, might seem out-of-style, reception remained quite good without extension
The camera average, far I concerned, phone camera taking quick pictures show friends are, something funny, etc
 If I want something I print frame, I'll still use regular camera
 There flash, come handy
The unique part phone, however, screen
 Though small, screens made new OLED technology, extremely bright terrific contrast average lighting
 On traditional LCD screen, large backlight sends light every pixel, pixel like little nightshade
 To make dark point, screen pulls nightshade block much backlight possible
 But pixels can't block 100% light; little bit always leaks through, especially look angles
 A good analogy window blind -- never perfect blocking sun, look different angles, get less light through
On OLED screen, pixel like tiny little light bulb, turn independently one another
 When off, completely off, gives screen amazing contrast
 It also looks identically sharp regardless viewing angle
Unfortunately, COMPLETELY invisible bright sunlight, even cellphone screens
 This also fact pixel generates light directly rather blocking it
 Even though light generated OLED impressive, match sun, gets washed completely
 On hand, since LCD works blocking light, still able block sunlight form visible image, even designed illuminated back
 The nightshade/light bulb analogy appropriate
 In sunlit room, turning light bulb makes lot less difference compared pulling blinds
 So, OLED bit double-edged sword
My significant quibble low memory capacity, ability expansion
 4 MB much; won't able keep many pictures ringtones
Overall, phone quite good
 It small light, looks rather sleek
 Most importantly, makes crystal clear calls drops I remember
 That would earned 5 stars, screen problem limited memory knock notch
 

I bought phone couple months ago
 It looked great online person, I HATE keys


 raised it's difficult text message
 Also, "OK" button really small
 It's sleek pretty- I'll give that
 I like speaker, sounds fine, I like I take decent pics


 I hate screen saver
 Does anyone know turn off? I also dislike fact I push extra buttons send text
 My old LG 2 3 steps- Nokia steps doubled, bit pain
 All all, though, I really like phone
 I'm sure I need get used little things
 Buttons all
 

My old Motorola 265 cut-out problem occasionally I decide upgrade new phone
 I signed two-year contract get phone free Verizon website
 Then headache started
The new phone looks nice works nice except speakphone loud Motorola 265
 But since second day I got phone, I found I'm much worse cut-out problem old phone
 I call Verizon replacement
 The first replacement works worse original one
 So, replace again
 The second replacement still cut-out problem I energy care problem --- speakerphone totally doesn't work
 I need speakerphone everyday I chat phone husband
Verizon happy either
 Their CS told ship I don't trust service more
 Therefore I brought phone local store
 But local store exchange account shows cell phone 3 months warranty(??

)
I'm tired I still call Verizon
 Today told going ship another model, Motorola V325i
 I checked customer review Amazon find bad reviews
 I don't know new one work I'm tired argue more
From three Nokia 6215i phones I've got, I tell speakerphone generally soft (but current one totally doesn't work)
 If speakerphone feature important you, keep away model
 

I've cell phone 2 days great
 Text messaging, phone calls, camera work fine
 The image screen high quality
 Overall, works great
 































































































































































Upon receiving item I already upset I led believe Nokia product not
 The item gift, I even upset learn battery large fit 3120 allow cover close
 DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY
 

I ordered battery, thick 6230 cover cannot close
 Maybe sent wrong battery prepared send back


 

The image Lithium Ion Battery shown website original battery come w/ Nokia phone
 That battery made Japan truly longer standby life (4-5 days)
 The one I received mail imitation product made China
 battery 6-8 hours standby time
 I threw garbage couple week
Is Zero star rating
Ben 












































































































































sigh



 I got 2 N75 working need replacement



please dont buy n75 
 






















































































I ordered first N75 month ago
 I liked first two weeks later started problems
 The first problem caller id data external screen
 I later found downloaded themes won't display information external screen
 So I use Nokia AT&T; theme order get caller id
 No big deal
 About week later I set phone desk, inserted charger left hours
 When I returned I noticed big black spot external screen
 I could see even phone turned off
 It looked like quarter sized ink spot
 When I turned phone external screen jumbled lines running across big black spot
 So I returned it
 Now I phone #2
 The first thing I put SIM card battery plugged charger
 Nothing happened
 I noticed slight buzzing sound coming charger got really hot
 I tried another outlet nothing happened
 The screen phone said "Not Charging"
 I plugged charger first phone waiting returned thing happened, "Not Charging" msg appeared
 I switched two phones batteries thing happened
 I think faulty charger shorted phone batteries also fried SIM card
 I go AT&T; store get new SIM card
 So phone got returned I phone #3
 So far good


I really like phone it's working
 It's nice looking phone that's customizable
 My complaints far would top buttons close together hard push without pushing another one
 Also place SIM card goes bad spot
 I need tweezers remove it
 The battery seems little weak
 I need charge daily even I set packet data "when needed"
 Also I use downloaded theme I sacrifice caller id external screen so
 































































































































































































































I THREE last year
 All broken (not physcially, internally) least I got refunds first 2
 The last I bought private seller Amazon wisened decided sell defective item anymore
 The reason I've bought 3 it's comfortable design made phone
 I hate earbud design
 

Product never arrived
 Evidently lost mail
 I requested information seller 3/24/08 3/26/08 regarding whether shipment insured
No response received
 

This one worst product I've ever encountered
 I bought 3rd replacement weeks ago guess what






yup it's broken again
 This one 3 strikes you're deal
 I frustrated I willing go buy new phone I use different headset hopefully one takes 2
5mm jack I get options headsets
 

The headset works well stays connected phone (previous versions tended pop out)
 

This product excellent
 second time got last one used, 4 years
 Buy without thinking twice
 Excellent voice quality dont shout train commuting headset sensitive sound
 

can't beat price, doesn't fall ear like may kinds
 really like it
 think since bud part doesn't really sit well ear, there's lot outside noise (like traffic NYC), it's tough hear person
 Still, price, it's great
 










































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Upgraded Cingular 3120, earlier similar bar phone
 Sound quality seems better 3120
 Very sensitive
 The black finish fingerprint magnet
 This basic phone
 If like small bar phones want make receive calls, it's hard beat
I noticed negative comments elsewhere adjusting earpiece volume received calls, lack documentation
 Many said "right-left navigation key" method works call, volume reverts default hang up
Here's _permanently_ adjust earpiece volume received calls
 This works 6030 purchesed April, 2007 direct Cingular:1
 Call something recorded message long enough give chance fiddle around
 For example, Montana Department Transportation, 1-800-226-7623
2
 Once you've connected message playing, switch loudspeaker (after first backing away
)
3
 Press right arrow navigation key, you'll get volume bar chart display
4
 Use right left navigation keys raise lower volume
5
 WITHOUT GETTING OUT OF THAT SCREEN, push red button end call6
 The earpiece volume thereafter seems stay set volume chosen
 

I got phone simplest phone Cingular offered
 No camera, fancy internet, I've always good history Nokia phones
Screen
 Very bright, default screensaves included
 You also use JPG GIF images downloaded phone MMS messages
Keypad
 A bit small, fingers don't problem finding buttons
 I've phone year markings still clear
 The thing that's rubbed 'Cingular' logo
Sound
 The phone get nice loud, however loudspeaker used, voice quality degrades volume increases
Volume Control
 This hardest part phone figure out
 The right left buttons center phone adjust volume, you're actually call someone
 This I wish Cingular left two buttons side phone, could adjusted speaking
Ringtones
 I've able play MIDI ringtones, I don't think phone play MP3 ringtons
Sturdiness
 I've dropped phone pavement several times, it's still fine
Overall, I'm pleased phone
 This simplicity features
 All I need phone send receive phone calls
 If need something function PDA, camera, thin RAZR, I wouldn't get phone
 

A Little BackgroundI don't consider Luddite (one stands opposition technological `advances') I DO, general rule, prefer technical devices singular (no pun intended) purpose
 That say, conspicuous exception multi-function printer/copier/scanner/fax machine, I prefer devices focus one function well
 This preference developed years I often experienced results function individual elements seems become compromised trade-off benefit creating kind multi-function package
 I like simple
 This increasingly difficult preference act today's world, items available market become increasingly complex default, readily available consumer state
 For example, automatic transmissions used add-on option new car; one usually pay extra retrofit car standard shift
 It's even difficult find lowest low-end cars come electric windows, air conditioners FM radios CD players default installations
 And isn't cars
 Try find good quality large screen black white TV somewhere get black white photos quickly well developed printed
 I could go many examples, review isn't lot examples
 It one specific cell phone, one optional activations available make simple phone, require activation use
 A cell phone functions quite nicely - simple portable cell phone
 It last type available current carrier, Cingular/ATT made available free upgrade, special request
It meets needs quite nicely Nokia 6030
The general trend electronics, including cell phones, make things smaller smaller - good thing point - complex
 When recent contract Cingular due expire, I eligible new `upgraded' phone
 I surprised discover website listed NO phone option built in, least, still low megapixel digital camera
 Most also included video cameras, text messaging, email general internet access, FM radio MPEG music players
 The unit offered standard free upgrade `flip-phone' - design I eschew increased vulnerability toward breakage, given hinge
 I kind hard things require maximum durability
 This simple model included camera, ability capture video clips, storage music number features I neither wanted needed
 In discussions Customer Service, discovered limited remaining supply 6030 - phone longer routinely offer
 They agreed send one new replacement exchange usual contract renewal agreement
 Nokia DOES continue manufacture ARE available (at low cost) sources GSM system phones, CAN activated Cingular/ATT network
The Nokia 6030As see image posted top page, flip phone
 It often referred `candy bar' phone - flat open moving parts
 It built-in camera video capture ability
 While capacity text messaging, internet access even FM radio, features require activation
There features `basic' cell phone definite improvements recent `old' one, Nokia 6010 well home corded cordless units
It's size convenience make VERY easily portable (4
1" X 1
7" X
7"), it's 500 number/name memory (on either/or/both phone SIM card memory), Caller ID feature included, usually additional fee most/all cellular phones portability it's voicemail capacity - feature I using first time cell phone
Its basic features quite easy use, although manual was, apparently, written native English speakers contains errors I needed call Nokia get straight
 For example, according manual, activate key pad lock, one presses MENU within 1
5 seconds, forward arrow (>)
 This didn't work, code actually MENU followed pressing Star (*) key
 The online manual accurate printed one done NokiaUSA
 I don't know hard manual written, printed Mexico written English Spanish
 I cannot comment accuracy Spanish rendition
 It also `speakerphone' feature functionally worthless smart leave `off' amplification adequate car use microphone sensitive enough work well foot away
 Headsets go
 This phone NOT Bluetooth compatible
The MENU organized similarly Nokia phones I owned used including handy Organizer section gives access Calendar, Calculator, Radio (should want use it), Alarm Clock - real boon travelers
 Unlike 6010 operated 3 channels, phone accesses total 299 them, signal loss FAR less frequent reception quite clear steady locations - including 6010 experienced `dead' zones
 The problem always system it's placement cells - sometimes phone itself
Frustratingly, accessories I accumulated 6010 compatible 6030 - similarity numeric designation unit notwithstanding
 The batteries different (and, course, smaller less talk time - Standby time listed 300 hours, Talk time 5 hours); charging stand I used 6010 work it, plug-in charger
 (Interestingly, NO charging stand manufactured particular model Nokia
) On side coin, headset(s) car charger ARE fully compatible
 I suggest shopping new cell phone, something carefully review compatibility accessories may invested quite bit new phone(s) considering - rather surprised new unit delivered
 Also, information given Cingular I ordered SIM card compliant could simply moved one phone -This simply wrong information I needed bring new phone Cingular retail store move stored numbers old SIM card new one
 But problem system company - phone itself
After couple weeks daily use, I quite pleased it
 As electronic devices, it's idiosyncrasies learned user experience - none terribly complicated
So, (relatively) simple phone - one last kind last one available Cingular/ATT time
 I prefer use still camera take photos, digital Camcorder take videos, real sound system listen music
 I made biases quite explicit I believe consumers able buy want need need willing shop for/negotiate `work-arounds' told want available
 If agree find add-ons unnecessary nuisances, may want check cell phone
It works me
 

This phone built cheap shoddy materials
 The center keypad tiny difficult use without hitting buttons
 

This phone worst I used
when ringing push button awnser sometimes push 1 2 times, one would think bad button, But alwaysworks phone book navigating phone
SLOW


 From main screen, push menu button, One second later screenchanges
Buttons suck 

I got Nokia 6030 (a GSM phone) 4 days ago I replace old Nokia 8260 (a TDMA phone) I got A&T; Wireless back 1999
 I would looking another phone weren't fact Cingular gradually replacing TDMA towers GSM towers thus forcing upgrade
 (Now I get fewer anytime minutes, night 2 hours shorter monthly plan costs 33% more, that's another story
)The last 2 weeks I also tried Motorola Razr V3, Motorola V195, Samsung T809
 I realized I don't like using clamshell slide phone, importantly I noticed serious usability flaws Motorola's Samsung's interface
 (Samsung bad Motorola
) Dialing number without looking keys much harder Motorola Samsung Nokia
 Likewise, using Address Book Motorola's phone much cumbersome using Address Book Nokia
 Motorola requires keystrokes goofy GUI
 Motorola seems work whereas Nokia simply pleasure use
I read reviews Nokia 6030 I got phone I pleasantly surprised negative reviews I read earlier simply true
 The phone big-enough keys, alarm clock, volume keys
 The navigation keys actually overloaded, phone ringing use 4-way navigation keys adjust ringer volume
 Likewise, you're phone, use navigation keys adjust voice volume
 I found I like volume keys face phone better side I don't press accidentally picking phone up
 The best new feature I noticed ability reprogram shortcut keys, example replace Cingular Mall Calculator whatever want single keystroke away
The negative 6030 dual-band phone (GSM 850 1900) perfect within US, limiting overseas
 Nevertheless, phone well
 

We always preferred Nokia candybar style phones, model poorly designed
 It feels like made cheap plastic, like toy
 The protruding buttons make much easy hang cheek
 Sound quality good older monochrome display Nokia phone replaced
Unfortunately, candybar style Nokia Cingular carrying upgraded
 This design seems falling style, love ruggedness
 You drop them, worst shell comes snap back on
 If shell get damaged, get new one phone looks like new
 

I got yesterday, I writing review comparing previous motorola V180 T mobile:pro: good looking, slim, lightweight, outstanding reception cingular, good voice qualitycon: headset, car charger, bottons hard locate push, much wallpaper, rington choice, slow response push botton, shortcut function sucks, multi-alarm, convenient switch silent,vib, normal
My old V180 Tmobile everything good poor reception voice quality, I think important thing cell phone
Though put lots cons nokia here, still gave 4 stars rate cuz little simple phone good performance reception voice
(i active hand now, 6 bars vs 1 bar) cingular rocks
 t-mobile sucks
 

I bought phone cheapest model I pinch
 My previous one Cingular wouldn't give replacement I signed new 2-year contract
 FYI: Cingular good
 I barely hear phone, I frequent ear pain pressing hard side head
 Other that, I like getting internet quickly, though loading time graphics leave much desired
 So sum, pay little better phone get away Cingular fast can
 

I Nokia customer long I've phones
 This first time I've disappointed
First - center "enter" key small
 I end accidentally hitting arrow keys every time I try press it
Second - sometimes phone seems respond key presses respond significant latency
 I don't know hardware software-related
 But it's infuriating
 I've missed calls problems due it
Yeah - two problems
 But they're BIG problems
 I disappointed
 I'll getting new phone soon
 

I'm fourteen years old
 I bought phone quite recently
 Are surprised? If not, whatever
 But are, I've gotta tell you, pretty nice phone
 I'm saying every teen like it, I know I did
 Most teens want go ultra sleek phone features
 I budget, however
 It's small great exterior, though I dislike nokia system
 I looking something cheap, quality
 I two choices: nokia 6031, flip phone, nokia 6030
 The nokia 6031 better system brighter colors, I getting pretty sick using flip phones
 So, I bought candy bar style
 It didn't cost thing, price, it's great buy
 Cingular much better t-mobile comes coverage
 

Everyone seems like phone phone doesn't fit everyone's size
 The phone great small size I problems keypads due tiny size awkward position limited capacities plus ringtones
 It would let use silent mode without making sound set vibrate mode
 I find dissappointing design manipulating cost-effective prohibitiveness usefullness messaging web-browsing
 

I've always bought Nokia cell phones, usually offered friendly, intuitive interface
 I hate phone
 Who would thought cell phone wouldn't come volume controls?I ring tone lowest setting still makes jump rings inside purse, I NEVER seen phone without ability adjust audio levels talking

 I feel like I'm losing hearing right ear, although I hold phone inch away ear talking
The middle wheel small even small fingers, I'm always hitting button vs
 wheel
 When I press end call button, reason always activates speakerphone first
 I bought 2 year warranty feel I'm stuck it
 

I phone cingular, it's 6061 model, one great
 

Ive using Nokia 6590i years, dropping repeatedly, subjecting sorts abuse, it's rock solid - recently
 Starting getting classic "insert sim card" problem, whenever I would jar phone lightly
 But hey, worked, kicked butt
 So, Ive moved up(?) 6030
 The reason I bring 6590 I would surprised 6030 lifespan like 6590, similar operating conditions
 The build quality used be
 That said


let's see :Let's clear things previous reviewers:1) volume control - no, doesnt side buttons like 6590 has, play around bit, you'll convinced, like I was, doesnt control
 Ah, does, buried menus
 If dont put menu item option navigation button (manually), it's hard use
 If do, it's better side button setup
 Click menu/settings/my shortcuts/navigation key/(select) choose navig arrow four want put on
 Just scroll menu2) Key response - IS problem, others noticed
 There significant lag time pressing menu key item, getting phone want
 This irritating, I live it, it's drastic
3) key lock - prone put pocket, definitely learn menuselect followed asterix keystroke
 Learn it, know it, live it
 It's lifesaver
4) keys - yes, bit small
 Whoever wrote large never seen phone
 It's marginally bigger 6590i, one Nokia's smallest ever
 The feel keys leaves somethign desired - bit mushy wiggly
 The first unit I got I return keys press distinctly
 If problem, definitely bring back try another
 My second phone big improvement
 You tell problem keys dont press like others (in terms feel)5) End call button - phone goes speakerphone press this, it's probably defective
 This never happened me
6) Wallpaper, screensavers, etc - suck
 But part classic cingular mall scam, put bunch crap phone, hope go buy different ones
 Same ringtones, although ones phone serviceable, good
 There ways around issue, reading, you'll figure out
 google friend (at least case)
7) For person thinks convenient switch silent,vib, normal, I say true
 You stick goto menu
 Just click upper left blue key, key options, organize
 You change menu, order list items
8) NO headset, car charger, voice dialing
 True
 But expect something cheap???9) No nokia faceplate cover options, far I tell
 There sale web, look super cheapo crap make China makes phone look like piece stale candy
 Avoid
Aside things mentioned previous reviews - screen resolution good
 You looking small area, 65k colors, 128*128 pixels, pretty grainy
 The brightness decent, nothing cheer about
The word Cingular (or carrier) often printed bottom phone - really detracts otherwise decent looks
 Here trick
 Get cotton shirt soft material, fingernail, still attached finger
 :) Wrap nail shirt rub back forth
 Presto - bye bye logo
Of course, know means though - keys (if type puts pocket) going numbers letters wear pretty quickly
The calls made menu improvement (at least 3 yr old phone), hit green send key, shows recent call list, date time (not name)
 So made improvements menu system
If I figure major likes/dislikes, I'll come back list more
 Overall, arent looking fancy phone, want phone good battery life, clear signal, decent reception (at least cingular) small form factor good looks, cant go wrong
 If upgrading cingular actually free
 

I find phone nicely compact, keypad bit small side
 Makes whole phone feel little bit "fiddly"
 I went local Cingular store check options found norm phone size
 No complaints reception
 I switched Motorola V180--this phone far superior terms reception
I receive earpiece phone doesn't use 2
5mm standard jack
 It uses headset jack Nokia candy bar style phones (3595, 6010)
 One feature I would liked voice dialing
 This standard 2 year old 3595 much used
Finally, I haven't found accessories phone, yet
 No perfectly sized holsters optional color masks
In summary, phone takes care basics well small enough carried everyday, day
 4 stars competent phone
 Loses star non-standard headset jack lack voice dialing
 

I phone days I already pleased
 I major reception problems old LG L1400, Cingular credited get new phone, one happened fit bill
 I don't need lots extras, I want able store #'s make calls, phone that
 I agree navigation key bit small, "deal-breaker" me
 I love customize shortcut keys


 I would much rather quick access things like calculator received call log internet
 Also, I pictures stored old LG I wanted get onto phone, simplest thing email myself, send new phone
 They look great, I actually impressed clarity screen


 visible pixels
 Also, phone sleek compact, looks good sturdy solid
 And battery life amazing


 I already 4th day I still FULL charge


 I used charge LG every night
 All all, I forgot much I used love Nokia, would definitely recommend phone
 

A couple months ago I upgraded old ATT TDMA service phone GSM service
 I'd held old TDMA better coverage remote areas West Texas I travel, time


Turns I even better coverage great little phone
 I'm "older" user, much ringtones wallpaper
 But phone Cingular pull great reception great coverage
 The speakerphone works well, radio nice feature (mono, crisp reception)
 Nokia promises 2-bud headset soon
 I especially like able pull most-used features custom menu
The Amazon product review uses word "large" least twice
 There's nothing large phone
 Tiny phone, tiny keys, tiny screen, tiny, tiny everything
 It feels solid though, looks sleek cool, white letters black look bit retro
 Battery lasts forever
 Solid Nokia quality
 

I model phone Cingular two months without problems
 Also got one mother technically savvy needed something simple
 You really get don't many bells whistles phones want something decent speaker good reception fit bill
 I dropped phone hight 3 feet 3 times without showing damage (it leather case 2 drops)
 Also "nice" looking phone
Only critisms
 Seems bit small male hand, maybe I bit clumbsy
 Its NOT ready FM radio box
 I called Cingular told Nokia accessory it
 Going Nokia's webpage informed addon component soon
 This brings last point lot ringtones accessories model date, I image change soon
 

I admit I first got phone I like all
 In fact I every intention getting rid ASAP
 I since decided keep really nice phone
 I Motorola reception horrible
 This phone outstanding reception response previous review yes way adjust volume
 I opposite problem


my volume low I could figure adjust it
 There NO mention handbook odd, google find instructions it
 Once I got volume controls taken care smooth sailing
 I would like choices wallpaper ringtones need tough little phone gets job done it
 

Each time I get new phone, I always seem go style Nokia
 They changed slightly years, still good, reliable, easy-to-use phone
I Rheumatoid Arthritis days I hardly hold phone, one lightweight buttons still big enough hit
 I tried cameraphone last year buttons raised much small fingers kept slipping them
 And I never could figure get permanent prints pictures
It's certainly like "young" phones attach I-Pod, etc
 But price right good phone 57-year-old
 

There lot like little plain phone
 It gives great reception excellent sound quality
 Easy use
 Cheap
 Its good phone
 Easy slip pocket
It exciting phone
 The display washes bright light
 Only two themes wallpaper come phone 6 ringtones tones arent interesting
 No bluetooth
 It officially support connection computer data cable
Having said that, gets great reception great making receiving phone calls
 I enjoy using mine glad I bought one
 They found fairly cheap
 

I old Nokia 3650
 I ditch part AT&T; ( Cingular)
 I always liked Nokia audio quality functionality
I blackberry company last 12 months audio quality bad
 I hated blackberry
This nice phone sombody want make/receive calls
 Nice looks, small battery lasts lot longer expected
 It's great traveling forgotten charger
 It's free sign 2 year contract cingular
 

I like phone quite bit
 It really bells whistles expensive ones except camera (which I never used anyway)
 The main complaint I put pocket purse, numbers keypad get hit entered
 I locking phone I don't use (very easy do) won't happen
 If rings, I still answer it, I can't call locked
 I couldn't decide razr read many complaints razr didn't want get mixed phone seemed quite faults
 Navagation key also quite small isn't really big problem
 I like fact speaking headset also listening headset radio
 You take phone walks listening radio worry missing call
 




























This item works advertised older model specifically designed 6133 doesn't easily clip phone, kind force price still worth it

It great protecting Nokia 6682
 The hole upper corner front side unnecessary awkward
 With clip, phone becomes thick
 Fitting best
 

















































































































If device gymnast would slipped awkwardly pommel horse, ripping leotard, cracking leg dismount
 I thought niftiest thing town I bought it
 I display coiled exterior prominently desk hoping dorks would marvel admire it
 My phone, "charging", gone two bars mind-numbing, brown-out inducing, three bars 9+ hours
 Data: USB port charging directly motherboard devices daisy-chained connected port
 This phone battery go nothing fully charged 45 minutes AC
It works tightest pinches, it's disappointing performance
 

I love USB phone charger
 I use laptop always laptop plugged never battery
 It's charger I ever use anymore
 I wish one Nokia 3588
 That's new phone I wouldn't gotten phone I would realized don't USB charger series yet
 :(

This charger works really well
It's convenient you're away home office
 

I ordered according husband's phone list work all


 

I bought item, didn't work
 It doesn't charge nokia 6682
 I asked replacement
They kind enough send replacement, even charger doesn't work
Great service, bad product
 

The multifit charger sounds good big fit charger opening phone
 It would cost return buy new one
 









































































great phone come lots feathers u expect good nokia
one side it's size tat great phone 

Easy navigate wife loves it
 Short Battery though
 Can't beat price
 





































First I don't appreciate Nokia come proprietary connector force buy another adapter use 3rd party accessories
 Second, provide adapter allow use 3rd party accessories, make sure works properly
 The AD-46 really loud pop exiting menu ending call
 Feels like eardrums pop
 I returned soon I could
 Don't buy
 

I use Nokia 6126 (eventhough it's listed supported phone), it's perfect
 It lets connect phone car stereo throughPhilips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter
 In husband's car, I use FM transmitter send music phone radio adapter, works fine well
 Don't know I would without adapter, 'cause 2-year old son always requests favorite songs car, way, I always ready go phone
Also tried hooking phone old stereo home adapter aBelkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6ft), it's prefect
Good product, buy it

 

This accessory easy install gives full functionality AT&T; N75 phone I get incoming call
 I love access better play-calling NFL games/stadium
 Changing stations volume convenient--never touch phone radio function turned on
I use Body Glove brand hands-free headset AD-46, phone compatible brand would probably work
 

The surprise I needed push connector phone
 I expecting sort buttons sides connector depress slide place, releasing side buttons lock in
 There buttons
 You push pull out
 It doesn't go come easily, works great
 

No matter brand I tried I could get earbuds fit ear correctly
 (They worst thing ever invented) This adaptor wonderful
 It plugs right Nokia 6085 (shame Nokia stupid connector first place) I use set head phones I want
 Wonderful product
 

I've using adapter combined Nokia N73 year now, I've enjoyed it's use
 I problems though
1
 Cord long
2
 Clip fairly easy break
At point time, I'm using adapter clip, I shove pocket phone
 The bad part I keep accidentally hitting volume button biking
If I perfect adapter, I wouldn't use one


 (Waiting affordable N82

) But really, I'd want size plug clips bottom phone, 3
5mm jack it, time still allowing use microphone
 It'd take away cable problem, everything else
I recommend handy choice moment
 It's like 2004 election
 People weren't voting John Kerry
 They voting Bush
 

This product works advertised
 After trying many Bluetooth solutions always sync pairing issues, easy cheap solution good sound quality
 

It's good cheap alternative paying $40 pair special headphones Nokia 6126, length cord unit + length cord standard pair headphones combined


you cumbersome 9'(or more) cord deal with
 Other works exactly described job pretty well
 

Like reviewers, I disappointed Nokia using proprietary "pop-port" headsets
 In addition, Nokia branded headset I bought poor sound quality uncomfortable wear 5 minutes
 So I bought far it's good
Pro: cheaper Nokia bluetooth headsets, cable extension, plug clip clothingCon: longer cord necessary, sound quality perfect
 

great adapter, saves life
dont cut wire, 11 cables inside, hard repair
no quality loss 

I recently bought product found pretty good does
 The plus side connect headphones it
 However, minus side sound quality microphone
 It tends lack higher frequencies
 This could well product first kind NOKIA designed
 But, I think overall, it's good product
 Further more, I would buy directly (NOKIA)
 It's worth $29+
 

It works well allows Nokia phones strange POP port work standard set headphones
 It also works antenna FM radio
Even though nothing documentation enclosed Nokia web site says so, device DOES work Nokia N75 phone
 One caution, even thought description says "Americas Retail Pk" obvious packaged Europe instead
 

I like listen music Nokia 6085's MP3 player, I answer incoming call, chat, resume listening music one button
 It also rocker volume control side
 CAVEATS: (1)The pop-port connector stiff insert, takes getting used to
 (2)At first I thought I would return every phone keypad press would create incredibly annoying loud POP headphones
 Fortunately, problem (almost) eliminated editing spare profile silence "Keypad tones", assigning profile headphone mode
 

I bought unit nokia E61i
 But turns I bought simple one, e
g
 AD-15
First all, E61i FM
Secondly, I don't use volume buttons' line unit earplug always get twisted
The last important, whenever phone switch one song another one, big noise come earplug, it's terrible annoying
 

I Nokia E61, even thought E62 non pop port version available US I bought E61 freedom unlocked device use WiFi
 I Bought adapter I replace music player works great
 Replaces music player completely
 I use car cassette adapter sound quality excellent music calling (no complaints quality voice using integrated mic)
 It also provides great deal RF isolation avoid noise cellphone signaling call call
 Instead making review rant popport like prev reviewer, let praise adaptor great seller shipped device inmediatelly less two days got it
 

This really nice adapter have
 nokia didn't make buy adapter listen music

 work well also lets listed FM radio, acts antenna
 definately worth twenty bucks
 

This unit work, really stinks (this typical nokia), making even simplest things complex non-durable
 dont get it, get phone accepts standard audio jacks




 

If compatable Nokia phone, item must have
 Phones compattible product come lame headphones, can't use ordinary ones
 This product allows plug regular headphones Nokia Phone listen music favorite headphones
 It handy button answers calls, phone music player mode, button switches music player next song
 It also microphone hands free calling volume buttons
 The downside cord pretty long, combined cord headphones, VERY long, I wrap one twistie-ties
 

I looking good headset Nokia 6085 I use phone set alternative mp3 players
 I saw product decent deal site
 I quite happy product specially sound quality price
Pros: nice sound quality, disturbance body static


 easy use
Cons: earphone goes round neck

 sometime it's irritating searched earphone gets lost backside
Over all, good deal stuff nokia 6085 

I bought knowing makes cracking/popping sound whenever switch program on/off (ie, radio mp3)
 This nothing new since happens even pop port headphones (with super uncomfortable earphones)
 So it's pop port issue specific item
I also know cord pretty long good I keep phone far away I watch slingbox
 Or listen radio/mp3 running
Just don't like didn't controls mp3 player (pause/play/ ffw/rew)
 The volume rocker there, tho, that's good
 

bought AD-46 Head Phone HS-28 A1, basicly bought adapter connect phone car stereo system, listen music phone answer calls driving,the sound great, like much 































































































































































































































































































































































I bought replace holster I sat broke
 This holster fit phone
 It 1/4 inch long
 Trashed would cost postage return replace
 Needless say order another company
 

I bought easy holster use
 I find lock top part phone
 I regularly hit it, open phone, lost phone twice
 My holster Motorola phone designed way
 I stopped using holster
 

I used charger weeks noticed phone never gets full charge charger Nokia charger
 Also, charger came 2 round tips, 4 tips showed product advertisement image, probably image outdated
 




















This item listed NOKIA BLD-3R Extended Lithium Battery For Nokia rated 3
7V, 720mAh
 Yet picture plainly shows NOKIA BLD-3 battery rated 3
7V, 720mAh
 When I search Nokia's website inn't NOKIA BLD-3R battery, NOKIA BLD-3
 So exactly selling? 

This battery delivered promptly supplier
 I noticed significant improvement replaced battery several recharges
 Great value
 

This battery brought new life back phone
 I previously purchased "New" battery (low priced different vendor) worse current battery I using
 This battery doubled trippled phones life
 

Why spend $30 Radio Shack get cheap? :) It's battery all, fewer things life make happier phone doesn't die day
So, don't get new phone don't get new subscription
 Just get new battery
 And amazed discovering features old phone didn;t even know about


 














































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































A Jabra BT350 I tried work properly Nokia phone (to fair probably phone's poor compatibility Jabra's)
I decided try Nokia BH-700 headset works perfectly phone, including voice commands
I also really like holster I wear around neck driving
 I don't like keep headsets ear I'm phone, holster keeps headset easy reach (in front chest) driving
With headsets rest ear wear shirts pockets order keepthem within reach driving
The disadvantage compared Jabra, Nokia headset susceptible noise phone meter away headset
 The jabra less noise even several meters away
By way, cellphone car, please get headset already
 Driving holding cell phone dangerous others
 In many countries illegal talk phone without headset hands-free system driving
 





























































I got use Nokia 8801 laptop computers
Using phone: sound quality surprisingly good, better expected yet boomy bass clear treble, sound would stutter drop out, even phone close headset
 I tried several songs this
 I suppose could phone, web research suggests common problem using wireless bluetooth headsets
 It may bandwidth issue Bluetooth v1
2
With IBM X40, using included USB audio gateway: many fewer dropouts, still some--even though I sitting computer
Bottom line: probably ready prime time
 I also found uncomfortable - bit pressing ears - 5 minutes
 I wear mens' hat size M, headbands adjustable
 

Nokia managed fix nearly BH-501's flaws - 601 substantially better product almost every way
 Unfortunately Nokia introduced range new problems, I sure get round fixing 


 year so
The first major improvement it's tougher
 Nokia eliminated weak-spots bendy plastic adjacent earphones
 The curves around earphones BH-601 sturdy bars flexible plastic shock-absorbing rubber inserts
 They appearance able withstand great deal twisting bending
 That's good news I feeling I get weeks use device
The next major improvement obvious - they've added buttons
 Not quite many Jabra confusing BT620s, enough allow nifty new features
 In addition original volume controls select/power button track-skip controller
Oddly enough volume controls work different way BH-501
 They seem linked phone's volume control
 The two act independently rather (as BH-501) change single volume setting
Another neat feature first time Nokia noticed nobody likes lit like fairy-lights
 This device two LEDs adjacent standard Nokia charging port
 The blue light blinks show headset active green light blinks headset charge
 There lights visible side front
 That's good news people wish focus attention
It never occurred complain BH-501 could operate charging
 It seemed like small thing mention, that's another thing Nokia changed
 I'm sure I'd ever want talk charging charging wire plugged headset somewhat negates benefit wireless device
 It's nice thought though, I confirm works
And bad points: The reception range BH-601 seems considerably worse BH-501 (which excellent)
 In ideal circumstances BH-601 give 10 metres range Nokia 95 listening stereo audio
 In environment moderate low levels radio interference (e
g
 normal city street) signal often break unless I hold N95 almost adjacent headset
 I guess thicker plastic used make device absorbs lot signals
Speaking range, related issue device's ability recover interrupted signal
 Unfortunately it's good
 As I wandered around office building today, I noticed somebody operating photocopier nearby enough interrupt signal
 Also motor opens steel gate cycle-park put enough EMF completely cut connection
While brief interruption may acceptable face interference, problem device looses connection link stays lost
 The way re-connect power-down headset, re-boot it
 The phone appears detected fact link failed resulting complete silence
Another oddity stereo headset seems switch monaural mode every time call comes in
 A phone call always mono one advantages headset 2 earphones hear mono audio two ears once
 When use BT-601 talk phone left produces sound
 The right (which includes microphone) remains silent
It's also worth noting look styling product seems quite cheap
 It's better design BH-501 quality plastic molding poor, silvery insert either phones looks cheap
 That's sad I would willing pay slightly device elegant design
On whole BH-601 modest improvement ill fated BH-501
 It's definitely best Nokia stereo headset I've tried still long way go deliver headset I really deserve
 

I like headset looks job
Be sure charge headset use

MacBook1
 Simple pairing, I even asked passcode
2
 Using stereo mono option first gave static music, I disconnect/reconnect, worked fine
3
 Volume track controls work well iTunes
4
 I used mic GarageBand worked fine
5
 I tried using audio voice Yahoo
 Messenger won't work time (eh)
iPhone1
 I needed put passcode I paired devices, pairing's also relatively painless
2
 Works well iPod app, volume track controls work (eh)
3
 I tried Pandora works fine too
4
 If ringtones, won't hear music headset, regular ring
5
 Voice heard left side
I yet buy Bluetooth transmitter iPod Nano 5th gen I post update then

 




















































If looking simple elegant faceplate one you
How get anymore elegant pure white faceplate?You can't
If simple unique person want express simplicity simple way,buy faceplate
 

I've looking color
 It's easy install like Nokia 8290 faceplates
 If white color, great add-on phone
 


The product description says "Installation requires Torx T6 screwdriver, professional installation recommended
" This faceplate Nokia aftermarket "X-press On" cover simply snaps matter seconds
 The Torx screwdriver NOT required, professional installation hardly necessary
 My cat could probably opposable thumbs
The color cover great - purple seems glow bottom fades smoothly red
 It's expensive generic cheapo covers get online {a little money], quality much better, fit sleek perfect
 I'm enjoying much
 

cute easy install
 love it
 

worthwhile feature unit way looks
 phone sits crooked unit, lcd display confusing low tech
 discharge funtionality work unit ordered
 

If don't want plugging cell phone wall time would prefer able see display working (in case typing), desktop charger wonderful
 Another excellent feature battery drain: allows take NiCad LithIon battery completely drain it, charger automatically charge back up
 This necessary least 2 3 times life Nokia LithIon battery prolong life
 




























This recharger, contains 3300 mAH (&gt;3 times charge regular battery), great product
It compact (at least take plastic arrives in), lot juice, allows use phone charging battery (no need call cut middle battery dies - charge talk 
) it's job well
The problem product clear advantage Instant Power Disposable Battery Nokia Phones - charge closed special bag supplied package reused
This battery slight advantage usable without turning phone replacing battery, complex operate (connecting wire, monitoring charge light, etc) battery (a simple switch)
 

You'll glad got you're middle street, middle business call phone dying - plug Instant Charger keep talking
 And weekend, trekking woods, call home power outlet miles around - plug Instant Charger keep talking
You get picture - must cellular phone user, reliable works advertised
 

This faceplate makes phone unique
 Having 2 colors blend actually looks cool, better plain color
 The complaint I made plate green less orange
 It still cool though
 




















This purchased gift husband
 He says 'perfect' exactly needed
 I don't use it, seems well made sharp-looking case
 He picky accessories, clothing, etc
 - complaints, must good
 

It nice case
 Well design
 My wife loved except Treo 750 much smaller (or slimmer) 700, 680 etc
 When put Treo 750 case, Treo 750 sank bottom case
 Treo 750 outside antenna
 It easy "dig" phone out
 Still, nice case
 So, I put Canon Powershot camera carry around
 It fits
 














I received phone yesterday couldn't wait use based past great experices Nokia phone
However




After first couple hours exploring it




I found "cool" Nokia flip phone poor sound quality I driving highway




I tried talk friends without headset




they couldn't hear well



not old Sanyo 8100, perfect crystal clear sound even I driving windy days



it doesn't anything reception (as Nokia phones, reception great), everyone I asked responded I get different phone



If normally don't use phone you're driving



then great phone you're person like like talk friends even you're freeway




please think twice




 

I thought pretty good nuts bolts phone
room improvement
1
 speaker needs louder
2
 headset things shouldn't sound like tin can
My phone died 2 months
 I found condensation inside
 I work outside alot phone never got wet
 I believe condensation killed it
 The interior phone sealed
 

There isn't anything impresses phone
 The backlight remains less five seconds, unless you're pressing one phone's keys, isn't option remain predetermined amount seconds
Without backlight on, external main display nearly impossible read
 The phone eight ring tones preloaded, perhaps two intolerable
 Both phone's still video capturing relies largely lots light, yet expected, won't replace stand alone camera camcorder
Reception perfect, rather opinion great reception accreditation T-mobile's network believe Nokia phones offer superior reception, opinion latter
 The FM radio works well, great extra feature
 The phone latest bells whistles cell phones, minus Bluetooth upgradeable memory
 While Nokia 6101 end quest perfect cell phone, suffice continue never ending quest
 

Nokia always "candybar" phonemaker choice, flip phones nothing pass over
 I received 6101 T-Mobile I quite impressed
 It light, well designed strong hinge, materials good quality
 The things I like phone user interface, display camera
 I feel Nokia needs improve features order ramp phones standards makes like Motorola
 But all, still great choice
===UPDATE===After week regular use, phone froze
 I turned took battery, turned back on
 This happened 3 times
 It working ringer working
 I dissapointed, I returned phone T-Mobile I waiting new Motorola v360
 I give phone 3 stars, T-Mobile helpful customer service fantastic
 

I like phone
 It's first camera phone, I don't much compare to
 The picture quality ok, camera PHONE
 

Just got phone wife
 She "technically challenged" phone great her
 It large numbers making easy call people
 The on/off buttons colored green/red easily figure turn on/off
 The display clear bright simple icons making easy select phonebook pick names people call
 With previous phone, could never figure part out, typed every number time called someone
 I give phone 4 stars however since builtin camera FM radio present major challenges I serious doubts ever figure use them
 Nokia make phone complete idiot use, I would need tech support
 Thank god Apple iMac iSync well, since allows update sync phonebook
 

I've several Nokia's phones never disappointed now
 When using hands-free headset, whoever I talking sounded liked talking tin can
 Since I use hands-free set majority time I'm phone, big problem
 The problem I found phone powerful vibrate mode
 I sometimes even hear sitting desk next me
 The one plus phone (other Nokia's easy-to-use menus) that's it's light compact
 Because problem hands-free set, I exchange Motorola V360
 This phone bit heavier, much better sound quality vibrate mode
 

I've phone less month finish already chipping off
 You position perfectly ear order hear properly
 Other that's, it's ok
 It seems cheaply made
 

How I start ?OK, let start saying If I handset test engineer product, I would hung passing substandard handset Quality Assurance process
T-Mobile let upgrade old Sony Ericsson T-610 crap
 Good Reception decent camera redeemable features
 Voice quality sucks
 It inaudible even pin drop silence surroundings
 Switching Loudspeaker blurrs audio
 No Bluetooth connectivity
 Headset quality poor
 This handset doesnt seem games well
 The screen fonts archiac tasteless
The Address book different options new contact, Home, Cell, Work General
 By default new contact number stored General
 Will somebody tell General phone ? Additionally, number Mobile / Home/ Work numbers single contact crap wont even throw error message
 Further, click name contact, his/her name appears twice next screen along phone number
 Why name appear twice? What waste memory

 Also, painful see "My Album" "My Journal" listed defaults contact list
The Call listing feature pathetic
 If want see recent call list, click three different buttons: One calls placed, one calls you've received one calls you've missed
Suppose add new number contact list, call list automatically update new contact
 So call list continue show numbers instead contact name
Further, set phone 'Silent' mode would like change Normal, actually get whole bunch options including 'Silent'
 Why anybody want switch Silent mode Silent mode

 If examine handset find numerous instances redundancy memory wastage
 The programmers developed software handset ought fired
Additionally, key pad user friendly
 The Sent messages item save sent messages default
 Furthermore, type message wont know enter special characters since screen offer clue
 You figure way out
 Let give secret
 You press * key enter special character
Not worth upgrading phone definately worth buying
 You probably better phones
 

I posting I'm sure reviewers work Nokia
 After reading sparkling reviews, I waited anticipation Nokia 6101, COMPLETELY UNDERWHELMED phone
 My spouse I bored hour
 Keeping mind cell phone immediately preceding one black Motorola Razor that, Motorola V300- Nokia even hold candle either phones
 The Nokia screen teeny blurry, screen font sans serif (think Mac computer circa 1989) "print quality" photos joke
 The reception fine, phone lacking pizzazz
 It basic, fine you're market for
 I wouldn't actually pay money phone
I going give phone another days (to give Nokia reception prowess chance impress) unless it's huge difference, I return Tmobile another Razor
 In terms size like old Motorola V60
 The FM radio works fine
Step up, Nokia
---I revising review days use
 What phone lacks looks makes reception
 There area hill home never ot ANY reception old Motorola V300 Razor
 The Nokia picks signal area reception clear be
 I would revise three 1/2 stars
 

Overall I think pretty good phone
 This first experience owning camera phone, I upgraded motorola v66
 I primarily chose phone favorite feature


 voice activation dialing (which comes handy driving)
I rated phone 4 stars fairly simple use easy setup
 I virtually able setup features I wanted (personal wallpaper, screen savers, ring tones, caller id, voice activation) without even opening user's manual
 The reception good better old phone I hear people clearly end line
Now room improvement:-The pictures often grainy unless BRIGHT lighting (such sunlight)
 Because first camera phone I don't know normal subpar (use real camera want nice pictures)
-The downloadable ring tones sound clear phone sample website (perhaps websites lessen quality sound?)
-The navigational buttons take getting used to
 It basically square within square, confusing TOP left right hand corners square button correlate BOTTOM left right hand corners screen respectively
 Perhaps won't bother much, constantly tripping (it seems bottom corners button correlate bottom corners screen)
-The annoying feature (some may see plus) screen reset main screen flip phone shut
 If somewhere deep menus phone, must remember push button clear screen close phone, otherwise open phone hours later, still detailed screen last time opposed main screen (like I said, people may like feature


 I hate it)
Because quirks minor probably personal, I recommend phone others
 

If you're already accustomed Nokia phones probably ignore review
 If you've used phones, buyer beware 
 
 
I've used older Samsung phone past five years
 Archaic terms current features
 Then I upgraded even changed providers
 My first new phone Samsung E335
 It easy use, screens crisp clear, accepted standard accessories (e
g
 2
5mm headset)
 Unfortunately, I forced change Samsung, according T-Mobile rep, recently begun use internal antennas (which 335 has) phone far weak signal needs
So came Nokia 6101
 It fantastic reception
 And it's intuitive use, times, DOS Windows 3
1
 Menu items logically placed frequently takes multiple buttons get single feature
 The navigation buttons top frustrating use
 They basically consist square within square
 This frequently results hitting wrong button
 The screens, working fine, also nearly clear I've seen phones I've used
After using Samsung E335 (and phones others - older C225 unknown Motorola) I feel like I'm walking quicksand get I'm going
 This perception confirmed Consumer Reports recently rated several dozen phones 
 
 
 ranked Samsung, Motorola phones "very good" terms ease use ranked Nokia "good
" Wished I seen article purchasing
Perhaps one annoying aspects phone Nokia's proprietery accessory connection
 You can't go eletronics store dept
 pick ol' 2
5mm headset
 You one works specifically Nokia
 If you're kind expandable mike comes around face (the kind might see operators telemarketers using) might luck
 I've yet find one fit 6101
On good side, I get access FM radio, feature I really really wanted
 As low-res video, I didn't really need it
 The camera average
 This phone also tri-band coverage makes fairly flexible
 Still, I'm sure phone worth hassle
 If I found Samsung Motorola features price I wanted I would get rid 6101 heartbeat
 

This review comes full month hunting phone trying figure things out
 And secondly, I'm using phone coming Motorala V300
Pros:Phone light easy carry
When menu close reopen phone, position saved
 I kind like this
Love Voice Message (not voicemail, 1 minute messages send users)Radio quality nice
Emoticons available text messaging
Cons:About users claim sound quality bad hard hear: I must say, need carefully position speaker ear
Loudspeaker quality somewhat lacking could louder (but I don't really use speaker phone much)
 MP3 ring tones transfered V300 sound like crap
Screen also smaller V300Menu animations "cartoony" lower quality
And number one pain phone: NO IN CALL TIMER???? Please, someone correct I'm wrong, I've searched searched found nothing
 Is phone rich? Some us need know long we've phone call
All all, phone phone
 All depends it
 If you're coming V300 like myself, may want look another phone
 But, it's acceptable me
 

This 3rd Nokia phone
 My first two phones candybar style, I tried V300 Motorola, decided give Nokia another try
 The Nokia/T-Mobile combination best far
 I notice great improvement clarity since switching Motorola
 I AT&T; (Cingular) two Nokia candybar phones I definitely think T-Mobile Nokia together make difference
Likes:-Easy use buttons-Camera night mode-Large display-Sleek designDislikes:-Handsfree headset came (I always hear echo, maybe I'm using right?)-Video (does night mode videos dark)-Ringtones (limited selection)-Hard see missed calls received messages outside display
 There's tiny little icon display lit hard see it
Haven't tried FM radio yet I can't comment feature
Overall, I pretty happy phone
 I problem week ago outgoing calls, volume would drop people would sound far away I called T-Mobile "reset" phone would find nearest tower
 The issue happened since I'm still process troubleshooting see it's SIM card phone itself
 

I got phone I signed tmobile still pleasently surprised
Design:The Nokia 6101 arguably attractive phone market
 The glossy black silver colloring mirrored surfaces outside give phone amazing, eye-catching design
 Open phone interior nearly perfect well spaced symmetrical keys
 Though number keys nothing labeled, gives inside phone simple attractive look
 The keys tad slippery tactile phone general nearly perfect terms looks
Screens:The external screen one biggest market, downside shows little 4000 colors awfully grainy washed out
 It good job acting self portrait display, making entire screen viewfinder
 Another downside set photo caller ID, displays tiny little picture caller barely recognize
The internal screen perfect size size phone
 It kind grainy washed also one easiest see sunlight
 It job isn't great
Camera:The picture quality little sub par, really crisp vivid, lof extra features edit play pictures huge plus
 There several choices sizes pictures shared memory phone goes quickly everything do, lower setting camera may help
The video scores points able record 16 sec, quality yet isn't perfect, sent computer quality pretty crappy
 However trick phone
Extras:The addition speakerphone welcome, quality pretty good
 But personally I felt volume little low speaker car, trick perfectly sitting home
The FM radio welcome addition, even though MP3 player would way desireable
 You preset 20 stations really reception good given phone small already pretty featured packed
 On downside, sound quality perfect earphones pretty uncomfortable, unfortunately since requires earphones get reception, can't get another pair
Pros: Amazing, eye-catching design sleek, light attractive
 Speakerphone FM radio
 Large external display
Cons: Displays little washed out
 Uncomfortable earphones FM radio, MP3 player
 Shared memory goes fast
Overall: Great design out, decent speakerphone features, even though screens lackluster
 

This phone packed features camera radio, comes storage it's reliable
 I find frequently deleting unneeded games, wallpapers, ring-tones make room more
 Also, I got October last month screen froze similar computer it's simply un-useable
 So, let lay flat
 It's gorgeous phone easy love but, I I'd look little settling
 

Unless planning making occasional phone calls device without holding many contacts personalizing ringtone, phone you, especially price
 The lack internal memory prevents saving handful games, pictures, ringtones, text messages without causing lock due "lack internal memory"
 There many better phones available better prices, especially T-Mobile To Go customer
 If use To Go, purchase terrible phone (like this, cheaper) SIM card, upgrade Unlocked Phone Amazon
 You won't nearly frustrated (unless try download T-Zones, hassle, I would rather phone able download) I been, wasting money downloads discover won't fit in, even I barely anything phone
 Unless customization control phone (instead way around) aren't you, run away NOW
 

I upgraded phone two months ago Motorola V300 model I wanted radio larger keypad
 After one month, radio longer worked, battery dies claims fully charged, takes three tries get connect making call, sometimes phone freaks resets you're middle texting surfing web
 It's flimsy
 I've V300 two years everything still works it
 The Nokia 6101 lot issues
 

Coming "freebie" phone Verizon gave us - LG 4400 - phone, Nokia 6101, letdown
 I expected Nokia
I phone three days far
 The phone functionality seems work good, I hear fine, good signal strength whatnot
 So OK
 The form factor nice
 It pretty good size, seems pretty durable
 The black show fingerprints/smudges easily
But I couple big problems
1
 The backlight doesn't stay long enough, even brightly lit room impossible see screen backlight goes off
 There way increase backlight timeout - easy keey press turn backlight back without possibly messing doing
 On *free* LG phone I could change timeout longer value, disable together leaving light time (hurting battery life obviously)
2
 There quick way switch silent mode
 You set shortcut keys, silent mode
 So go silent mode to: Open phone, press "Go-To", Scroll 4 times, press "Select"
 That open phone press 6 keys - I could one external keypress *free* LG flip phone
And finally, like Nokia Series 40 phones, Macintosh support
 Nokia support Macintosh, Apple iSync yet support series 40 phones, none third party products yet supports 6101


 

This great phone
 The basic features easy use, buttons useful size
The phone small light, battery performs well
This one came recharge dongle allowed reuse old Nokia recharger phone spare
The extra features brilliant
 Camera works easily takes little movies
 I really like radio too
For money I think best phone around moment (2006)
 

great phone complaints 

This phone awesome great features

 I year hasn't given problem ONCE

 The ringtones AWESOME

 The camers quality great cool games fun order
 This phone really lets show style features let pick phone colors online shopping ringtones wallpaper
 It lets adjust phone volume AND ringtone volume liking t-zones online shop best artists songs gets everyone dancing, like Rihanna, Chamillionare A LOT MORE



 So, want reliable phone lets personalize you, many cheap plans choose from, get Nokia 6101 Phone ( T-Mobile course
) it's best

 

I always fan Nokia- I feel best phone company ever
 I thinking buying new camera phone, I came across beautiful Nokia flip phone model I fell it
 I would higly recommend phone
 It beautiful design, light, wonderful camera video phone bonus feature- FM radio
 Great workout sessions


It doesn't bluetooth
 But whatever - dont get everything one phone, you? I get great reception enjoy handsfree headset listening music talking I driving thats I need great value buck



If thinking buying phone, buy Nokia 6101


NK 

I bought 2 phones t-mobile year ago daughter's motorola v300 died needed replacement
 I actually pay them, shipping, take 2 year contract instead previous one year paln, definitely good bargain
 The reason I still 400 min
 $50 month plan nobody else offered - Verizon Cingular wanted $70/month, even payng phones, T-mobile cheaper
 Obviously terrible customer service, get pay for
 The last statement doesn't apply Nokia 6101 though
 If I gotten money back may worth trouble, pay it, so


The first thing happened kid's phone death radio
 Since teenager highest priority, return phone (and pay shipping) get replacement
 The replacement phone still working radio, it's side volume button broke months
 My daughter "customized" otside phone glu-on pearly stuff then, could get replacement
 Which ok hates phone looking forward next year get different one
 Since Motorola survived almost another year, started using Nokia I hate too
1
 The call disconnect buttons oposite motorola
 why? need relearn new habits every time get new phone?2
 The vibe option useless
 And daughter's constant excuse answering I call her
 And far I haven't found vibe ring option available even side button motorola
3
 I still haven't figured use speed dial
 For teh phone allows assign numbers 1-touch dial option (up nine phone numbers), allow speed dial numbers 11 99, unlike Motorola give number storing contact
 All I make call dial two digits pound key
 Very handy driving
4
the nokia 8 ringtones
 8
?
 If I 9 speed dial numbers I least many ringtones know supposedly important contacts calls me
 I look collar ID I want know importnat answer phone call
 And none tones acceptable
 My pager better selection


 I person would pay ringtones, I may end it, irritating
5
 The manus far intuitive
 I never look Motorola's manual
 It easy use phonebook, setup pictuer wallpaper, assign ring-tones contacts, etc
 The Nokia constant irritation
 I unable asign ringtone contact phone number lot ringtone choose from
 There plenty options I can't fugure even exist many options lead screen
 Worst phone stays last screen using even close it


 set alarm morning, go back screens make phone call, can't close re-open phone
I don't know designed t-mobile "crippled" many people saying features phone
6
 And pertinent ALL cell phones
 Why earth wouldn't come cable connect computer? You look right cable still doesn't work I doubt really costs much since ALL pdas palms come one anyway
The positive thing better reception Motorola far hasn't droped calls
 Overall wouldn't recommend phone see it's offered Amazon anymore
 If put bells whistles well, make generic phone
 

first t-mobile go phone, thought great first 2 months things started wrong camera first started saying memory full, deleted stuff use, took took back
 Once another CRAPYPhone Nokia
 DONT BUY THIS PHONE , worth money
 

This first cell phone, I full 3 months homeless person stole me
 If I ever saw man again, I would thank him
 I hated phone much, I could never justify buying new one since I already one
 First all, main complaint phone lack memory
 I total 5 ringtones downloaded, 1 video, 6 pictures phone
 It annoying everytime I wanted take new picture send picture message I would get "Memory Full" message
 Second all, it's possible put individualized ringtone certain person contact list
 To this, must first create new group, add person group, choose ringtone group
 This course takes memory

 Another complaint I phone backlight would automatically go 10 seconds inactivity
 This got nuisance, way change far I could tell
 Also vibration feature phone weak
It practically pressed skin even feel it
 This caused miss lot calls text messages
 Speaking which, call missed say "1 missed call" wont say who
 Then go missed call list see was
 The goes receive text message
 One thing I like phone however, rang loud
 You could easily hear crowded area
 So conclusion:Pros:Rings LoudlyCons:Low MemoryHorrible VibrationLow quality camera even worse videos
Text message autocomplete horribleLow Memory ( I know it's twice
 that's bad is)I've never happier Samsung t509 

I bought phone hopes overcoming weak T-Mobile signal
 I couldn't use old cell phone office places I frequent
 The Nokia 6101 definitely good purchase meet needs
 I sit desk work conversation without problem
 It also many "extras" people come expect today - camera, radio, voice dialing, loudspeaker, etc
 My complaints: loudspeaker feature activated placed call radio works plug headset acts antenna
 

I got phone T-mobile free last week
 I tried find make sound lounder
 I barely hear I talk phone
 I went back store find what's wrong said it's normal
 It's easy tell phone lower normal compare another cell phone price
 So far phone froze 4 times
 I'm thinking take back week
 I would rather pay money get phone hear talk don't take battery screen frozen
 

Much better reception one I replaced - Nokia 3595
 I got bar 3595 4 bars 6101
 Camera OK, VGA
 The clock digits front panel small though
 New battery runs 7 days standby
 

The part top listen little low even volume turned way up
 The radio actually pretty good it's almost like walkman
 The camera doesn't take amazing pictures, fine
I wish options zoom (even though pic, doesn't stay way) things flash choice hi med lo resolution
 The video extremely grainy pixely definitely expect quality it's something really want record don't access don't want drag camcorder
 The bad thing says mp3, hold phone's mic speaker set ringtone
 I tried I wasn't expecting anything magnificent absolutely terrible, screechy tinny sounded like wounded mouse pop can
 The phone looks nice, black silver
I like nice external display
 It infrared port also EDGE pretty good features
 

Hi there, phone 8 months molding around front face plate & around atenna come undone ( phone husbands) Which means multiple dropped calls signal half time
 Went T-mobile problem stated would consider physical damage replace it, For $100 ea
 phone could upgrade
 Well didn't expect phones come undone 8 mos
 don't extra couple hundred dollars go ahead upgrade, POOR customer service T-MOBILE
 

Don't buy phone
 Yeah it's free tmobile
com phone raggedy
 This Nokia's worse phone ever made
 The phone cutting reason
 The memory low ringtones loud sometimes unclear
 The camera doesn't show clearly battery goes quick vibrate
 Also, put phone earpiece ear right place can't hear person
 I never used ugly headset
 Just don't buy [


] 

I've always Nokia phones worked well
 So I looking new phone saw Nokia come flip, I knew I try out
 I glad I went ahead got phone
 It absolutely wonderful
 It great, stylish, sturdy look it
 Not cheap looking feeling all
 The inside display nice bright, I really like outside display well
 The buttons large easy press
 Plus well backlit cool blue light
 The reception phone amazing
 I get better reception certain areas phone I previous phone
 Volume call clarity great
 I worried volume due reviews I'd read, problems hearing people all
 I think people complaining volume may holding speaker exactly ear, hold little course you're going hear well
 Just hold phone correctly you'll problems
 People end think I'm calling land line sounds clear
 Nokia put antenna left hand side, unlike almost every phone there, great get way hand you're talking
 The size phone big small
 Plus it's really light
 Mine came good selection ring tones, easy download new ones want variety
 The menus extremely intuitive easy use
 The camera job me, I want use put images background main mini displays
 I want phone good phone first anything else one job
 The extra bells whistles bonuses make phone better
 The phone convenient volume camera buttons sides
 These small way enough I accidently press them, unlike phones I hear problem
 All around fantastic phone I highly recommend it
 

Of several cell phones I've owned years, I've always got best service Nokia brand phones
 Particularly areas signal low, always seem pull best reception without dropping calls
 The 6101 exception
With flip design, able get earpiece closer ear - makes easier hear callers voice non-flip style phone
 The display bright easy see - even bright light
 The speakerphone seems louder previous Nokias I've owned
 The camera works well
 All functions feel identical non-flip Nokias
The construction phone seems solid flip phones
 So far I dropped 6101 concrete, tiled bathroom floor without crack case, even scratch
The thing I find disappointing ringer selection T-Mobile model
 I would rather standard ringer "noise" song, doesn't seem exist pre-installed
 

I got 6101 first cell phone I say it's pretty cool
 The functions phone great, it's easy use plenty customisable features play with
 The camera excellent cell phone deals low light situations easily
 The case looks real cool, buttons work well, phone strong vibrate feature
 The outside screen nice big, good caller ID
 Having ability put one wallpaper main screen another outside screen also plus
 Overall phone works well nice have
There major problems phone, ear piece one
 The phone one tiny hole ear piece keep phone one position face hear anybody speaking
 The phone slips easily watch put it
The main problem phone it's durability
 Within less month, phone started degrade
 The battery came loose easily I would repeatedly find phone randomly pocket
 I also noticed top part (screen) phone started wiggle litte
 All things I put little annoyances decided keep phone
 I lived peacefully happily 6101 one day I pulled pocket make phone call found front screen phone cracked half provocation all
 The next day I took phone upgraded V3 Razr I'm happy say phone better
 There significant loss camera quality Razr 6101, that's worthy loss phone fall apart pocket
The 6101 cool little phone works well, falls apart without reason
 Go Razr something else
 

This phone sucks
 Your likelihood brain cancer greatly increased phone ear plug comes unplugged time end, don't even bother use ear plug
 Terrible design
 Don't know could make bad design
 

THis phone torture death
 THe keys rust really easily, amazingly SUCKY
 $150?
?
?
?
?
?
?
WHO THE HECK WOULD BUY THIS??????Call quality SUX
 

I bought phone March 2006 replaced June 2006 simply died
 The replacement phone better, charger works 3 weeks choice purchase another simply stops working
 I disappointed phone I recommend waste money it
 I sorry I did
 

I owned Nokia 6101 since late October 2005
 I absolutely love it


 I wouldn't trade world
 My boyfriend even wanted trade tom get Motorola Razr V3 like has, it's set great perks, I love phone
 There games (with room download), camera quality great clarity, FM radio works perfectly (and great passer time), great reception T-Mobile's GSM network
 You also use recorder record ringtones
 It's great



 

This phone suffers defect Nokia mid high end phone; Raging mediocrity
It normal phone functions decently
It screen ok
The rings loud, call audio lower phones
Reception isn't really problem don't recall phones Nokia _bad_ reception
The screen slightly better similar priced Motorola's, good Samsungs
Some high points:Large buttons
Large Screen
Newer menu, still easy use
Lows:Domestic tri-band (850/1900 US, 1800)New, thin power port Nokia's 

I got phone months ago narrowly escaping suckered super-cool looking crappy functioning Motorola Razr
 Nokia phones, experience, sturdy, reliable, simple, phone lives brand name
 It's sleek sturdy, easy use decent quality features like built-in camera/video, sound quality best one expect cell phone
 I've already dropped couple times problems yet (fingers crossed:)Definitely ideal flip-phone someone wants good quality, well-functioning nice looking phone
 

I recently purchsed phone much better last one I had
 The problem i've far froze fixed putting battery back in
 

I would've given phone 3 half stars gave choice
I think 7th phone I mean, it's pretty good it's suppose do
 Come on, people, phone
 If want MP3 player, get MP3 player


 want camera

 get camera
 For intended use, pretty decent phone
 I making comparisons older phones review judge yourself
PROS:1
 Good reception- Nokia always known good reception awesome battery life
 Well, one doesn't fall short rest
 I able hear clearly drop call even places I one bar bars
 In fact, Samsung E715 phone

 would even drop call around places two bars
2
 Good battery life- Like I said before, Nokia known battery life
 I Nokia 6800 battery life phone pretty good doesn't seem good phone
 I talked phone hour first day left laying around 3-4 days battery bar drop one bar
3
 The price phone excellent
 Where could find deal camera


 video playback, speaker phone?4
 The speakerphone function actually bad
 If decently quiet room background noise, hear caller fine
 I don't know would speakerphone crowded place


 You don't Nextel Boost Mobile

 T-mobile we're talking about
 cannot even hear caller well conditions, maybe it's phone problem
5
 The ringtones come phoone actually decent
 I actually enjoyed them

 And clarify

 THIS PHONE IS NOT A MP3 PLAYER
 It play MP3 ringtones

 means used like ipod
 If want ipod badly

 get ipod
6
 It's pretty good job Nokia considering first flip phone
 It seems pretty sturdy

 unless going drop hundred times
 But phone going survive kind brutality
7
 Good thing T-Mobile phones give free headset phone
 This helps tremendously since cannot listen radio without headset
CONS:1
 Like many people stated before

 memory phone sucks
 I think 3MB use

 really isn't much
 But you're going downloading hundred things onto phone, it's big deal
 And really really need download bunch games play everywhere go, might well get gameboy PSP
2
 The annoying Nokia tone t-mobile tone cannot deleted ringtones section
 Everything else comes deleted
 it's two annoying tones pretty much unable delete
3
 The T-zones button gets hit really easily
 I don't know anyone else problem
 But tons times I go open flip closing while

 reason

 it's t-zones page
 I think problem button select t-zones close edge close flip, it's easy trigger it
4
 No bluetooth
 For phone jammed packed stuff, bluetooth whatsoever
 I've never bluetooth phone may matter cannot live without bluetooth

 isn't phone you
5
 There somethings design phone make sense me
 First all, want set caller ID someone taken picture, cannot simply go picture set it

 go contact name add detail in
 This annoying since previous camera phones, go picture want select there
 Also, like someone else said, button goes straight vibrate
 The # sign * sign don't even put phone silent, pretty annoying
6
 EDIT: I downloaded ringtones t-zones section
 Just warning everyone

 ringtones I downloaded sound absolutely horrible
 It hurt ears listen them
 And it's 2 bucks one ringtone
 So use t-zones download ringtones
7
 Unlike many Nokia phones, Nokia awesome changeable faceplates
 In fact, change faceplate phone, you'd probably get Ebay requires use T6 screwdriver order change it

 worth hassle
Overall, don't fooled negative reviews read
 Sure, phone flaws

 every phone
 The thing remember suppose cell phone all-in-one kind deal
 The camera decent camera phone
 Not best I've good enough
 And far, I pretty satisfied it
 

I thorough search Nov
 2005 examined many phones service providers selecting "Nokia 6101" T-mobile
 Other providers flexibility prepaid system meet needs
 This phone everything I looking easy operate use
 I love camera video easy operate
 I quickly grasped "how tos" making, receiving calls, text messaging
You store 16 MB information, send photos via email friends create photo albums
 The text messaging system super
 The Voice Mail bit complicated set due lack experience discomfort high tech equipment
 I used minutes unnecessarily listening T-mobile prompt telling Voice Mail I realized "information only" call
 It dawned I read reread manual enough I finally went Nokia T-mobile websites detailed precise directions
 I finally got right
The SIMS chip placement straight forward, difficulty battery either
 Activating phone receiving phone number cinch
 However getting 1000 minutes upload *was* bit hassle, I bought card could directly uploaded
 The help number T-mobile set straight
 I locked monthly plan choose prepay minutes
 I found T-mobile offers convenient method options obtaining 1000 minutes last whole year whatever don't use rolls buy next 1000 minutes
 {I talk much need phone safety short interval calls
] Other service providers complicated methods buying using minutes, lot add-on costs
 It easy
 I love phone
 I enjoying extra features I imagined
 It *just* phone - communication device makes feel connected world
 This phone works best me
 [Planning next buy headset use FM Radio 


] Erika BOrsos (erikab93) 

I made leap mobile technology purchase, I can't make comparisons products here
 But I prefer think make review objective
I've phone exactly week point I couldn't happier it
 It compact, yet packed useful features
 The black silver casing stylish professional looking, well blue backlight
 The buttons sensibly positioned easy use
 The menus intuitive I yet crack open instruction book
 My initial charging time 90 minutes, 12-24 hours manual promises
 The battery lasted good 5 days attempt restricting usage
 The reception crystal clear, I get 3-4 bars everywhere I go, single dropped call yet
Many reviewers complain low speaker volume, I solved problem (as reviewers suggested) experimenting position speaker ear
 People also complain 6101's limited memory, I haven't come yet
 I'm sure kind voluminous data folks jamming phones
Just I thought couldn't get better, I tried included earbuds FM radio
 This excellent feature, I love earbuds double hands-free headset worked beautifully car without worrying placing microphone properly near mouth
 I don't know Nokia managed this


it must done magic
I took away one star camera function
 The pictures look great long I don't try put computer, everyone says, want camera, buy camera, phone
 Live learn
 Also 8 provided ringtones, one cheesy sounding last
 A little selection without ponying extra $$ would nice
I really, really wanted Motorola Razr, every site I looked full reviews saying thing: form, function
 What good's phone pretty look doesn't it's supposed to? The 6101 impressed suitably make Nokia customer life (knock wood)
Update: Had phone 2-1/2 weeks now
 I accidentally cracked tiny part plastic hinge area opening it
 This made silver trim come loose bend right angle upward
 Nokia claims "limited warranty" doesn't cover poor workmanship
 Bad form
 They still need little work clamshell construction, clearly
 Would take away half star this
 

I've Nokia 6101 week
 It operates well good reception
 Voice mail e-mail easy use
 Overall, I'm pleased
Pros:* The unit small light
 It comes lithium ion battery take charge time (does require full discharge preserve battery life like older NiCad batteries)
* The keys large easy use
 The menu system highly configurable
 Shortcuts easy set up
* You send receive text pictures to/from anyone e-mail address
* Besides e-mail, phone infrared port, users exchange info PC directly via wireless infrared (no cable necessary)
* Reception voice quality acceptable
 The handset acceptable volume volume adjustable
* The phone comes bunch nifty extras like voice recorder, stopwatch, FM radio, camera (stills moving video)
Cons:* The camera works well standard bright light, it's good low light levels
 Also, doesn't zoom
 So I would say Nokia 6101 camera substandard compared cameras phones digital cameras
* After stop pressing keys, phone's lighted screen stays 10 seconds 30 seconds depending menu level
 Then everything goes black
 You push key (any key) get light back on
 There way adjust (that I found)
 This nuisance you're learning use phone, it's big deal you're familiar menus quickly clicking various menus
I read comments say phone cheaply made, cheap looking
 I disagree
 It sleek silver black outer case, seems reasonably sturdy
 The buttons nice firm feel
 But course, tiny lightweight phone (only 3
4 ounces)
 The casing made thin plastic (I suppose) back cover flanges could crack back cover removed roughly forced incorrectly position
 So


um


 Don't that
 The phone hold well standard handling
It works advertised
 It worth price
 I'm satisfied
 

OK, one absolutely great thing phone weak signal reception
 This phone hold call good clarity way better several Motorolas Samsungs I've tried T-Mobile
Now stupid stuff
The backlight stays 14 sec
 way adjust it
 You really can't see display backlight off
 Really annoying trying listen to/send voice mails
All key presses stay display unless specifically clear display
 It doesn't clear automatically close flip
 This ID theft issue use phone pay credit card bills, mortgage payments etc, don't clear display, loose phone
But big screwup tiny little pinhole opening ear speaker
 This people complain volume
 The actual volume fine, pinhole opening that's probably 5-10% surface area phones
 Talking several people phone, bothers apparently depends shape ear's pinna
 That's outside ear
 If don't opening positioned directly ears canal, can't hear worth crap
 If opening touches skin outside ear, it's like holding thumb speaker, simply can't hear
 I one ears
 This incredibly annoying caused return phone
 Almost phones I've seen several openings speaker, I don't problem
 

I recieved Nokia 6101 (which essentially hardware 6102) cell phone t-mobile 2 days ago early impressions phone:Pros:- The great reception nokia phones: My appt recieve great coverage t-mobile phones work ones Nokia
 I used 6610 6230 problems reception 6101
- IRDA sync data: I IBM laptop IRDA build in
 So convinent use Nokia PC Suite sync phone outlook
- Supports Mp3 ringtonesCons:- No Bluetooth: Unlike 6230 6101/6102 bluetooth
- Limited memory: I understand Nokia include external memory card slot, music player compatibility phone
 If play Mp3 ringtones surely play mp3s, would great add 512 MB card play music go
- Size Weight: The phone bit bulky heavier flip phones much becomes uncomfortable carry around- Different charger: For reason Nokia different charger phone
 So chargers older models Nokia compatible
Overall I think nice cell business use
 For entertainment such, I think 6230 still Nokia leader
 

I read reviews I bought phone
 After I read review I concern since reviews really good
Finally I still decided get one I trust Nokia
Now I used phone three months, I LOVE IT Absolutely
 Now I'd like give comments
First all, reviews really NOT reasonable, complain there's bluetooth phone, come on, buy, know NOT bluetooth phone, right? complain? You also complain PDA phone even there's bluetooth
This phone metal finished, comared metal-finished phone, looks like it's good, phone well made
 I used three months, it's still like new, chipping off
This phone's voice quality volume good
 Some guy complain it's clear
 Actually need put phone right position, ear, everything it's ok
 We get used phones, buy new phone, need adjust habbit little
 After several days use, I put phone right position without problem
Some guy complained phone difficult use, example, need press 6 times reach 'silent' option
 This absolutely wrong
 That's original setting
 This phone provide quite flexible personalized menu button option
 You re-define button's funtion
 It's useful
Your re-define 4 navigation button (left,right,up, down) funtion like provide 1-click access
 For example, I define 4 buttons 'alarm clock, calculator, games,phone book'
 You also refine "Goto" menu, contents order
 I define 'goto' menu 'meeting, normal, missed call, recevied calls



' since frequent function I use
 You even define 'exit' button ( button right bottom screen) seldom phones provide re-define it
 After take define buttons, feel phone right convinient you
Don't feel reception problem
The alarm clock funtion fantastic
 It provides 'graduate' wake means increases alarm sound gradually won't shocked
 Plus I define 1-click funtion, favorite alarm clock
 Easy set
gentle use
Image video quality vivid
 Radio function excellent
Then don't I give 5 star rating?Radio function need headset pluged even want listen speaker
 This least inconvient since I seldom bring headset
Background light always turns automatically don't press key several seconds
 I can't find way make constantly
This really inconvient, sometimes I can't keep pressing key since I'm reading games help look pictures
BTW, I bought TMOBILE prepaid unlock easily myself
 I found shortcut menu "voice mail box" still stick prepaid phone number
 THere's way change it
 I want listen mail box, I dial phone number, press "voice mail" menu

This phone great phone have
 It many great features, also great reception wherever I go
 I phone month now, yet done anything weired anything question it's value
 There cons this, lot
Pros:Great reception (better phones)
Videos decent quality
Pictures decent quality
Includes fm radio sounds great
The fm radio either listend headphones it's loudspeaker
The loudspeaker calls loud want be
The loudspeaker used phoned closed
The phone sleak design
The ringtone phone set loud
There basically personnal planner phone
You record messages things
Theres timer set certain time
And many features great phone
Now Cons
This phone desirable amount memory hold much
 It compatible mp3 ringtones videos stuff, come 2
5 megabites, memory phone isn't good
This phone also headset matter want radio play, even playing fm radio loudspeaker
The material phone feels kinda like cheap plastic
 I don't necessarily know durable, I mean I dropped many times far hasn't broke yet, I don't know still able resist fall concrete
 I make sure cover time case
This phone
 In oppinion, great phone I would still want almost phone
 But, kinda guy needs 3 megabites memory like drop phone constantly concrete, phone might you
 

If looking phone lots cool features one you
PROs- Great reception- Looks niceCONs- No Bluetooth- Average camera 

In past, I tried flip phones, I didn't like them, menu easy navigate, ringer wasn't loud, hifi ringers older model flip phones sound awful
 This phone easy navigate, don't even need intructions, everything self explanatory, please read instructions learn care phone
 The hifi ringers sound like listening song radio
 Reception great, loud speaker feature, clear crisp sounding
 The FM radio sound good too
 When taking photo, even daytime, don't enough light room, use night mode cammera, photo come clearer, light
 However, I reccomend, car kit accessories purchase Nokia website, authenic Nokia acessories purchased service provided
 There cheaper versions there, buyer beware, don't work well, wrong battery may actually damaged phone
 This great little phone, I'm fun it, I hope too
 I almost forgot, need buy leather case, make sure Nokia, covers entire phone, clip it, wear clothes
 Remeber smaller phone delicate want protect it
 T-mobile also Nokia case
 The Nokia website also authenticates battery going www
nokia
com/batterycheck
 Have fun
 

I LOVE THIS PHONE
 I got phone replace Nokia 3220, I couldn't stand (awful design using menu) hasn't disappointed me
 The phone isn't small, big
 The display easy read, keypad numbers nice big
 Reception usual Nokia best (for TMobile anyway)
 Speaker phone great, radio, menu + functionability really user friendly
 My complaint volumne low using phone without headset speaker phone
 If move phone around ear, hit right spot it's better, problem I've seen every Nokia phone I've 3rd 4th
 Overall, I totally pleased phone much relieved awful 3220
 

I phone I like it
Pros:Mp3 playerFM radiogood receptioncamera videocolor screensInfaredBattery LifeCons:No AM radioLimited memoryNo radio without headset 

I done research phone month purchasing it
 And I vdry glad I researched bought phone
Now, yes, I phone 2days hasn't acting yet
 It sleek look outside inside
 Very modern looking
 But soon go thru MENUS isn't story
 NOKIA kept old traditional screen-look
 Which me, 80s looking
 The colors enough make look digital enough product
 And navigation bit "weird" first dealing phone
I absolutely love FM radio feature phone
 The radio really attracted phone explains I'm entusiastic[sp?] it
 This NOKIA phone gives bit inside scoop new additional features phones going come with
 [e
g- music videos, phone themes, etc
]The camera takes decent pictures camera PHONE
Some things DO "suck" phone though, backlight doesn't stay long
 And thats tad bit annoying; I'm glad saves battery power
 I used phone past 2days haven't charge once
 YAY , NOKIA

Personalization SO much fun phone
 There many ways making phone "one-of-a-kind
"As far headset, wasn't problem cause T-MOBILE supplied box came in, even though wire bit long ugly looking
 (lol)The phone light-weight material seems durable enough
 Haven't dropped yet though
Well, notice good buy
 

I don't really need much phone, phone great


it makes calls ;)
 What I really like GREAT battery life
 I've year full battery lasts good 2-3 days
 This great simple phone
 

I wanted leave comment user said coudln't get faceplates phone you'd use tool take phone apart not, so, You get snap faceplates require tools all
 

I got phone knowing bad reviews
 Being first cell phone
 I didn't think I'd mind much
 At first great, perfect me
However, 4mb memory little


 features get annoying
It serves needs still I upgrade
 Now starts freeze


I like size, menus (they aren't THAT bad navigate) displays nice customize
 It isn't terrible phone, great
ALL PHONES quirks people range much reviews


 phone die even best always rotten apples bunch
 This phone good first cell phone I didn't need features memory I would like now


So I won't knock stars I outgrew it, it's issues annoyances
 Definitely phone advanced users people like features, FM radio cool idea I used use it


 since getting MP3 player really haven't touched feature
 

I HAVE HAD THIS CELL PHONE FOR ABOUT A MONTH
 I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT YET AND DONT HOPE TO
 THIS IS MY SECOND CELLPHONE, AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN MY SONY ERICSON T637
 I DID NOT GET THIS PHONE ON AMAZON, I WOULD NOT PAY SOO MUCH ON THIS SITE FOR THIS PHONE
 I GOT MY 6101 FOR FREE FROM WALMART, YES WALMART YOU'D THINK THEY DONT HAVE GOOD PHONES BUT THEY DO
PROSGREAT RECEPTION ( TMOBILE IS GREAT)LOUD SPEAKERPHONEVOICE RECORED (WHICH YOU CAN USE AS A RINGTONE)VIDEO RECORDERPREETY GOOD CAMERA ( BETTER THAN MY SONY ERICSON)LOUD RINGTONESLARGE SCREENSLARGE KEYPADEASY NAVIGATION, EASY TO USECONSLIGHT TURNS OFF AFTER LIKE 15 SEC AND THERES NO WAY TO CHANGE IT, ANNOYING AT TIMES
DOESNT FEEL THAT DURABLE, BUT DOESNT FEEL FRAGIL SO I GOT A CASE FOR MINE JUST IN CASE
YOU HAVE TO PRESS LIKE 6 KEYS BEFORE YOU GET TO THE SILENT BUTTONTHE INTERNAL SCREEN DOES NOT RESET ITSELF AFTER YOU CLOSE THE PHONE, THE SCREEN IS THE SAME AFTER YOU OPEN IT LIKE 2 HOURS LATER WHICH IS VERY VERY ANNOYINGALL IN ALL THIS IS A GREAT BEGINNER PHONE (FOR THE PRICE I GOT IT FOR
) 

I purchased phone one month back
 I Nokia Phone fan
 I last three Nokia phone
 This First Flip phone I excited find Nokia came Flip Phone
 My Excitement died one month I used extensively
 This phone disappointed earlier Nokia 3650 3660
 If I choice I would like trade phone Nokia 3660
 Here reason1) This phone says plays mp3 what's point enough storage
 This phone comes 4mb RAM 2
0 MB already used default left 2 MB
2) Searching contact phone book slow
 You might wonder going affect believe driving matters lot
 After press phone book want search name S come keep pressing PQRS
 Also show name starting last name first name (S) shows start S
 So want search John Watt press W list John Watt press J problem 3660
3) Now even get name like John Watt contact pressing J press talk automatically dials default number
 If name multiple numbers like Office, Home, Cell get option choose number dial I love 3660 3650
 You select view select number
4) I purchased phone I hear FM radio office
 Reception phone poor lot noise point FM radio
5) No blue Tooth I use blue Tooth Head phone
Here plus phoneLarge screen, good phone reception that's it
From feature phone claim useless either due lack storage poor radio performance
This time Nokia disappointed Nokia needs improve lot flip phone
 Hope Nokia come better phone flip version
 

This first flip-phone Nokia ever produced
 Good job first effort, owning couple flip-phones; two Motorolas, LG, one leaves something desired
 Okay, me, seems Nokia didn't research Motorola LG designing one own
 If had, phone would lot user-friendly
 As is, phone offer ringtone assignment individuals (you create group), banner, quick voice calling, ability keep lights (displays keys lit up)
 What lacks, makes areas
 Such as, external camera activation control (flip closed), FM Radio (though additional enhancement operate must purchased seperately won't work), excellent battery life, talk time signal reception
 Having owned LGVX6000, I'd highly recommend 6101, though can't use T-Mobile
 This good phone I enjoy using it, though I miss ease convenience LG
 I recommend phone first flip-phone anyone looking switch traditional "candy bar" style Nokia known for
 















I'm peruavian, bought phone Peru movistar service


PROS:It looks nice solid
 I scared scratching screen (I've always done past phones) one incredible solid
 phone also felt once, course intention, continue working normal
It cool features, personalize locate quick options menu, get simple navigation
 Finally say battery great


i use 4 days regular use continues working
CONS:The internal memory poor
No USB cable included
Pictures low resolution(but normal cell phones kind)This phone still BIG heavy considering models
For price, durability apparel one good choice
I've never made friends nokia past, regret, beacuse good choice need hard-everyday-use phone


simple firm
 

I've phone year now, good phone, year use, pretty shot
 It operates fine, physical looks features wear fast
 The rubber side pieces nice little thing started yellow fell off
 It doesn't support mp3 ringtones
 However, I never problem service great phone texting talking
 Battery life pretty good also
 I absolutely love user-friendly menus screen features
 Nokia done great job creating one best phone operating systems there
 

First disclaimer
 I unabashed biased Nokia phone user
 They better reception, better user interface, better reliability, free PC Suite Nokia PC connection software(read OUTLOOK/SYNC CONTACTS BACKUP)
This phone thoughtful alarm sequence missed call/msg/alarm alert
 It begins vibrate, moves vibrate+low ring, vibrate+increasing louder ring, finishes occasional side light blinks never answer
 Very pleasant non-irritating reminder
The Contact Note length increased previous Nokia Series 40 phones 4 times
 This nice use phone add extra info notes contacts, nice business feature
 The PDA features expanded TODO lists, Weekly calendar/appts view, Notes list, Meeting/Memo alarm types
The GOTO list expanded customizable quick access used phone functions
 Contacts, Msg, Calendar, Camera functions access fixed navigation keys
 Nice
 The camera good email 4X6 shots adequate light only
 Typical business phones
Some reviews inet mention phone designed attract younger crowd side lights customizable 'electric' face plate option
 Well, may be, rest us practical users, without option face plate, small thin small business phone side lights blink msg/call arriving blink intermittently forever look missed msg/call/alarms
 NICE
I won't mention features covered others reviews specs, let say excellent phone anyone young small business person less experienced user
 It covers bases needed, small, practical, feature laden platform
Did I mention three ways backup precious value contact/notes data base, tediously built valuable time; SIM CARD board stores/backs-up 256 contact numbers, SyncML Client upload full phone memory free online backup/recover sites, thirdly, Nokia's free PC Suite Windows software makes phone appear another external storage device 'Explore'
You like heart set MP3 player HiQ Camera combination device
 More go wrong better separate opinion
I pleased T-Mobiles service S CA
 You use phone contract GO PHONE 8
5 cents per minutes buy T-Mobile SIM card 1000 minute card low $85
 If chatter lot, free nights/weekends/faves minutes contract phone makes sense
 Hope helps
 :) 

phone features need, evaluate basic functions fine
 weren't bad service i'm getting T-Mobile wouldn't even dream getting rid it
 I've year never trouble it
 I used camera beginning novelty don't use much anymore, works fine
 

I loved phone I got it
 It lasted year I problem untill son threw glass juice
 If water proof, would perfect
 I've selection oh phones since one didnt compare, I'm waiting new nokia 3220
 The menu isnt bad one person said, short cut menus
 Also adjust call volume talking, push button left right
 I loved phone I cant wait new one
 

I've phone two years I love still

 It come two different covers, stencil put background picture
 It also given great reception matter I been
 The battery lasted longest
 I even bought phones still switched back one
 It's durable completely satisfies needs
 

I phone year now
 I almost always recieve good reception thorough phone
 I recently changed cover phone comes two, nice feature
My complaints regular phone ring tone
 They songs T-moblile ringtone
 The thing select button kind odd difficult use pushing it
 Sometimes goes right camera features menu
This phone held pretty good me
 I hard though
 

looking cell phone robust, great reception, extremely simple use long battery hours, one
 however bluetooth, IR, buy cable connects pc seperatly
the camera high resolution, good enough cellphone wallpapers
 nice feature side lights keep flashing receive message voicemail
 cover keypad easily changed
 

I phone since 2005
 Never needed buy new battery
Pros1/ camera, voice recorder, good alarm clock, calendar
2/ survived water damage 2008
 1st day inoperational
 By 3rd day, dry, worked like new 
 Working well 3 weeks counting
3/ calls loud clear, recepient, given phone's got 2 bars more
 T-mobile service
Cons1/ resolution photos 0
3 megapixel, I believe
2/ it's basic, basic phone
interesting factoid
 This phone old enough outdated enough seen 2008, CNN India, villager storing video footage Indian girl, villagers recognized structural similarity known Indian deity
 

I got phone gift BF



 He really loved I really loved it


 I put pictrure us together back


 Another nice things lightswhen somebody calling you're talking somebody



 So far it's 2 months already complains yet him


 me




 NOKIA really best phone there







 

This good deal price
 The keys take little getting used since square button 2 numbers rock either choose
 The earphone volume quite loud enough (on max), I may little hard hearing
 The display typical I wish text larger many cases, maybe eyes aren't great either
 The ringer outstanding; can't miss hearing it
 The battery life really great
 Some features bit cryptic somewhat hard find, work well
 So it's solid 3-star phone 4 5 star bits thrown in
 

I fell purchasing phone less accident
 I've two years taken beating still works great
 Every OS needs reboot, rare
 The sound quality good, times I wish louder, even manual volume adjustment
 I also use basic scheduling reminders
 This I find originally unexpected lights side phone useful
 In darkened room phone silent, lights flash brightly alarms, calls, txts, voice-mails
The reasons I'm dropping phone I'm moving area poor T-Mobile coverage (not phone's fault) I require better email texting features
 

If u tend drop ur phone lot
 This phone break
 It made fall apart easily put together
 It should
 light rubber covers tear apart ok nothin special
 

This first phone
 And first, I loved it
 I thought coolest thing
 It could light up, take pictures, make sound recordings
 This great first phone
However, I've definately outgrown it, due certain circumstances life, I'm stuck it
 Now phone seems clunky compared cool sleek phones there, image quality nothing amazing, hold polyphonic ringtones
Bottom line: I would recommend phone parents buying kids first phone
 However, means good phone experienced cell phone user
** Also, get deal Cingular T-Mobile get phone $20
 By means pay price store online $100
 Not worth it
 

I bought phone cheap lights looked cute
However, upon testing out, first thing made cringe interface
 My service T-Mobile, according manual, carrier option altering menu interface
 I suspect case, interface match one manual
 Anyhow, submenus
 Rather, everything phone directory text messages, adjusting ringtone, using email, listed HUGE list
 This means something simple send text message, must scroll list 100 items get text message inbox
Also, volume earpiece extremely quiet
 In empty room home, noise coming outside, I could hear person talk unless I shoved end phone ear, even barely audible
 With previous cell phone, I could hear person talk even I held phone inch away head
 There buttons speak side phone (e
g
 volume control), I didn't see call-volume controls menu
The blinking colored lights sides bright fantastic, otherwise phone lacking every way possible
 

My Nokia 3220 phone huge letdown functionality
 First, I bought camera
 The camera allow send pictures
 Or settings, came phone sufficient
 This one best reasons camera phone
 The 2nd unique feature I excited FM radio function
 My phone capability either
 Even sending one back receiving brand new phone (exact model first), FM function
 Now I don't options contact Nokia direct, I don't think I brand new phone
 So I impressed model recommend it
 I huge Nokia fan phone
 

I like phone lot
 I couldn't find around anywhere
 

This cell phone coolest things could ever had
 I like text alot cell phone right one job
 I think anyone likes fun enjoy texting like phone

 




I like Crystal clear Cases last long buy several relace every two month fine
 My problem I ordered three paid three got one mail I guess big ripoff
 Do buy th coompany
 

This case nice looks great new
 Only problem use pants pocket like I do, might scratch really quick
 Also, material resistant, $5 something anyone could afford
 You may consider buy 2 3 instead 1, case need replacement 

Product great looking protect screen scratches
 On side case cracks breaks time
 Mine started cracking & breaking within weeks
 

The 6170 attractive phone; sturdy large enough hold, keys good size too
 The speaker sound great callers say I sound clear too
The positives: calls clear, signal strength great (usually works fine one bar), synchronization software included (some phone mfgs make buy software), camera good
 Aesthetically attractive, easy use
A negatives: shape phone may uncomfortable ear talk long time (it ergonomically rounded, square), accessories easy find (does use 2
5 headset jack), voice record button side may get pushed accidentally record minutes day - take limited phone memory
 Except silencing meeting reminders set synchronizing outlook, meeting alarm annoying can't changed
 No bluetooth
Overall, I find phone good functional telephone; negatives, annoying times, detract satisfaction phone
 

Bought christmas satisfied
 Beautiful big display plus another one outside


pops open keys lit gorgeous blue making easy use night
 The phone friendly nokia interface


maybe it's thick Razr's friends have, least I text message them


they can't figure write back
 Function form
 I hope though future nokia figures make clamshell models thin fit pocket
 

I LOVE THIS PHONE
 I got phone service provider replace 6800, I want another one
 I switching service providers, wish I could get new 6170 them, I found phone discontinued
 I seriously considering buying Amazon $239
 It great color displays, wonderful sound quality, I especially love voice record feature, I simply press button phone conversation (like I'm driving need write # someone giving me), record number, listen recording write # later
 It reduces amount time I spend pulling road things, searching frantically pen paper
 I wish Nokia still offering phone consumers
 I LOVE IT
 

It doesn't come push talk application


 it's supposed push talk capable without application


 can't use it


 took away push talk application?? :( 



I'm reviewing unlocked/unbranded version phone (not customized particular carrier)
First ask "is phone me?" It's complex phone advanced features beyond making receiving calls don't like reading manuals probably stay away
 If unable program VCR probably stay away
 If don't need synch contacts calendar PC, phone size probably overkill
I upgraded Motorola RAZR utility handset superior one almost every way except size
 Much like higher-end Nokia reception sound/voice quality excellent
 The Symbian s60 operating system allows install number applications suit needs including advanced email applications, GPS navigation, web browsers, games etc
 The menus responsive switching running applications quite easy
 Nokia also provides Nokia PC Suite software easily synching contacts calendar entries either provided USB cable bluetooth connection computer support it
 I've done first two days I've phone
 Additionally Nokia's contact system far superior Motorola, collapsing information individual single phone-book entry
 On Motorla every phone number, email address bits information separate phone book entries make quite mess
 Another great feature Nokia offers phone (as many phones) ability LOCK UNLOCK keyboard two simple keypresses
 This quite useful tend throw phone book bag pocket might accidentally call someone
 If lazy take simple precaution PLEASE DON'T BLAME THE PHONE
 The camera takes adequate pictures good lighting CELL PHONE
 These images blow hang wall simply images successfully capture moment, whatever happens be
 It replace competent digital camera, phones horizon offer better images
 With increased size DV RS-MMC available memory photos, applications, music files (at time) increased 1GB - I won't carry flash MP3 player much longer
What phone well I give 4
5/5 compared options available today work U
S
 GSM carriers' bands (850/1900)
 I didn't give phone 5 stars due to:- buttons close together, particularly 2 navigational button - I'll get used this
- on-board RAM bit small result memory errors using Opera's browser
- camera lens slide cover feels bit flimsy require caution keep breaking
- picture quality could always improved
 

I got unlocked phone 2 weeks ago, I LOVE it
 To honest, I don't like use bluetooth headset calling really weird like I'm talking nobody street
 So, I don't problem related bluetooth link
I say, best Nokia I've ever battery cover really tight
 No kidding, I hate Nokias I mostly slack back cover
 I really HATE it
 But one GOOD
Frankly, I looking forward N80 shaped flagship Nokia year
 But, keeps unpublished, I got one
 four hundred buck price seems little overpriced partly updated version 6630
 BUT, really well craft phone
The camera slide cover one wanted design camera phones, models got it
 It best way protect, works fantastic phone
However, keyboard set pain ass
 The arrange tight I barely hold 400 buck baby tight enough I'm typing
 It loooks good though
The battery life problem imporved, definitely good enough
 But, better N71, much better Samsung
I hate say I guess Nokia mean customers
 Several pre-installed softwares games need registered (Paid) purchasing
 I'm saying I shouldn't pay I got, I consider Nokia charge those
The menu set also problem used functions hidden inside folders rather main menu, like call history, even though moved there
 But, i'm uncomfortable that
last least, PC Suite still stupid occupies lot space ram works like giant useless idiot
Finally, fantastic phone
 The problem is, it's bit pricy all
 Great design, great produce, great sound, great video playback
 

I old Nokia 3650 whos reception poor, I switched Motorola v330
 The Motorola price primitive crude compaired 3650 I got Nokia 6600, really great phone
 But I saw 6681 came out, saw improvement screen specs camera knew I one
I got used Nokia 60 series software problem using it
 I never got hang Motorola software
I read every review I could get hands read owners saying I bought unlocked one using T-Mobile service
 The reason I bought 6681 6682 I like pearl white color better silver
 I've taken mine Cingular compare 6682 silver color doesn't cut it
 Nokia stuck pearl white
I've got tell one fantastic phone
 If side, I don't know is
 Nokia taken 60 series software gotten perfect
 They improved software many new features I couldn't tell all, fixed almost every complaint I 3650 6600 (they basically software features)
 The 6681 huge leap forward
The screen amazing, it's fast, signal strength best I've ever had, sound like wired set, customize buttons new Standby icons call feature phone has
 I amazed good new ring tones sound, it's like stereo
I full PDA phone 6681 constantly using address book, calendar calculator
 It's easy call using Standby icons
 I don't text message, I complaints keypad
The camera okay (it's PHONE), it's got flash remarkably improved indoor shots
 I use bluetooth day works like charm me
 I problem battery life, I use 6681 lot go couple days charges
It syncs beautifully Apple's iSync downloading pictures snap bluetooth
Not Windows PC I haven't able try music features things do
 Shame Nokia Mac software yet
 I don't even know anyone owns Windows PC, I don't know I'll ever able use features
 There Windows machines office I couldn't get recognize Phone, I gave up
I can't tell much I like phone
 It's heads shoulders phone I've seen better PDA phones people office
 I don't know Nokia going improve one, I know I won't switching phones long time
 

I recently returned T-mobile MDA SDA
 The interface intuitive
 Had RAZR intermittent reception home
 I also Moto V551 stopped receiving signals 1 month use
 My trusty Moto V300 still worked best reception phones I mentioned 2 years
 Still situations I hear conversation breaking apartment (my coverage T-mo considered "fair" based T-mo's coverage map home)
The 6682 unlocked version selling $400 CompUSA Nokia's web site
 At first I thought way expensive wanted buy try past experiences proving huge cost tons features packed little device mean "jack trades, master none"
The surprising aspect 6682 reception
 I've given devices embedded antennas almost certainly intermittent reception
 The 6682 always held signal "fair" coverage apartment
 My conversation sounded clear breakup
User interface device excellent compared MDA SDA
 The SDA horrible joystick using MDA half time still required stylus complete tasks
 Although I get sore thumb using 6682 much navigating interface
 Wish Nokia made direction pad rubberized padded, small issue
Everything including web features works box
 I didn't pull hair like using MDA SDA
 The 6682 came preconfigured proxy settings T-zones start browsing web immediately long T-mobileWeb subscription
I admit still learning curve interface different Motos I had
 So I crack open manual I never got frustrated like I MDA SDA
To sum up, reception EXCELLENT
 Interface EXCELLENT
 And everything actually works
 Now I look $400 see phone worth price
 

This first PDA phone, first PDA
 I didn't want two devices anymore, one
 And I psyched finally phone would sync computer
 So I purchased Nokia 6682 Cingular service
 In past I owned LG picture phones Verizon celluar service new adventure me
 I means afraid technology
 I love it
 But phone bit learning curve me
 I opted keep old phone extra month I wouldn't missing calls trying figure new phone
 I decided get bluetooth, Plantronics Discovery 550 sounds great phone
 The signal reception EXCELLENT
 The phone place attach lanyard I hang phone near window apartment I get 6 bars use bluetooth
 My apt
 building gets lousy reception huge relief
 Another handy dandy thing I've found I hang phone landyard rearview mirror, I quickly look need be
 It also never gets tossed car; swings back forth
 One thing I didn't realize I bought phone need Microsoft Outlook (part Microsoft Office) use phonebook calendar
 Luckily I program else I would screwed
 After downloading info phone I started getting "low memory" warnings
 So bit investigating, I discovered phone 8MB internal memory used trial applications
 So I deleted (with tech support) I memory available
 I would suggest buying larger memory card; comes 64MB
 I thrilled pictures either takes lousy video
 My old LG much better camera
 But I digital camera reasons
 The MP3 player theory nice headphone jack phone proprietary I use headphones unless I pick adapter
 Make sure lock keypad aren't using phone
 As people said volume isn't great bluetooth didn't matter
 You alot customize phone I like
 The battery life okay, great
 Overall, I psyched phone appointments contacts gets great reception
 The Nokia 6682 could better I satisfied, [


] 

Purchased Sept 05 utilize new cars bluetooth capabilities
 Works great car well wifes
 I recommend using "Active Standby" mode simplify navigating phones many features
 It allows user assign 5 shortcuts icons assign two right left soft keys
 Additionally, calendar "To Do" notes shown become 2 direct shortcuts apps
 These 9 shortcuts shown main "Standby" screen also displays current track name (a 10th shortcut) playing audio
 Pressing "end" button always return "Standby" screen
 All contacts nearly applications may given voice tags eliminate keystrokes 
 I purchase optional voice recognition software use voice tags instead
 The camera activated slide open neat cover even locked keypad
 I upgraded 512M card gives enough room couple CD's worth music still space pictures
 Images actually pretty good lighting right
 One review stated call log difficult access


not true
 Depressing "send" button momentarily bring scoll left/right see missed, dialed received logs
 Also holding blue "Menu" button show apps currently running allow user quickly select one display
 The "C" (clear) button also acts delete reduce scrolling pop menus
 Another shortcut use * (star) key viewing calendar toggle month, week day views
 The keypad used often things like rotate zoom images directly select folders
The Office Adobe software great viewing certain files
 I done real editing docs I won't comment that
 I done image editing included software found fun easy use I quite bit work much learning curve me
 Those capabilities somewhat limited I impressed phone
 It may appear so, rugged


I dropped onto concrete least 5 6 times still shows little wear always functioned reliably
 The screen scratches all
 Emailing feature great works fast Cingular network
 Speaker works well calls
 Sounds like old transister radio 60's music works
 Placing speaker object cut treble improve sound headphones better
 Many complained keypad small
 I find close spacing smooth flat tops angled side efficient easy use
 I use thumb close spacing means little travel I enter text numbers quickly I writing book
 To obtain number instead letter text mode, simply hold key instead tapping 4 times
 The Symbian OS allow users add additional software enhance customize functionality making much phone
 Battery life pretty good depends amount use
 There audible indicator sounds alert low seldom issue
 I car charger well USB charger PC
 The round navigation button requires care wanting press center position
 It easy miss inadvertantly get position instead
 I wish dedicated button phone music could accessed I would remove belt
 I also wish used standard connectors plug headphone PC somewhat pain use
 Cingular software issues phone first released last year withdrew while
 They fixed bugs enhancments well since worked great me
 There may newer phones coming may enhanced features 6682 lacks proven tough reliable performer difficult replace
 

I've phone year so, I'm pretty happy it's functionality, always problems crashing, spontaneously rebooting, spontaneously turning off, worsened gradually time
 The camera takes OK pictures really good light, degrades quickly less-than-ideal lighting conditions


 ergonomics camera use weird, IMHO
 The battery life hasn't held well time either
I've decided upgrade Sony-Ericsson K550i Cyber-Shot
 It's smaller, lighter, better battery life known reliability
 The camera resolution better, camera ergonomics better, it's MP3 player too
 Worth extra $50, book, least needs
 This phone isn't bad - it's served well, make good backup, I wouldn't pay pocket unlocked replacement
 

I've phone well year now, great, perfect
 This thing needs RAM: Like s60 phones, "out memory" issues appear
 However, little control, issues negated
 Opera, example, cause phone run memory while, however, Opera mini functionality big brother, used extended browsing
 Multitasking great, however powerful apps require undivided attention phone cause apps close
 The camera pretty good, long don't zoom, video better expected
 I bought audio adapter plug Bronco's headunit, 2GB card full songs
 When I go offroading, thing tucked away center console, placed random
 The sound quality great
 The headphones included decent, I never really like earbuds
 The best part owning phone great programs available, free
 If thing 5x RAM does, newest version Symbian, would probably dream phone
 

I've phone 1
5 years, absolutely loved every minute using it
 As others said, getting full use takes little bit manual-reading, that's expected device much
 And don't spend hours working it, little time
Pros: Nokia sound call quality, amazing array uses, ability customize uses, rock-solid construction (I've dropped mine many times, it's still going strong), large screen, ability take picture seconds flicking lens cover backCons: Size
 It's brick, it's flyweight, either
 But I'll gladly carry extra ounces order get use qualityI recently renewed cell contract got brand-new, highly rated flip phone, I've never used it
 I keep desk case I ever break 6682
 

The Nokia 6682 almost hits mark
 Feature-wise, it's got lot going it
 Usability-wise, interface isn't intuitive fast be
 The obvious example address book search requires 3 key letter input instead smart intelligent filter requires one press per character
 Other times it's many button presses required
 Pressing circle pad always select default action often brings menu choices
 There menu/select button purpose
 I like multi-tasking aspect symbian os
 It's cool I audio file playing I another task
 But seems phone tight ram run two programs choose randomly close background apps
 Again it's good phone, quite right me, computer geek
 I'll probably try pass girlfriend get something evolved ready new(er) phone
 

This second Nokia 6682
 I bought original one phone came 2006
 A couple keys recently stopped working, I went find new phone
 I didn't see anything market features, quality good design 6682, I bought new one old stock
 I love it
Nokia best user interfaces market
 You re-arrange menu liking, put whatever function want soft keys
 Simply best
 

I phone two years cosmetic finish started wear, phone works perfectly
 It learning curve many capabilities, Nokia user, get comfortable relatively quickly
 I trouble buttons T9 predictive text system makes text input easy, maybe easier, using full keyboard
Besides phone, I use text messaging, web surfing, sending email, taking pictures
 I initially got work Word Excel files, screen small
 In pinch it's OK, don't expect much viewing files
 I also used Bluetooth headsets paired easily work fine
 I used phone Europe voice, texting, data problems
Battery life remained consistent 4-5 hours use
 I make sure Bluetooth data connection turned I'm using them
 This extends battery life even more
I phone 2 years I currently looking upgrade bigger screen, Wi-Fi, 3G capabilities
 I count one hand number times phone crashed locked up
 Well, maybe one hand, infrequently enough I can't remember last time
If, when, I trade up, I discard 6682
 It trusted backup works
 

I phone couple months I happy say buy worth money know use features
The 1
3 mpxl camera good night mode sucks 
 The xpress print software something new among phones good instant photos 
 It gps enabled also amazing
 The mp3 player nothing much rave - good people happy 10 songs phone
 The features overall hi - tech pleasing customer Be Warned - This Phone heavy big-OVERALL A GOOD BUY FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE BEING HIP IN PHONES AND LIKE A LUMP HANGING IN THEIR POCKET
 

There's much little fellah can't do, outside gently waking day gentle music nice hot cup coffee, even nearly - wake supply music, coffee
However, I'm fairly no-nonsense business user
 I couldn't give hoot ring tones, MP3 functionality, video calls, Microsoft Office suite board - I need phone reliable, easy use, sturdy
 Admittedly, camera nice extra
 The rest is, mind, youthful dalliance
 You might ask I opted phone
 In truth, I ask question fairly regularly, too
Nokia given phone new user interface - I suppose intended improvement traditional Nokia one, remarkably counter-intuitive, cases doesn't work
* For life me, I can't find way bulk deleting text messages phone itself, deleting one-by-one seems require least three keystrokes per message
 Now it's true one could use PC interface but, frankly, I never bothered sync PC, isn't hassle-free option
*** POST SCRIPT : There IS way bulk deleting texts phone (thanks wrote point out) - need "mark all" "delete" (a bit like hotmail account)
 In fairness means obvious let alone intuitive, sort alpha-male never reads instruction manual, I never would found collective power Amazon community
 **** The configuration buttons means easy accidentally call someone phone knocking around bag
 This happens week, it's usually embarrassing - like I'm singing along iPod something
 Yes, I know, I lock keypad, time I do, it's fact life I don't always
 I never problem previous Nokia phones (I've owned seven different models)
* The camera high resolution, isn't high enough
 It seems either go whole hog genuine 3 megapixel+ digital camera, may well blurry old images trusty old 6230 which, I say, remains favourite Nokia phone
* This critical one - phone's reception isn't great
 I frequently find I unable make calls around home, suburban London
 I never trouble 6230
 Given I haven't switched networks, I attribute phone
* Also, it's plasticky - I've maybe three months now, I don't fancy chances surviving another nine contract up
 I'm tough phone
I guess we're stuck age heavy-use, content-added superconsumer drives mobile phone design, superconsumers brainless teenagers, me, perfect mobile phone design would one accentuated sturdiness sound quality: give 6230-shaped model decent camera, hard-tail aluminium construction decently-specified audio componentry would last ten years, I might never buy phone again
Chances happening, age disposable consumerism? Zero
Olly Buxton 

I purchased phone replace Nokia 6230, I back using
 I great success every Nokia product I owned, one
Problems:1
 The phone shut randomly calls
2
 The battery life less 3 days standby
3
 The bluetooth would disconnect every call
 This problem headset, I integrated bluetooth system vehicle
 The vehicle requires car stopped
 The phone would allow found (even though discovery mode) unless I turned car off
 I problem Nokia 6230
4
 The "Suite" syncing caused conflicts decreased operating speed computer necessitated removal
I now, first time long time, considering purchasing another brand
 

soo nice u buy`t pPl really nice 
 















I've 6820 back days AT&T; Wireless absolutely loved it: QWERTY keyboard exceptionally easy use, Bluetooth, GSM/works europe, great battery life, it's compact secure
I mention "secure" sense settings stay lock them
 I've many phones change ring volume settings, turn off, unlock even call people phone front pocket
 This phone small enough carry pocket (instead lame hip-holsters)and pants don't end calling friends colleagues
After time, 6820 inevitably broke, market
 Oddly, ringer broke--the flip mechanism quite robust
But I stuck without phone
 I sure didn't want dingleberry, Treo
 I would always joke folks holding notebook ear saying "Hello?" I want phone, small laptop read 
xls files
 But choices slim
I really wanted QWERTY using SMS really convenient I can't stand using T9
 And I needed bluetooth car, GSM europe
My choice try new Samsung SGH-D307 flip keyboard
 I shocked poor is
 The menu system dis-integrated one review puts "you actively ignore buttons say, use buttons indicate things DON'T want do
" Talk cognitive dissonance
 Oh, QWERTY doesn't work anything SMS
 So can't even use entering addresses
 QWERTY supposed let avoid T9 predictive text, Samsung ill-developed, QWERTY works SMS IM
 Uugh
There literally decent solution market 6822 released
 The downside origial 6820 mediocre camera screen resolution, addressed 6822
Just don't order nokiausa--it's customer service infuriatingly poorly run you'll pop blood vessels
 My order in-stock product languished 10 days
 Yes, I even upgraded FedEx next-day, nokia problem order "not yet processed" state
 Hmmm? So I call several times find delay would say order authorized "the address information wrong
" I'm pretty sure I know address, order number, I could see I made typo
So I called AMEX (of course) confirmed billing address, moreover said hadn't declined card due AVS mismatch
 Hmmm
 Did nokia even try process order? I doubt it
 I even nokiausa supervisor hang I asked name reference
So many calls several hours time, I couldn't get root problem
 Customer service couldn't help problem allegedly billing, yet wouldn't allow talk billing
 "That's option
" supervisors would tell me
 They would assure billing department would call me, never happened
 I could never find billing saying AMEX
 But again, according AMEX, never declined card either nokiausa billing department lying AVS problem order, broken submitting someone else's information
 In case, try I might, 'problem' couldn't identified, much less solved, I choice give up
 What huge waste time
Bottom line: 6822 fabulously small QWERTY, bluetooth, multimedia camera, GSM phone extraneous features extra size
 I heartily recommend buying it
 The Finns know build great phone
 They're successful running US order customer service center count on
 

I bought first Nokia 6822 back 2004, droped bathm tub cleaning :(The Cingular Store carrying phone I went get new one, I settled $25 Nokia new 6822 came out
 As turned out, phone available Cingular carry it, Best Buy

 I found amazon
I love phone
 It allows type easier bottom line
 Nokia also makes great phone sounds good user friendly
 I always buy Nokia - make great quality phones
 

I, like many reviewers, upgraded Nokia 6800 phone
 With said, phone great taking quick notes, grocery lists, synchronizing calendar reminders MS Outlook, etc
 The reception Nokia phones excellent too
 Nokias tend interfere electronic devices (stereos, radios, etc) I assume that's due stronger signal output
I would given phone 5 stars cheap feeling plastic case
 The Nokia 6800 much larger heavier 6822 solid plastic case
 

I true nokia longest time reasons that






 1
 user friendly phone book, (I dont 3 entries person cell, home work phone
) 2
 Great prices phones
 3
 Great features phones (especially bluetooth IR port)
 I started 6800 thought flip open keyboard awesome, upgrated nokia 6820
 When 6822 came out, I psyched unfortunately carrier phone cincinnati bell
 Soo, I made mistake buying phone via ebay
 I paid 250
00 used unlocked phone came UK
 The features awesome, better camera phone, faster internet, screensaver phone
 The problem kept dropping calls left right I problem IR port
 I thought carrier (cingular)
 I stopped Nokia store Chicago found phone $189
00
 They limited supply tell can't keep phone stock
 They phone works great now, I rarely drop calls
 I Love phone wouldn't recommend phone


 If buy phone make sure US sponsored phone not, able use AIM ICQ phone
 Also way better reception phone

 Good Luck ENJOY


 

If looking phone, odds really want QWERTY keyboard
It works like charm
 The flip style keyboard looks flimsy, not
 It robust flip phone I ever seen used
 This phone everything txter needs
However, loose lot features phone could other
 It has, hands down, worst screen camera I ever used
 I happen care things
 I opinion phone serve one purpose, make calls
 The reception depends carrier, I'm going touch that
One great piece design 5 way navigation button
 This reduces need 5 buttons puts single, elegantly placed, joystick
 This is, next keyboard, favorite feature phone
 Along rest buttons, intuitive
 It also Bluetooth
 Some people might care, might find handy
 I happen find handy
 I purchased PALM TX use phone, like smart phone minus suckage, connected great
 You turn Bluetooth on, mess PALM little, in
 In short, rocks
As battery life, also PWNS
 My last phone, Kyocera KX2, didn't battery
 You unplug door, get error message tells buy better phone
 The 6820 must soft solar cell technology
 I never plug wall
 I call power free phone will
 Granted I glued phone, You still get amazing battery life thing
Basically phone purely want type quickly
 If looking for, like myself, get phone
 If want anything else it, not
 I gave rating 5 primary purpose, keyboard, I happen like, lot
 

solid structure solid software system
 bluetooth capabilities wounderful
 leave bluetooth time pair devices easily quickly
 sometimes compatibility issues riends phones usually happens becuase they're razr sucks bluetooth
 fold keyboard amazing, light button light dark
 use bunch different istandt messagaing services including AIM
 also GREAT calendar software sync microsoft outlook ever else computer
 also software nokia provides computer really great
 first phone came software kinda sucky buggy since worked really hard make computer software work become usefull
 download programs nokia website port phone too
 digital camera super high quality works well pinch good size sending multimedia messages such
 one side video format takes runs nokia software (as far know)
 maybe file convertered there
 doesnt real big screen polyphics utility wise think best phone ever
 promised self would keep getting long can
 

Honestly, I use iPhone nowadays
 However, I almighty iPhone, Nokia 6822 lord sovereign
 I fondly recall flipping keypad open send world's quickest text getting audible gasps stares
 This phone sleek, useful, still cell phone
 The Unlocked version served well voyages Spain Turkey, assimilated easily (though price)to consequent stops throughout Europe
 I wish I still used phone I truly miss able text quicker I could form words
 

I've holding Nokia 6800 phone (1) I loved (2) AT&T; Wireless plan much cheaper available Cingular
 BUT, I started using minutes overages killing me, I upgrade
 Thinking I NEEDED foldout keyboard, I got freebie Nokia Cingular bought 6822 Amazon swapped SIM cards
I disappointed
The phone much smaller 6800, first I thought good, also scaled screen tiny
 I could barely fit internet content screen worked well 6800
I disappointed couldn't custom ring contact, could assign contacts 5 different groups custom ring whole group
 (This shortcoming 6800
)For 6800 users: On flip-out keyboard, cut spacebars half size 6800 put green red buttons (call & cancel, etc
) place lost half
 I found accidently hitting red button losing typing
There ability run Yahoo's Messenger Mail program Java like many newer phones (instead browser)
There ability streaming video
This might user problem, I couldn't find way display time "home screen," important me
I found reception lacking, also
In summary, I returned phone Amazon swapped freebie Nokia Cingular store RAZR
 If need upgrade 6800 care phone calls, either try new E70 check Motorola's phones
 

Where I begin? If age five, hard time using keyboard
 The phone overall, tiny
 It's primarily made cheap, hollow plastic
 I would look person purchasing 



I phone year now
 As others written, occasionally lock up, little slow times
However, I amazed still nothing rivals terms screen keyboard size
 I don't even bother included email application, web browser good enough checking gmail account
 (note gmail app, works normal gmail accounts "Google Apps Domain" accounts)There lot phones keyboards now, none well designed
 And I don't think phones many features don't require occasional reboot
Bottom line: screen adequate web browsing, keyboard good enough write long emails, package looks like ordinary phone open up, fits nicely pocket


 alternative
I would upgrade upgrade, I happy it
 

I previously owned T-Mobile Dash HTC, worked well I liked it
 After crunching one accident, I decided get unlocked phone seemed bit beefy
 I don't like Blackberries, I decided try Nokia 9300
 It discontinued couple years, I still managed find brand new box North American version strongly discounted price
 I old Nokia bar phone years back, thing still works today, reliability great Nokia's based experience
The 9300 honestly best phone I ever owned
 I five months now, Symbian 7
0 series 80 OS never crashed, even once, entire time I owned it; Dash's Windows Mobile 6
0 OS used crash every week, least week
 The Dash could take call working spreadsheet without freezing, 9300 seems manage fine
 The spacious 80 MB internal memory also seems stand Nokia good stead
My Dash 1
3 Mpixel camera video, Nokia camera
 This may seem like drawback, I honestly don't care; I never cared cameras phones begin with
 The Dash full QWERTY keyboard crammed onto lower front, 9300 gigantic inner keyboard akin miniature laptop
 I love keyboard 9300, I doubt phone one, except possibly 9500


My T-Mobile service decent, customer service outstanding, I hardly ever drop calls
 When I Cingular/AT&T; back day, coverage wider I dropped many calls I couldn't really carry long conversation
 I prefer stability T-Mobile calls wider coverage area AT&T
; T-Mobile also willing accept unlocked phone service plan without extending contract, require contract provide unlocked phone; AT&T; requires enter 18-month restriction even provide unlocked phone
 Also, T-Mobile's EDGE network nearly three times faster parts AT&T;'s
 I get almost 250 kbits/sec T-Mo's EDGE, AT&T;'s got 100 kbits/sec tops practice
 Also, tethered modem capability available T-Mo's 19
99 data plan, AT&T; include unless spend 65
00/mo data alone
 So, I like T-Mobile 9300, works great


One funny thing 9300 vibrating alert, since I sit type meetings, I actually prefer vibrating alert
 So works funny way
 It somebody made phone me
 It great everything
 Adobe Reader Symbian make errors displaying pdf's while, everything else


 email, internet, phone modem, voice calls, display, calendar alarm functions, applications, speakerphone, conference calls


 everything else works beautifully
 The phone OS totally seamless, though; I think phone OS nearly integrated Windows Mobile smartphone, I actually prefer somewhat seperate
 Once again, somebody must thinking me


The fact phone takes MMC card instead SD, miniSD microSD little wierd, I got decent MMC card go it
 It take 2 GB MMC MMC-Plus card, since MMC cards fit SD readers, I problems
 A nice touch MMC slot allows hot swapping
This phone handily survived couple drops since I got it, scratches, dents, marks, cracks, otherwise result
 It stood nasty situations; getting rained on, sitting hot car, falling onto wooden floor, attacked cat


 It takes lick keeps ticking
Once again, great phone Nokia
 The nicest best phone I ever owned thus far


 

tried use sim cards countrys accept two three states
 

Awesome Product, fully satisfied nokia produce, a, long time nokia product user, though nokia realease product much earlier still worth
 

I owned phone 6 months now
 I talk 3500 minutes month, send recieve 20 emails day
 The phone bunch great capabilities ocassionaly great work companion
 The wide screen excellent viewing
 The cpu functions work little slow could expected small package
 The frustrating part phone frequently works slow well
 When calls lost
 About week necessary take battery let sit minute turning phone on
 The phone takes couple minutes turn on
 Overall, seems slow unstable overshadows great features
 Reminds Windows 98
 

This review 9300i - latest model - listed
 I bought - expensive- phone middle east, configured English UK I come use predictive tect find I get Arabic popping up
 The handbook clearly states Dictionary Options writing Text
 There isnt
 Nor I access predictive text pressing suggested key twice - Nokia models
 My service agents variously told - 'It's ok - use computer keyboard'
 - 'It's available phone' 'Yes phone predictive text'
- It main service agent Dubai returned altered state - predictive text
 I cannot contact sensible person face face get help I need
 NOKIA - get sorted
 How many people come Dubai buy treats get home find spent lot money got bargain hoped for
 

















































































































































Even though description say so, Nokia CSL-17 leather carrying case
 This CSL-27 leather case still lets see keypad display without opening case
 Don't get wrong, nice case looking for
 

First of, case looks really nice
 You slip Nokia 6360 it, Teflon shut rides belt rather like sun glasses case cell phone case
 But cannot easily get operate phone within case
 You CAN hook earphones case, Voice Commands operate phone way, it's one little form-fitting cell phone jackets let get keys, etc
 So it's snazzy, little troublesome
 I like phone small, thin, easily slips cracks car seats, etc
 It looses pockets I can't really get it
 And don't mind walking around dorky ear bud ear barking commands phone use pretty well
 Still, I would preferred older-style case that, cool, useful opinion
 I think cell phones need snap somewhere user, seems wave future
 I needed it, I bought it, it's OK
 

This really carrying case phone
 Once put phone close case cannot see display keybad phone
 I decided get actual leather case phone functional
 

This case made thick stiff cow-hide making large stiff
 The single small belt clip balances case horizontal position falls move around much bulk, gets way falls off
 



I bought Crystal clear case protect new Nokia N95, fits perfectly easily phone, looks great it, I access functions phone plastic delicate, I never dropped yet already crack lines it, I'm affraid I accidentally drop it, break many pieces
 Good idea design, need improve plastic material


 

Got phone cover, fit worked great first day
 Then started getting cracked pocket
 Basically crumbled day 4
 

This case fits well N95 giving access phone's features, looks good it
 However, like reviewers said, grade plastic use manufacture poor
First, scratches way easily
 The case looks great new, weeks use, front chicken scratches makes hard see sun
 Second, brittle
 I never dropped phone usually put phone inside pocket occasionally pant pockets, somehow manage develop cracks corners
If made case better grade plastic resistant scratching durable, I would easily give 5 stars
 

I bought without knowledge whether would fit N95-3
 The front nice fit, back fit
 The case clear perfect fit, would non-intrusive case get, back fitting deal killer me
 Still giving 4 stars, product description never claims fits N95-3
 

2 days
 droped phone floor broke
 throw trash
 worth it
 

Very thin plastic
 Did fit N95 8G advertised
 Find another one
 

Don't even bother, one drop you're screwed
This cheapest plastic casing I ever bought

And I live close chinatown
 

On day I've started use case showed cracks I've read slide one sides
 I would recommend something else


 

This item broke within 24 hours first use
 I remove N95 battery (to reboot device) - case cracked coming off
 Was really careful it



It looks great, fits perfectly, extremely light
It doesn't protect camera lens, breaks almost easily glass
Very unhappy functionality
 Can't made tougher stuff? 

This faceplate provide superior protection (investment) phone - screen protector needed unit
 It practically invisible phone
 Only thing slides ONE WAY
 With case on, slide phone up, access media keys
 Maybe I got defective one, that, I like phone case
 It needs provide access ALL phones' functions
 

battery compartment would stay closed 6 dollar cover stays closed cant beat 





 

This two part clip clear case easy fit - clicks onto N95 TOTALLY PROTECTS phone
In addition, gives phone MUCH BETTER FEEL i
e
 soooo delicate - much solid slightly heavier (which good thing)
The clear case actually covers protects screen - don't need buy protective film product screen
This case REALLY WORKS


Highly Recommended


 

The case designed well
 It fit front better last one I've yet find case really fits back
 However, similar people here, front started cracking corners
 I've month cracks 3 4 corners I'm waiting fall apart completely
 I would recommend trying something else actually use phone
 Mine usually stays desk pocket case failing
 

recieved item broken wouldn't know well works
 say amazon
com works well customers fix problems might merchandise
 

good idea cheap plastic dont even bother it'll crack less week
 never dropped cracked pieces pocket
 

This phone nice I really like it
 The thing lenght battery lack stopwatch
 The price could little bit lower too
 

I read reviews, bad me, got crappie product
 It fits well phone, worth buying it
 Try different housing
 

I purchased hopes would protect N95 allowing clear access features phone
 1) fit phone quite well
 protected everything except camera lens ( concern )
What happened though, day arrived, I put phone
 24 minutes later phone dropped accidentally, top right hand corner cracked quarter inch
 ( drop 1 1/4 feet
 )
I amazed fragile was
So I removed cover, put one phone instead:http://www
amazon
com/Version-Krusell-Dynamic-Multidapt-Leather/dp/B0013L59RO/ref=pd_bbs_6?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1216164213&sr;=8-6Its sturdier, protects phone camera lens better
 pretty clear plastic though
All all, I regret purchase
 

Este cobertor para Nokia N95 ser&iacute;a perfecto si la calidad del pl&aacute;stico fuera superior
El celular luce genial, calza perfectamente sin esfuerzos y sin peligro de que raye el tel&eacute;fono
El problema con este art&iacute;culo es su fragilidad,a mi dur&oacute; tres d&iacute;as y se rasg&oacute; en dos lugares, talv&eacute;s por la presi&oacute;n que ejerce el mismo tel sobre el pl&aacute;stico y eso que nunca se cay&oacute; ni en broma, solo lo andaba en mi bolsillo
 Si quieres ver el tel protegido sin perder su glamour te lo recomiendo pero te deseo mejor suerte que yo y preparate cuidar como y donde lo pones y si se te cae


 dile adi&oacute;s al estuche y Dios quiera que el tel resista el impacto
 

snaps covers n95 pretty nice; rugged material, side cracked one low fall 

This clear case equivalent clear case I picked Europe alot lower cost
 Fast delivery, product stated 



+-ADT 

Product exactly advertised, shipped simple padded envelope offered real protection arrive good condition anyway, works advertised 



































































































































































































































































This wire worked well fixing Seagate 7200
11 hard drive stuck BSY state
 However, come driver software
 I searched days find right driver software finally found following web page: [


]I hope saves people frustration I finding correct driver
 The name file PL2303_Prolific_GPS_AllInOne_1013
exe web page mentioned file inside 
zip file named "win drivers
zip"The wire Prolific product made China
 The sticker USB end says For NOK CA-42 MADE IN CHINA
 The drivers found Nokia site work
Full instructions hard drive fix found [


]Similar instructions found [


]However, web page describes fix using different wire
Sorry advance profanity video (not professional)
 However, instructions worked well
 Also, hard time finding ends crimp wires? I pulled old internal pc speakers
 Final tip: Don't forget update firmware hard drive finished fixing BSY state doesn't happen again
 Go Seagate website correct firmware
 

This USB Cable Nokia 3100, Nokia CA-42 compatable Nokia 3100 Phone
 The reason Nokia gave cable replacement cable original therefore cable work
 You receive enhancement supported error code everytime
 The seller needs look wish continue selling nock offs
 

I able salvage sms, mms, contacts ancient Nokia 6200 using data cable
 And price hard beat
If anyone interested, gnokiirc looked like:[global]model=series40 # varies phone, worked 6200connection=serialport=/dev/ttyUSB1 # probably different depending usb peripheralsFor retrieving mms via gammu, I did:gammu getfilesystemTrawled copious output, looked Folder "Messages" subfolders, gammu getfiles mms attachment:gammu getfiles c:/58gammu getfiles c:/59


Then "gammu readmmsfile $file -save" $file retrieved via "gammu getfiles"
 




















































































































































































































The battery delivered promptly Nokia branded battery
 Apparently old battery stored incorrectly
 Battery life original battery days
 Battery life battery one day stand-by mode only, shorter life talk time added in
 



I bought try rescue data pictures old broken nokia phone
 It work described manufacturer
 The instructions clearly state "free" software download needed nokia website
 This I explain (outdated)
 Almost new laptops sort wireless technology WiFi bluetooth, So nokia phones, connect computer free downloadable software
 If whatever reason need cable means product you

THESE GENERIC CAR CHARGERS FOR NOKIA PHONES WORK JUST AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL ONES
 SAME DESIGN AND WORKS GREAT
 

Based limited research, I believed N95 charger N91 N90
 But either I wrong, charger isn't sized properly
 The power connector loose phone
 It would charge I held taped phone
Plus cigarette plug two springy metal things end springing cigarette lighter receptacle

So all, neither end stays appropriate hole
 I'm bummed out
 Don't order Nokia N95
 




























































I car kit functionality amazing
 The data cable comes handy Nokia phone charges well connects
 Using Bluetooth, connnect Bluetooth compatible phone
 The remote small wheel button center measures inch across mount anywhere, including steering column (which I velcro, included kit
) This way way invisible prying eyes looking anything set car apart target thievery
 The microphone visible piece hides nicely away near visor
 I don't know anyone else there, I nearly several wrecks car motorcycle I beleive could avoided using handsfree device this
 Handsfree law certain states, mine one them, don't get handsfree someone else
 



This good headset Nokia phones
 I Nokia 3120 hard time finding headset acceptable audio quality
 I like answer/end button, don't search phone answer call, quite comfortable wear
 

I used old Nokia phone 3
5mm headset came worked ok me
 New one didn't headset packaged I needed buy one
 The price HDB-4 seemed right I went ahead purchased one
First problem I discovered headset doesn't really fit either ears
 I guess it's designed used ear flat that
 This shape doesn't help fit ears properly I get feeling it's hanging next ear rather it
 I've seen people reporting similar problems stereo Nokia headsets well
Also since sound comes either side headset I believe people next hear conversation (not sure true)
Another painful experience using HDB-4 glasses
 To put ear properly one remove glases first
 Putting glasses headset comfortable (So stick earbud wear glasses)
Sound quality reasonably good
 When I'm indoors people hear Ok
 Outdoors I people complaining I'm sure headphone ones blame
 

Easy use simple design
 Rubberized loop stays put comfortable
 Very good audio quality ends conversation
 No volume control chord could bit longer, on/off switch convenient
 For cost, great addition NOKIA 3587i phone
 

Reason purchase:1
 I blue tooth phone worked well, another item keep charged up
 Plus, blue tooth seems make phone battery last long
2
 Many times I cell phone I need able use two hands
How works:It wonderful
 I hear far one said, "I can't hear sound like well
 So, sound ends call great
It fits equally well either side head
It button headset allows push answer end call
I ordered one day two days here


My negative I buy sooner
 

I headset couple years
 The audio quality consistently excellent
 I worn 3 different pairs glasses; me, fit fine
Compared headsets:- Compared three generations Nokia Earbud, one stays place, doesn't make noise clothing, sounds better
- Compared Jabra Boom headset -- well, I rated headset 1 star
 

The earbud type headsets don't stay ear I bought one
I've using couple years I think, excellent headset
Sound quality good, I especially like answer/disconnect button built mic part
 

I've used headset found great needs
 You use either ear sound clear
 The cord might little longer, worked around
 The (minor) problem need careful adjust position talking, don't press button mic cut call
 

This ear piece much better others I've used
 It rests firmly ear, microphone perfect place doesn't get bumped around
 It disconnect button, too, allows keep eyes road
 Very easy hear through, too
 

This best headset I've owned yet, bargain
 I highly recommend product seller
 

Uncomfortable glasses
But audio quality perfect
My 1st one broke cable internally I used 6 months
 The new one used much


 

If want something cheap, functional, get product
 You get exactly pay for
 It's greatest quality, inexpensive
 I use I bike work enough
 Good casual use
 I &lt;3 earpeice
 

I would say best headset
I thru ones,but I don't mind
I would buy over
I using headset three years I always keep replacement home
 The sound great,even MP3 phone Nokia 6085
I hear everybody everybody hear also
 I loved 


 

It broke within 4 days
 I emailed company took another 3 days reply
 I emailed question still waiting response 6 days later
 

This earpiece nice cheap, tend get pay for
 I paid $20 3 them
 As turns out, microphone 1 doesn't work
They're little uncomfortable ear, due design, over-the-ear clip, comfortable, easy slip off
Bottom line -- you're looking cheap earpiece occasional use, model
 Otherwise, spend least $20 get good one, especially you're planning using earpiece every day
 

greatest headset, everyone talk able hear (and vice-versa) definitely great value
 little tricky getting ear, easy got used it
 

We've gone two these
 Got one phone (Nokia 3300), broke 8 months use
 The replacement broke 6 months
 It's like much choice type phone, uses Nokia-specific adapter, I wish would hold better
 

The sound quality okay, connector always detaches
 I've gone three things connectors break easily
 In fact, I got frustrated Nokia connectors I bought LG phone 3
5MM jack
 

I recieved item less 7 days appear neatly packed mail box
 The rate really cheap quality item beyond value
 

I ordered item weeks later broke
 plugged in, could still use speakerphone radio, earpiece
 unless want constantly replacing earpiece, i'd stick earbud
 

Very bad quality product
 The little connector holder one side got broken first day use :-(But would better quality, head set pretty good design & doesn't bothers ear
 Quality sound average
 

got fast - using I seemed problems cell phone
 Not sure happened seems make phone drop calls
 

I thrilled find headset phone

 I searched Nokia it, either never put market (though I knew made it, I already one) come gone quickly
 I drive using cellphone unless I hands free, crucial
 My son said 'check Amazon', boy, I glad I did

 I bought 3 them, exact right ones

 Thanks much here

 

Gave gift
 She used seems like worked great
 She loved doesn't look like uses anymore
 Probably her
 

This really tolerates much abuse continues work
 I leave headset attached phone full-time, means I'm jamming bag pockets frequently getting dropped tugged yet continues working great sound qualtiy
 I finally buy second one, first lasted impressive amount time considering amount abuse I subjected to
 

Unfortunately, headset work I returned credit
 The speaker function microphone gave garbled sound
 

Sound quality excellent
 The negative comment cord long headsets I owned past
 The cord could 6" longer
 Then I would give item 5 stars
 

I unhappy headset
 It extremely hard hear voices callers hear head set
 I longer use it
 

I chance use many headsets
This probably best found market nokia 6800
 Great buy
 

hey , please let know , available , go 













I purchased headset specifically independant on/off button
 Most headsets, on, prevent handset ringing
 When off, take upwards three five seconds turn on
 Since I wear headset time problem I want hear handset ring able turn headset answer call
Interestingly, HDW-3 circumvents problem entirely allowing handset headset ring time
 If I wearing headset I hear ring tone ear, also phone
 If headset matter pressing on/off button second activate headset take call wirelessly
 Very convenient
The sound quality good, headset supports phone audio, standard audio, voice dialing
Bluetooth connectivity snap
 Whenever headset turned discoverable ten minutes
 No fiddling headset buttons make connection necessary
 The headset connect maximum eight devices, one time
 The first device pairs default device, always try connect device first turned on
 If cannot connect default device attempt connect last connected device default
One thing really threw absence AC adapter headset
 Since headset Nokia apparently expect customer already Nokia phone
 The headset works several different Nokia AC adapters, nice, don't already one you're faced purchasing seperate item use device
 Very poor decision Nokia's part, especially $100 original retail price
The ear loops rubber bits sort snap onto headset
 They're somewhat stiff uncomfortable worn incorrectly
 Getting right fit difficult
 There two different sized loops included, doesn't really account much variation people's ear shapes sizes
 I've found wearing larger loop upside provides comfortable fit
 It's comfortable enough short term wear I wanted anyway
The odd little membranous buttons top unit volume
 They're bit hard press since they're tiny, it's hard tell you're actually pressing wearing device
Overall, I like unit
 It sounds good, works h6315 way I want to, lightweight
 Nokia dropped ball wearability failed include AC adapter
 If you're looking headset wear necessary, you've already got Nokia adapter laying around great sounding, easy use device
Pros:Easy connectivityLightweight sharp lookingSounds greatPhone headset ring time
Independant on/off switchCons:No AC adapter includedUncomfortable ear pieceBizarre volume buttons 

I've owned 3wks I like it:-VERY small light weight
-mic sensitive clear-earpiece sound quality almost hearing headset-battery life close what's advertised-it looks really cool
What I don't like it:-volume buttons small hard get atI used Jabra BT headset I'm glad I switched
 The Nokia dedicated on/off switch versus Jabra's "press hold button 5sec turn off" switch
 Belive me, saves wealth convenience
 

Mic
 sens
 windy street conditions, inside perfect
 If talk lot something like 40-70 min/day, battery last 1-1
5 days
Cons: cant leave charger night, kill battery within 1-2 months
 

The battery life excellent, uses recharger cord Nokia phone, convenient travel
 It's excellent improvement corded headset around terrific device
My next purchas definitely Nokia device, I come back provide review 2 months initial purchas
 These things I would consider prior purchase
1) Volume could louder--I sometimes difficult time hearing others
 This usually case me
2) This device picks wind I walk
 People asked I breathing heavy
 That's funny I'm pretty good shape, device quite sensitive others claim hear well
Despite minor shortcomings, I go back Nokia next phone headset purchases
 

I bought HDW-2 three years ago returned almost immediately various problems
I bought HDW-3 year ago like except two primary issues
First, impossible use outside wind drowns communication
Second, large earpiece broke--not electronics, plastic attachment--and Nokia customer service tells "the earloop Nokia HDW-3 Wireless Headset user-replaceable part available sale send out
" Egads--I buy whole new unit
 

Not quite I expecting, it's OK
 It didn't originally come charger, one real common
 I eventually get one job
 The unit larger I expected, still relatively lightweight
 The ear-hook real easy secure, relatively comfortable, 2 supplied unit
 

It works anytime away phone reset connection 

This thing crap
 The "large" ear piece rather small broke within week
 Nokia *promised* twice would send replacement ear clip never did
 Eventually became expensive (but light) paperweight
 I'm sure tons better market
 Don't waste money
 

Sounds Quality Good, Good Price
 I tried Nokia 6230 Phone
 You use battery charger phone use
 












































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The finest cell phone I've use
 Very stylish
 The camera useful
 


















A lot less expensive buying directly Nokia T Mobile
 Works intended flawlessly
 Sf Planet delivered two business days
 

Works like champ
 Bluetooth prohibited office, OK security folks faster boot
 The downside connector bit tricky line right phone
 

delivery two days ahead schedule product exactly I needed
 Thank 




 I wanted cable able upgrade Firmware phone, somehow work
 It work Nokia, doesn't



 still good quick sync Infrared slower USB
 

works like supposed daughter's new phone
 it's pain buy brand name cable understand off-brand cables don't always work
 worked like supposed to
 

These cables excellent dealer sold reasonable price
 realize download software use cables
 













































I've used standard ear plugs Nokia phone - plug hurts ear isn't really comfortable
 Plus, mic picks wind noise
The Jabra EarBoom - none problems - extremely comfortable - uni-directional mic gives excellent sound quality - transmission reception
Highly recommend it
 

I love ear piece headset clip already fallen apart I less 6 months used much
 Without clip I always disconnecting people disconnect button cord
 I bummed don't want buy another I afraid thing happen
 

I earboom one ever hear I call driving
 I Toyota Corolla quiet ride
 Even windows radio off, cannot hear me
 The ear volume also low even highest volume adjustment
 I wish I would tried models first
 

The earpiece nice relatively comfortable
 The microphone quality isn't good
 This earboom-type product I tried, I can't compare others
 I hope brands better microphone doesn't pick sounds well unless quiet environment
 I find I speak loudly people understand I using driving (which whole point buying one these) frustrates person I called
 It isn't bad stopped traffic, however doesn't work well driving
 Perhaps car less wind noise 1997 Honda Civic


 

I tried hands free headsets market
 The Jabra EarBoom headset I purchased Nokia phone excellent
 I especially like different size earjells came it
 I small ears smaller size fits perfectly
 I one problem I lost one small pieces
 

Don't waste time product
 I two two weeks time
 Both stopped working
 It appears get slight bend cord breaks wire
 Even work sound quality great
 

This great product
 The unit I on/off button cord also
 Ear gels take days get use feel like glove
 The sound quality great
 The microphone excellent
 The complaint wire plug comes straight bottom instead side like Nokia plug
 Great Value all
 

Surprisingly comfortable
 Sound quality good ear/mouth boom overall quality ear piece great
 There far less 'tinny' sounds 'stock' Nokia product (this 6160 Nokia Phone) ear piece (which costs well)
 Overall happy fit, sound quality Jabra Earboom
 Nice deal
 

If weren't slightly flimsy connection EarBoom cell phone (Nokia only), would best cell phone accessory is
 I mine three years reason I need buy another connection finally failed (too loose)
 The reason wife needed another unit amount time fitted earpiece selected (you get three sizes ear)got lost almost inexpensive get entirely new unit rather getting replacement eargels
 I NO problems bending wire reviews state
 I actually keep entire unit old, hardshell eyeglass case keeps intact pices stay together
This ONLY microphone I've ever callers could hear clearly I could hear clearly
 I would definitely recommend earphone/microphone
 

I've thing while(1 year) I hear well enough, sometimes irritates ear
 The microphone leaves lot desired
 When foam microphone cover disintegrated I bought Jabra Earwave boom headset desperation I find earpiece comfortable even though I wear glasses "over ear" design works fine best part microphone, people hear clearly conversations easier now
 I'd say better EarBoom
 Get EarWave Boom instead
 

I used Nokia earbud came cellular phone, never seemed fit comfortably, stay ear
 I came realize ears small accomodate Nokia earpiece properly
 The beauty Jabra Earbud little rubber earpiece cover comes 3 sizes
 Not sized fit comfortably, shaped fit snuggly securely within curves ear
 The kit includes 6 color-coded covers Small, Medium, Large
 Each size comes left right model, even choose side head prefer wear earpiece
 The sound quality microphone, earpiece excellent
 Jabra great job one, price can't beat
 

I found Jabra loved I tried it
 I loved product b/c shape earpiece
 Why don't manufacturers realize inside ears round like earpeices? *shrug*I didn't problem loosing eargels b/c one size fit ear I preferred one side
 So others useless
 I guess maybe gel come pretty easily, b/c problem I earpeice underneath coming apart
 A little piece broke stayed together gel intact
This I started looking another one
 I would've repeat customer it, I haven't found local area stores
 Thanks Amazon, I'll able get another one
 I tried normal round earpeice, even boom
 It comfortable ear Jabra
 I'd rather buy another Jabra
The thing I wonder would I better Jabra EarBoom? I drive Jeep road noise sometimes makes hard people hear talking
 

I got ear piece months ago loved much


I stick little earpiece ear walk around hands free


the small mic clips shirt clearly heard caller


It's it's good u shoppin walkin streets

and I want color coordinate also comes matchin earpiece covers


I Love 

I Jabra hands free earbud works great me
 I don't get noise distortion like earbuds
 I highly recommend this
 

Idea great, connector cheap jarring swift removal/disconnection ruin tangs create connection
 Mine lasted 4 months
 I bought another Jabra , different model, tangs Nokia connections (maybe 2
5 mm
 plug would better)


 dead five months
 These poorly made items
 Period
 If want buy one, better buy two three
 

Well, I've used this, I also used Nokia earbud came phone
 One thing I've noticed connector Nokia phones fragile
 I dropped phone connected quality noticably declined (same included earbud)
 After I people hard time hearing me, another reviewer mentiond
 I also problem loosing gel covers
 I went 3 them, repeatedly fell off
 The last failure mode earpiece itself
 It got caught completely fell apart
 I using retractable earbud standard plug Nokia adapter
 Much better quality I ever either included earbud
 Also, Nokia adapter replacable, I've eliminated one failure mode
 

I struggled many different types hands free devices I found product
 I love it
 It fits comfortably ear (thanks 3 sizes ear pieces provided) everyone I talk says hear perfectly
 I also hear perfectly
 I really recommend product
 

The nice thing I say product comfortable earpiece
 Their ear-gels fit like glove quite comfortable
 However, I couldn't hear mine well
 Furthermore, microphone practically mouth order heard
 That may I frequently drive windows open, even windows closed car slightly (but slightly) noisier average
 I currently market something else point
 
























































































































































































































































































































































































































































Alot people written reviews phone me, I must say none people Amazon wrote review got anywhere near truth
This phone indeed slow
 The Symbian software it's flaws, nothing take seriously
 This phone everything says does, better assumes
The bluetooth connectivity one fastest I seen far, I owned 7+ phones
 Infared become obsolete, nice gimmick infared port PC laptop, although data cable faster, might also one thing forget travels abroad
 And moments I sure much apreciate little black square bottom device
So much connectivity, options
Th keyboard pleasant text messages emails flow device within minute so, I experianced
It also everything computer can: numbers, symbols letters included course, even things ctrl+c copy highlighted text, ctrl+v paste
 Highlighting done pressing ctrl upwards arrow (located right next it) time
 Very pleasant indeed
The joystick work excellent makes navigating much easier controlled
The screen vibrant clear even broad daylight
 Bad thing screen wallpapers cover entire homescreen, I would liked see
 A complete log makes however, large clock makes easy time reading
The possibilities endless, open Microsoft Office document, simplified applications wich compared major Office tools
Mobile internet looks works best I've ever seen
 No longer jump line line, full cursor available works well one laptop/PC
 On top websites load fairly quick, even though I GoPhone user
Pictures look gorgeos, videos look well bit jittery, music plays well loud integrated speaker voice recorder works well also
IM works good mobile device, although keyboard makes typing much easier
Google maps nice addition
 But maybe suitable GoPhone users sucks money like crackhead
The signal pretty good, worse better phones battery life truly amazing
 Using push-email baby carefull it's juice, spill whatsoever
Various ringtones, wallpapers, videos games may downloaded sites Zedge, phone store quite mini SD card needed
I happy Goliath (sizewise), even doesn't wifi even camera matter
 Most it's functions it's striking versatility make it
 Especially 50 bucks eBay
 A handy thing run store bussines person needs something (but necessarily to) replace laptop conveniance
 

I'm upset I bought cell phone page seller didn't fill expectations
 Here resume happened:I bought cell phone Nov 6th 2009 following link:http://www
amazon
com/Nokia-Unlocked-Bluetooth-Slot-U-S-Warranty/dp/B000OCJYN8/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s;=wireless&qid;=1257517626&sr;=1-12it important let I'm Costa Rica I send cell phone friend address NY brought Costa Rica
First I try charge nothing happen
 Then I contact friend cellular support business Costa Rica told battery damaged
 Then try buy battery model Costa Rica impossible
Being advice situation send email seller Feb 8th 2010 moment I haven't receive response yet today Feb 25thI bought another battery order make works cell phone I bought since November 2009 hoping God new battery cell works successfully
 

I used phone 3 years ago
 After finally decided go bad dropped many times, went another provider
 After contract ran up, went back original provider I bought iPhone 3gs big mistake
 I mean don't want bash iPhone, everything phone (correctly mean)
 So saw phone, immediately bought remembered quality Nokia puts phones
As smartphone goes, bit slower average phone, personally didn't mind speed difference
 I love menu ease use
 Since good past experience Nokia, pretty much brainer
 Plus unlocked :D
I recommend phone anybody wants quality smart phone
 

This phone nerfed version E61
 The phone unlocked may possibly get around java restriction imposed locked Cingular version, processor slow (slow menu transition limited 3rd party app use), Wi-Fi removed version, it's 3G phone
 Shop around, find much better phone around price
 

This model WiFi
This model camera
Skip buy nice Nokia e61i N95-3
 They far better choices
 

Don't even think it
 You regret buying phone I did
 Extremely slow open applications
 Crashes constantly specially using phone modem
 I happy it
 I gotta stick I get e71 according CNET reviews excellent
 

I phone three months keys keep sticking
 It doesn't compute hang up, take batteryt end call
 I called At & T sent replacement


 much worse first one
 This one new added problems cutting conversations loud noise blank air
 They shouldnt sell phone
Two experiences phone, HORRIBLE
 

didn't pay attention cellphone doesn't equipt camera din't canciled purchase otherwise every thig excellent 

Purchased model file compatibilities (pdf,xls,doc,etc) plus ability take daily notes, writing
 Also nice one could select arbitrary mp3s ringtones
The keyboard fairly useless bluetooth keyboard eventually fixed that
 However, getting notes docs thing difficult
 Drag drop implemented (God knows why)
 Exporting text thru Outlook ONLY option far I tell
 major PITA
The sound quality nearly incomprehensible, way works well speaker phone
The operating system runs snail's pace, startup tasks slow
To listen MP3s it, one needs purchase special headphones
It tendency freeze
 Once does, thing pull battery, replace it, restart phone
This worst phone I ever owned
 I never purchase Nokia again
 Avoid can
 









































































































































































































































Product received Nokia original exactly I need avoid carring 2 chargers (2 mm 4mm) 

For anyone who's owned previous generation Nokia phones, need buy/carry extra chargers
Plus, it's often easy find someone older nokia charger need one (eg
 work pinch etc) 

My wife I Nokia phones different charger adapters, two separate chargers bring along whenever go road
 With adapter, bring one
Just make sure don't misplace though
 With small form factor, it'll likely take longer find it
 

Excelente producto, peque&ntilde;o y f&aacute;cil de usar, para aquellos que poseen cargadores de la anterior genereraci&oacute;n de Nokia
 

I multiple Nokia phone's great able carry one charger I travel
 This adapter connects old Nokia chargers charge new phones like Nokia E61i
 

This product people nokia chargers changed phones ones carry smaller pin
 It expensive convenient
 You keep old charger charge new phone
 

Whichever Nokia products work with, NOT function Nokia E51
 It would cost postage return USA cost
 It would helpful would spell clearly work nokia phones take 2
5mm plug
If inserted Nokia E51, generates message, "Enhancement supported"
Suggest check carefully beforehand whether work particular Nokia
The picture represent sent
 

This adaption work Nokia E71 Phone
The adapter I received different appearance photo
When I plunged adapter headset Nokia E71
The phone reports "Accessory Supported"
I wish Nokia would follow established standards signed onto supporting member
I bought adapter hoping I could use real nice Plantroics headset phone luck
 

I bought item hoping able use standard Plantronics headset, volume low make unusable
I also tried Sony mono headset, standard earbud headset, cheap 4 conductor headset
 The latter work all, two also low volume unusual
 Very disappointing
 

Can imagine waiting months tiny little package? If problem, order product seller
 I ordered October 2006 December I emailed asking okay delayed shipping February 2007
 

I bought mother replace earplug went one didn't even last 2 weeks stoped working
 Also, dosen't show picture, wire spiral kind, straight wire, another negative item
 I'd give item 0 stars I could
 

Works well, days jack already needs tweaking middle call get sound back
 Could broken unit
Not bad price,This second purchase, first purchase lemon, Amazon returned immediately, questions asked, replaced current one
For old Nokia like I I'm satisfied headset
 

The way I could locate item web
 I like product works really well Nokia phone
 It definately worth money
 

These fit all



the stem went phone kept coming out


and clothes clip slipped stay inplace
 They said Nokia 6010 mess


The position speaker way low ear bud
 

Although supposed work cell phone model, not
 






































































































THis phone actually bad
Pros
-It full color screen- Gets good reception- Lightweight-has txt messaging get now-many built ringtones wallpaper screenCons
-its folding phone now-Its little heavy side takes roomGets warm aftera half hour useThats happy cell phone hunting
~ 

This phone seriously great
 It's color lot ringtones, download tones games Verizon Wireless
 I'm 12, phone perfect age I can't get bored like I old phone
 It doesn't camera anything, I don't need one anyway
 This great phone
 If looking cell phone, BUY THIS ONE
 


My old devie one Dell X 51V Pocket-Pc Windows Mobile 5
0
My new device Nokia E62
I use professional personal live, love it
I use to:- send receive e-mails ( MS Exchange, Hotmail, Gmail, others ),- browse web ( screen great, see real sites ),- write documents meetings ( use one hand write good speed ),- talk Messenger,- listen music ( sound great ),- play backgammon ( Fox Cunning ) and- read lot documents like spreadcheets, PDFs PPTs
To perfect professional personal device
 

This phone great features great potential
 But that's stops
 It extremely slow respond accessing different programs freezes frequently
 It also least week answer speaker phone mode subsequently freeze up
 The keypad easily bumped it's locked, even third part autolock software, accidentally calls people quite often
So summary, free new activation less $100 Cingular rebates contract looks promising, get pay for
Don't buy phone
 

Cons: As previousely mentioned reviews, phone frustratingly slow
 When sending text messages, takes good 90 seconds send
 The keyboard stiff all, least I don't think so, bit goofy type compared Nokia 6822 (a phone I would deffinately recommend text lovers)
 One reviewer mentioned backlight doesn't come pressing key
 I found bit annoying well, I pressed power key, turned backlight keys locked
 The annoying feature phone voice recorder button
 It located upper left side, easily pressed
 And press it, automatically starts recording
 I've bumped several times, automatic recording plus slow loading time real pain
Pros: It displays "to-do" items right home screen, excellent sound quality mp3 playback, it's loud enough hear I'm blaring music car
Overall: If you're willing hard reset phone every 4-6 months, don't mind waiting least minute phone anything, go right ahead buy it
 But you're right mind, don't even bother
 I'll keep phone getting new one, I really like calander detailed address book; phone calls, text messaging, surfing web, features sort, I'd find different phone
 

Wonderful keyboard
 I've watched movie phone



read PDF short story listened music
 Nokia PC Suite works Vista right box without updates lots great features
 I don't use phone email office apps
 I wanted phone could everything I got it
 

I switched cingular 8125 phone couldn't happier
 The cingular phone required two hands operate (because touch screen) unless clever enough figure use voice activate
 The cingular phone user-UNfriendly
 With E62 I use one hand joy stick works like champ - don't know can't put lap tops instead "mouse button"
 Getting around programs easy
 Without camera much lighter
 It easier read font ring tones also louder Cingular phone I hear purse
 Wonderful
 If hate using touch screens, get phone
 

I work Major cell phone provider -- I can't recommend phone anyone based support Nokia offers
Don't get wrong great phone packed great features
 The thing I would want add camera, since I don't use cell phone take pictures much isn't big deal
My problem phone stopped working
 While surfing web, suddenly quit working regardless I turned phone on, would never come back
 Fine it's warranty right, ship back Nokia right? Nokia phone month -- can't fix due lack spare parts
 They also can't send new phone -- claim lack supplies
 They offered refund, going take additional 4 - 6 weeks
 If outside Cingular 30 days, choice send back Nokia
For buy phone, I'm telling Nokia support way par basically you're something goes wrong
 I would recommend going Palm , Blackberry, Motorolla purchasing phone I better support products
 Those purchase phone probably opt kind data plan go it
 My experience would leave paying cellphone service data plan two months I couldn't use service phone can't fixed Nokia
 

It almost everything
 So short:The bad:- Slow using, much
- Slow oppening office files
 Takes 2 minutes windows mobile take 2 seconds
The good:- Amazing screen
- Blackberry connect
- Lots third party apps, like handy calendar papyrus
- Very good web browser, mini map page miniatures
- There FREE msn client avalaible
 You pay data, uses mb /month
Overall, it's solid device, well made, everything want to
 

This phone known battery life issues
 After 6 months battery doesnt last longer one day
 Software excruciatingly slow moving menue menue
 During one billing period phone connected internet itselft 1,500 times
 AT&T's solution: disable data access
 Mercifully, E-62 discontinued, advised steer clear
 

I chose phone Blackjack screen size, keyboard ergonomics, ability sync Outlook travelling (via RoadSync, built-in email sync app)
 For past 2 months, WAS great business phone despite lack Wi-Fi, camera, fast internet
 However, critical flaw: DO NOT let battery run charge phone
 While normally good thing battery life, E62 power accept charging charger it's battery totally drained
 Looking Symbian user forums, commony referred "the White Screen"
 Symptoms: If battery drained plug wall charger phone, dim white screen appears (despite phone powered off) NOKIA brand shows, white screen returns
 Your phone get charged
 If try power up, difference brighter white screen
 But nothing logo appear
I checked 3 different ATT stores area none E62, battery, battery-only cradles accessory phone (despite big promotions less 3 months earlier)
 One employee said way get accessories via website
 So I can't even go store see phone power charged battery
Right now, phone still briefcase
 I switched SIM another phone work isn't affected issue
I probably switch blackjack blackberry now
 Too bad since I used big fan
 

I loved phone much I switched T-mobile Cingular phone
 What I didnt love way Cingular charged roughly $40 phone I paying T-mobile
 I sidekick love death

 But I wanted switch something professional, I got Nokia e 62 walking cingular falling instantly love
 Eventually, though I switched back t-mobile cause I paying less
 Then I found unlocked version ebay worked T-mobile snatched up
 I ended going back sidekick though
 This phone definately professionals
 This phone everything
 Internet, web, long long long standby life
 I think I went 5 days without charging it
 The qwerty keyboard amazing
 The menu easy navigate
 The sound amazing


 Speakerphone world
 The internet little bit slow, well worth wait clarity alone
 The screeen clear big
 The phone also skinny

 The average Joe like probably find phone overwhelming, I said, small empire run, you

 I'm actually reselling phone website I got within next week, youre interested take look
 This phone definately amazing

 

So I wanted upgrade, get phone would help increase productivity allow e-mail internet functionality
 The Nokia it, I'm afraid
It's even great phone, several pretty nasty habits
 For one, randomly set profiles one I set it, means occasion ring it's supposed silent, use ringtone I didn't select, - several noteworthy occasions - set "offline," meaning ingoing outgoing calls
Last week randomly deleted numbers saved speed dial I reset all
It's little things
 For instance, select "log," click two extra screens see recent calls, complete waste time
 The interface intuitive easy use like smartphones, web functionality pretty much crap
 I say: first phone I've ever I really liked using speakerphone
 So there's that
I've never happy Nokia phone, experience one, I'm never buying another Nokia again
 

It's slow

 almost useless
I can't even think email/web etc
 

[Since I really scoured web researching E62 I got one Cingular


 I owe web/usenet community post experiences
]This good looking PDA phone
 My family subscribed Cingular Family plan, I looking good PDA phone Cingular, rather go thru hassle switching carriers get juicy BB Pearl EVDO offering


 E62 came out, appeared everything I needed PDA phone (looks features)
 I knew didn't WiFi (disappointing), but, well, I thought one Media Bundles, hype EDGE, I hoped E62 prove convenient efficient PDA phone
There three ways look phone considering using Cingular
1
 As standalone device
2
 Cingular's data plans suitable PDA/phone
3
 The usability E62 combined Cingular's data plans
There many aspects device, I able touch all, I'll try update review times submitting this
1
 As standalone device
Beautiful screen
 16million colors
 The PDA sharp looking, even Cingular stamp it
 The QWERTY keboard really awesome
 Wider Treo comfortable type
 If haven't used Palm OS, you'll love general interface well
 But used Palm (or maybe even Pocket PC), Symbian desktop needs little getting used to
 Switching app app delays (2 5 seconds sometimes)
 The Menu confusing times
 Will need spend hours really get know use device efficiently
The E62 scroll wheel; touch screen
 It joystick, quite convenient move cursor screen
 I still felt clickable scroll wheel side would good addition
The built-in browser Ok, confusing save bookmarks, go new URL
 The calendar good new PDA user
 But used Datebook Datebook+, calendar simplistic
 I installed mobile google maps app
 Looks good PDA
 But, irritating popup comes everytime asking "Allow application Google Maps use network send recieve data?"
 Even I click "Yes", doesn't remember


 ask seconds google tries get new data move map
 I didn't find easy way persist setting
 This irristating popup happen apps too
 (pop email example)
 So right there, that's big negative
 Some browsing experience becomes unpleasant right away stuff
Browsing sites google news bad
 The page loading times take anywhere 4 12 seconds (using Cingular's EDGE)
 A little long taste
The E62 comes Instant Messaging App Yahoo, MSN hotmail
 I tried Yahoo IM
 The outgoing messages go quickly
 Incoming messages big lag
 Upto 10 seconds, sometimes even 30 secondss
 So, interactive fast typers


 high speed IMers
 (For me, personally, delays really disconcerting) Still, could useful stuck train (with good EDGE coverage
) long line Drivers license office
Personally, I felt EDGE hype really super fast
 I hear good things EV-DO camp (that Verizon provides)
 People compared EVDO EDGE consistently said EVDO blazing fast
Very sleek thin light weight
 It slip easily hands though
 Does ergonomic rubber grip anything sort sides
 A good 3rd party case alleviate problem
 (If looking Blackberry type holster, luck
 Cingular doesn't provide case phone) (Blackberry users used BB behaving differently senses holster
 The E62 intelligence)Voice quality Excellent
 5 stars one
 Speaker phone beautiful, good polyphonic support
 Very convenient quickly record audio memos too
Contacts/Addressbook Ok
 Not good Palm's Blackberry's
Excellent battery life, even using multimedia features
 I haven't timed it, almost full day intermittently using experimenting PDA, battery went notch half
2
 Cingular's data plan
Whoever heading Cingular's Marketing department, hasn't done enough know prime Customer product
 I got phone business use, regular personal use
 Going web page, I believed I could sign Cingular's Media Max 200 bundle 19
99/month (unlimited web, 200 text msgs)
 The operator first added Media Max, realized I E62, basically said, sorry, can't plan


 proposed saw plan screen - A PDAConnect plan 59
99 (unlimited)
 This completely sync Cingular's web page "PDAConnect" plan
 They DataConnect plans ranging 19
99 44
99
 But Cingular operator (she nice though) could see plans screen
 Finally found DataConnect plan 44
99 somewhere (but cheaper ones) put plan
At point, personal user, I'm wondering 44
99 worth it
 Well, browsing experience quick fast, could be
 But browsing experience great, I mentioned above
 (I also plan download Opera mini see part web usage becomes better)
Cingular prominently inform customers compatible data plans phone purchase phone itself
 I got bad surprise one
3
 Nokia E62 Cingular:Since EDGE "high speed" Cingular's network isn't great


 lack built-in WiFi BIG drawback E62
 (You buy unlocked E61 WiFi)
 I found EDGE performance varies place place
 At fastest, average web response times 4 8 seconds (and pages longer)
 Some pages time out
 The included browser Ok, great
 Most places I go, I see WiFi coverage (libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, work place, course home), poor Edge coverage
 The data/web experience E62 unsatisfactory - would much better WiFi support
If want use regular phone, PDA (without data plan), excellent choice
 (with drawbacks I mentioned above; as: slow switching apps, slow startup apps, slippery form factor)
 Will good mp3s (has miniSD slot supporting 2Gig card), photographs, video
 Symbian good 3rdParty software available (not extensive Palm PocketPC)
 btw, miniSD slot hidden battery cover
 So, card can't easily popped out
 I think people may like this, others may want easy access miniSD card
If plan use Data plan, I don't recommend it
 I say I haven't used Blackberry Connect GoodLink one, I don't think plans drastically increase performance device
 Having BB plan could give good email performance (but then, get Blackberry, really awesome email/calendar Outlook syncing)
I love phone, I left lingering disappointment
 I fell love phone even I bought :( 


 lovely look awesome screen, but, but, I may end returning Cingular within 30 day trial period :( 
Good luck choice
 I'll try update page I use phone more
 (It's day since I got it)
 Oh, btw, there's whole fun world Access Point settings *could* get PDA


 that's another time

[edit/update: July 2007, six months later
 Music player, miniSD access, bluetooth connectivity update "UGLY"
]I phone little month writing
 My previous phones Motorola v180 Sierra Voq (with Windows Mobile)
 I bought upgrade/contract extension Amazon, provides great price compared Cingular, even though contract extension disqualifies Amazon rebate
There extensive reviews, I'll try keep point:(with apologies Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood)The Good:1
 GREAT battery life: 4 days ~4
5h talk time one charge
2
 Well-designed QWERTY keyboard: excellent taking notes (get used stiff keys)
3
 Decent/good call quality
4
 Good build quality (no cheap plastic)5
 Stiff keys - keypad unlocked phone pocket, keys *shouldn't* get pressed (but see Ugly #1 below)
6
 MiniSD slot - 2 GB cards cheap
 EDIT: miniSD card EASY TO REMOVE, even physically battery
 You don't remove battery
7
 It's Windows (no crashes/freezes far)
8
 Pre-configured MediaNet access, I use access Gmail/Google Maps
9
 Gmail/Google Maps work look great, except Bad #1
10
 Bluetooth (e
g
 headset Bad #6)
11
 Lovely screen
12
 Can sync seamlessly M$ Outlook, using Nokia's PC Suite (included)
13
 Nice Nokia wired headset answer/end button microphone stub
 Holding mic near mouth helps significantly, though
14
 [UPDATE]The iPhone hubbub made try music playing capabilities (haven't much success movies)
 The Nokia Music Manager pretty nice, convert MP3s/AACs eAACs, produces - - acceptable audio quality ~1/4th file size (my MP3s usually 320 kbps)
 Useful biking (mandatory safety warning - I pay extra attention bikes behind me)
15
 [UPDATE] I recently got Sony bluetooth stereo headset DR-BT10X, works well music, seems good/OK calls
The Bad: (mostly minor)1
 Cingular restricted options Java applications like Gmail Google Maps "never allow access" "always ask" - Nokia manual gives two options ("always allow" and, I think, "allow time")
 So want move, say, little left Google maps, agree allow Google Maps Internet access, even re-select MediaNet
2
 SLOW opening applications, sometimes gets frustrating, e
g
 looking address book
 UPDATE: This still makes mad times


3
 Stiff keys pain
4
 When keypad locked, backlight doesn't come press key - save battery life, want look time, say, unlock keypad, lock putting phone away
 But see Good #5
5
 Locking keypad requires pressing two keys (On Voq - press "call end" hold seconds
)6
 Can't really hold phone ear shoulder - kind bulky, makes chore hold up
7
 Alarm clock actually resides Menu\Office\ folder
8
 [UPDATE: See Good #15] Plantronics 340 bluetooth headset - experience less encouraging dropped connections, could headset's fault
9
 I still trying figure way rip non-copy-protected DVDs I use 2 GB MiniSD card lovely screen
10
 No WiFi (The non-Cingular Nokia E61 WiFi)
11
 I never camera phone, lack camera doesn't bother - much
The Ugly:1
 The Saturday I left conference, phone trouser pocket, keypad locked
 But I bent sat down, phone mysteriously turned off
 This happened 3 4 times day
 I took Voq along backup, thankfully problem hasn't recurred
 UPDATE: This recurred occasion, DON'T BEND OVER phone trouser pocket
Overall, I happy phone, mostly also PDA
 The Nokia doesn't narrow form factor Sierra Voq (see review there), great screen long battery life make it
 Now Cingular would stop crippling phone


 

Okay, here's good:a) keyboard kicks butt
 Dont listen anyone says different
 They clueless SureType loving nuts
 Hey dont listen me, try yourself
b) The phone relatively slim devices category
 Exhibit A: Blackberry 9700
c) User interface mostly awesome
 Phone calls placed forefront UI, be
 Look Tmobile MDA excellent example NOT design phone
d) supports BlackBerry Connect well Good messaging
 Sweet

Okay, bad:a) Sloooooow
 The damn device freaking slow
 It makes TMobile MDA Treo look good, takes lot since devices set performance bar pretty damn low
b) No Wi-Fi, No 3G, No Camera
c) Cingular (of course)
 The IM client ships E62 USES ONE TEXT MESSAGE FOR ONE IM
 Do get ripped using IM client, Cingular decided okay screw customers humonguous text message bills (I sent 900 texts one month unwittingly account IM client) even though already pay upwards $45 dollars data channel
 What scam


 I downloaded Agile Messenger 20 bucks use data pipes IM
 Take that, evil carrier
The Ugly:a) Slow
 Oh god, it's slow
 

I got phone replacement I dropped treo 650 toilet
I say, it's really awesome design
 Very comfortable sound quality way better treo, one biggest gripes
There one major problem though I feel duty make known
 The java support phone crippled cingular developers pay applications work without annoying pop message every couple clicks
 Had I known would bought something elseRecently google released 2 breakthrough mobile applications, google maps gmail mobile, virtually unusable preconceived handicap
If cingular (who exclusive US contract device)removes limitation, would best phone I've ever used
 As now, makes feel ripped off
 Search net, see yourself
 

Had phone week now
 The beautiful design functions attracted it
 First let say phone bought replace treo 650
 The phone sleek, lighter treo wider
 The screen beautiful 16M colors, beats treo
 The screen also bigger treo pixels treo negligible
 The Nokia built AOL IM, MSN IM Yahoo IM, treo none
 The internet looks much better device loads much faster treo did
 This phone push email, meaning email come directly phone without logging onto Internet
 The themes beautiful phone whereas treo stuck light blue home screen numbers
 You get numerous new themes various sites free
 Sound quaility excellent using bluetooth headset much clearer treo
 The battery life outstanding
 Nokias PC suite lets connect internet using laptop fantastic, fast enough even watching video slingbox
Some things I don't like phone slower treo, hit key lag
 This phone touch screen nice joystick navigator
 There NO camera probably biggest gripe phone aimed corporate users aren't allowed cameras obvious reasons
 text msg easy use treo
All great device I love play don't think i'm going sell treo second phone (just switch sim cards) case emergency battery runs something happens phone whatever reason
 If can, get unlocked E61, builtin WIFI phone doesn't
 

After using 2 weeks
 This far best mobile phone I used
 It better sound quality better signal sensitivity previous Nokia Motorola I used
 I tried phones would work I live due low signal strgength
 Unlike smart phones E62 really works phone
 The speaker phone function great quality sides conversationAs PDA, works well
 It takes little practice moving Palm touch screen unlike Palm fully operated one hand
 Used thumb board, keyboard fast
 It tools read edit MS Office documents
 These limited available memory
 Using headset speaker phone, easily look dates, contacts details using phone
I seen criticisim applications slow start
 Compared Palm, true
 Compared MS based devices I seen not
 The big difference Palm need start applications powering on
 After started, switch quite easily
 Even better, come back application, exactly point left, like switching windows PC
It also works great MP3 player
 The built speakers truly amazing
 The video playback impressive Nokia support video resolution properly fills screen
 I recommend using tool like Super
 It create much better 3GP Nokia PC Suite
 On flip side playing 2 hour movie compressed 135MB 3GP using built speakers PC synch file transfers takes top one five bars battery strength
 So certainly practical use E62 media player well phone PDA
 It shame Mini SD cards come bigger 2GB
Battery life seems reasonable
 I getting three plus days normal use charge
 This week four full days normal use still enogh battery power left play 90 minute movie
 My previous Nokia 6200 Palm M500 typically lasted 2 3 days per charge
 Therefore, slightly improved battery life previous dedicated units one device charge carry around
My real complaints meetings entered unit default 'private' instead public
 Annoying take time change work team shared calendars
 The Sheet application built 'Office Suite'
 It fine viewing Excel spreadsheets building Nokia extremely annoying
 There three step process (quick) unlock cell write it
 If creating documents mobile, buy QuickOffice S60 get compatible version
Nokia take hint Sony-Erricson host software download site
 When I could find games specifically Nokia, son suggested I try Sony-Erricson site since phones also use Symbian OS
 I find several games compatible Nokia E62 keyboard
Overall, great multifunction device
 

Beautiful phone plays wonderful video, easy read e-mail IF & WHEN works
 We bought 2 units spent significant amount time trying make work Outlook office give up
 Both way back Cingular
The Outlook client easy install sync happens almost instantly
 Calendar items, e-mail, contacts went elegantly
 Then stops working
 The client freezes trying sync
 Uninstall, reinstall


 luck
Video also stopped working
 Cingular said guarantees 3G phone work 3G
 I told technician worked beautifully 2 hours last night
 Cingular's official line NOT GUARNTEE works
 Too bad
 So much iTV
Joseph Ng 

The E62 great phone many good features MP3 ring tones, detailed phone book


Cingular edge data terrible, slow problems connecting server, even full single
 $39
00 month data excessive
 If additional $10-$15 one could live problems
I returned phone Cingular within trial period purchase 3G / WiFi E61 unlocked
 Lots good things near future 3G/Wi-Fi ability VOIP
 

This beautiful Smartphone sold bluetooth 2
0 Nokia's websites, not
 It older, slower bluetooth 1
2 network (though bluetooth 1
2 allows PDA like devices work phone)
Gorgeous smartphone plays MP3 AAC, mono using poor quality bluetooth wired headsets
 You CAN NOT hook decent stereo headphones (and I spent lot money trying)
 The ONLY headphones work stereo phone Nokia HS-47
 Also standard 2
5mm 3
5mm adapters work phone
 And ONLY 2
5mm 3
5mm adapter work bundled set external speakers (MD-4) Nokia cost 100 dollars
If never want listen music, use bluetooth handsfree headsets talking phone (not music listening phone support bluetooth stereo music spec part bluetooth 2
0 also have)
Very disappointed looking exchanging phone something else moment
 Possibly Samsung BLackjack
Nokia good reputation, lied advertising phone
 I feel good Phone, poor choice Smartphone
 

This weekend magical time every boy's life gets hit mobile phone store pick new toy
As long time Blackberry user, IT dude company, I thought duty, no, reason d'etre check Nokia E62 Cingular would allow get cheaper 'upgrade' price
I raced home eager finger new brightly lit high rez beautiful marvel engineering
 I amazed display, UI, controls, size, construction, even smell said "happy happy joy joy" I cracked open box
Getting connected company's Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) main concern, point old phone (Blackberry 7290) turned off, I without mail, no-no profession
Setting real Blackberry BES takes 2 clicks password, 10 minutes tops
 I hoping sort experience setting E62 Blackberry Connect, I sadly disapointed
First all, unlike real Blackberry, E62 requires special Blackberry Connect software installed PC, local Internet connection
 This anathema Blackberry user, depending PC dync data server
 This phone sexy, I began let little annoyances like slide
When I finally start connect BES server, software PC froze, required restarting Windows explorer
exe fix
 The next attempt locked phone up, required pulling battery reboot
 This I noticed Mini-SD card slot, battery cover
 Sort weird place it, again, phone sexy, overlooking problems
The E62 wound freezing several times weekend
 The OS slow respond
 Sometimes seconds button pushes action
 But phone pretty, sometime pretty important character flaws
I decided try Mail Exchange connection type, Exchange server work
 I thought would much easier using fake McBlackberry method, I gave shot
This method doesn't work either
 I cannot get past login screen, matter many permutations login credentials I give it
 Suddenly pretty isn't cutting it
I went Cingular forums searched E62
 I found _many_ people problems; OS freezes, Blackberry Exchange problems, etc
 Even get mail work, seems many hours week mail service doesn't work all, comes while, goes back down, etc
To fair, weren't (major) issues, device fantastic
 The MP3 playing, GPS client, display, construction, looks, feel, etc
 The speaker phone MP3 player loudspeaker sounded suprisingly bad
Like girl mentioned title review, phone nice body, looks beautiful, comes it, fun little while, cant accomplish anything useful it
Perhaps Nokia + Microsoft + RIM + Cingular work problems, I wouldn't expect fixes problems Christmas 2006
I returning unit Monday AM, asking Blackberry turned back on, I get back work
UPDATE:I would like point people love phone mention using Blackberry Connect Exchange For Mail (E4M)
 Of course phone work POP IMAP; device made last 10 years use POP/IMAP
 If using Blackberry used business mail done RIGHT handheld, E62 let big time
Check forums cingular
com
 People cannot get thing work BES Exchange servers
If wasnt fact single important aspect supposedly enerprise level handheld device didnt work well, would awesome phone
Yes, speakers sound amazing
Yes, media player nice
Yes, tons freaking bells whistles
No, replace Blackberry
 





































I use everyday, yet lost cell phone 
 


































































This holster-type cell phone clip great value
 They matched phone model exactly product sturdy construction
 It's nothing particularly sexy design like prefer type slimline approach pouches adhesive backed clips, provides excellent solution
 [


] 

What I like: Exactly fits phone
 Clips firmly belt
 Can't beat price
What I don't like: The holster rotates around clip, time, wear stay one position
I give five stars value money can't beat
 

The phone holster I recently received works fine Nokia 6101
 I one broke 7-8 months
 I hope one last longer
 

I love holster
 My phone never fall waist anymore, unlike old broken holster, phone constantly found floor
 My Nokia 6202 fits snugly holster clip holds well wherever I clipped it
 I charged $15
00 mall cellphone stand, good I didn't buy it
 

I totally disappointed holster
 I used week belt clip broke putting belt
 I guess get pay for
 

Everything I thought would be
 Seller delivered product earlier promised
 





















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































To anyone looking wireless service please investigate customers review AT&T
 Trust I say worth it
 The signal horrible well phones
 I find self turn phone back order get people hear I make receive call reason hear I cant hear happens often
 Another thing I barely use phone since I dont really like talking much phone still I get bills $100
00 I paying always problem needs resolved client service pain dealing every month
 Save self trouble lot research making contract AT&T cause wont let go unless pay large amount money leave
 I might pay since seem like charge monthly bill
 Good luck you
 



















Excellent price, excellent battery, extremely fast delivery
 I tell everyone I know uses Nokia 5100/6100 cell phone
 I talked numerous times today quite awhile
 The battery still shows full charge
 

I bought battery last year use everyday never charge It lite feel like dosen't even battery it
 Its like getting new phone thats best
 I love battery alot works like charm


 





















































































The Nokia N75, well designed clamshell phone great features, yet mediocre performance
 Nokia produced feature-packed phone suitable anyone likes eliminate extra gadgets hanging belt pockets
 You surf internet, play music, take pictures/videos, make to-do list much, much more
THE GOOD:The keypad large fat fingers, won't worry pressing wrong digit
 Bright vibrant colorful screen view even sunlight
 Well placed buttons front shell access mp3 files playback wired headset(you buy seperately) wireless bluetooth headset(also purchase seperately)
 Loud stereo speakers conversations relax tunes
 2 megapixel camera takes decent pictures videos, best quality would expect cell phone camera
THE BAD:Battery life extremely mediocre


 Even 4 5 bars signal strenght, expect charge phone daily basis never know battery die you
 You play game half hour hour you'll lose bar battery meter
 When low signal (1-3 bars), expect battery deteriote quickly
 Keep keypad locked, otherwise you'll music playing outer shell buttons pressed accidently
 AT&T; software slows phone, 90 days owning phone, call AT&T; unlock phone remove junk(google it, you'll know this)
CONCLUSION:The Nokia N75 feature-packed phone terrible battery life
 I wouldn't recommend buying phone unless get free, like I I signed AT&T
; I'm big Nokia fan phone put Nokia shame since I owned much better phones N73, N85, N95, 7610
 My favorite far N73 it's size it's well-packed features including 3
2 megapixel camera
 

I never liked nokia high response time takes every operation
 After three years I thought let give try I'm mistaken
 The phone features think like 3G,bluetooth,nice mp3 player, cool camera


but damn slow top batter life sucks


I recharge damn thing every single night I go bed else dead next day
(I talk around one hour per day keep bluetooth off)

Even opening call list takes around 2-3 seconds

 acceptable era
 

These perfectly cut fit exact size Nokia E62, takes effort apply protector, I bubbles screen won't go away matter I apply protector
 



Nice quality leather
 Keeps phone scratches
 You take picture without remove cover
 

I got I needed
 A small light case Nokia
 The case prevents phone chipping dropped happens alot
 
















This Phone Good enough But I several problems it:1
 first problem phone Russian Language it2
 The phone totally covered titanium
 The part plastic (black plastic) I didn't like it
 It described whole titanium little piece plastic seems beautiful
 Better sell describe images
 

I interested item, nokia 8800 sirocco gold
 I wonder Chinese product, item located? I buy original nokia 8800 sirocco, produced Nokia factory
 Is undamaged unused item? Is item, I want?Thanks 
















































































































































































































































































I purchased phone review phones offered T-Mobile
 It real, raised button keyboard, good display low radiation/SAR rating
 It makes received calls well
 The earpiece, small hole now, must positioned directly ear order hear well
 I suspect low volume complaints reported elsewhere related limitation
 The stubby antenna avoids hand contact contributes good call reception low radiation rating
The hands-free speaker works well, I hear hear phone lying desk leaving hands free
 The camera low pixel count zoom
 Didn't buy camera though
For basic phone, Nokia best I've found use T-Mobile, Motorola V195 high radiation/SAR flat keyboard flunks needs
 I buy leather case protect inevitable drops
 I hope Nokia 6103 gives service 5185i did
 

Owned phone 1 year, send back rocker button volume broke
 It made decent calls, HOWEVER BE CAREFUL OF THE FRONT SCREENS, THEY BREAK VERY EASILY
 I know couple people phone broke screens well
 

This great, easy use (as Nokia's usually are) phone
 Its also really durable, I pretty rough phones one made lot
 










































































































































































































































If I could rate NEGATIVE 5 stars, I would have
I ordered liking fact there's hook around ear
 When I opened box, even close what's pictured wasn't compatible phone
 I contacted seller said someone else sells unaware problem
 However



it's still shown Amazon
 Also, told would refund money, yet I haven't seen yet
 That month ago
I'm happy never order I suggest don't either
 

I bought product phone
 somehow I able make work
 It short range
 clear voice carry phone shirt Pocket
 It starts giving crackling sound even put hand it
 

I nokia 3555
 My phone can't find blue tooth
 Also I looked phone number call tech help, none
 

I dont use device often since dont use phone much really mean much me
 The device worked reception clear I did
 It comfortable also
 










































I looking good set headphones fit way use 2
5mm jack pocket pc
 The volume sound low even highest setting I return them
 It possible work well Nokia phone
 I Nokia phone testged that
 I don't care much skull picture side either - little morbid
 

Love case
 It looks like "million bucks" protective, however, main thing use 8125 phone constantly case frustrating
 It difficult get time answer call
 Otherwise, strong functional several ways hang belt put pocket
 




Bought I hoped would save new no-phone driving laws
 Problem (a) battery life non-existent - seems last 15 30 minutes best, (b) buttons small - hard know it's on/off, let alone alter volume, (c) hard get clips - I tried sizes - ears consistently, (d) clips infuriating - talking abuse - put glovebox jacket, next time look clips broken - everytime place - Nokia designed lemon, producing workable, comfortable clip salvage appalling product here
 My supplier (not Amazon) doesn't want know and, add insult injury - &quot;solution&quot; new clips doesn't work
 They're always stock
 Never, ever, ever buy product - I would even pay dollar it
 

&quot;Nobody expects Spanish Inquisition


&quot; especially headset
 First Rack
 Then Iron Maiden
 Now it's Nokia headset
 Painful wear, even single call
 The headset loops two sizes reviews state- &quot;left&quot; &quot;right&quot; - loop use depends ear wish wear headset over
 Both small ear except perhaps found small Asian man American child
 No padding loop earpiece all
 Just hard plastic
 Pressed ear
Setup breeze - took entire 2 minutes
The Bluetooth connection drops sometimes calls ended
 Yea, I use headset, often I used old Jabra headset last phone
 The Jabra original model, would work phone (a fact Jabra site skips
) The Jabra much comfortable, I thought compatibility issue Jabra - older vs newer Jabra headset, I ordered Nokia
The Nokia NOT include charger - need use phone charger
 Handy I use car charger home charger
 Not handy phone charging
 It's cool access last number dialed, voice dial, answer call headset, limited battery life disappointment
 

Consistent reviews HDW-2, plastic ear loop break matter well care it
 Until Nokia redesigns part and/or improves customer service, I would strongly recommend purchasing HDW-2
 Calling Nokia customer service frustrating since consumer pays return original defective parts must wait replacement
 Clearly Nokia unwilling directly address problem
 Otherwise performance HDW-2 fair
 Reception reasonably good intermittent static
 Occasionally, phone HDW-2 lose connection apparent reason
 

I used unit couple months Nokia 6310i phone would like share experience
First all, ear hanger fragile needs treated care
 If follow instructions problems
 However, careful handle unit using something simple placing coat shirt pocket could break hanger unit bumped twisted pocket
Seoondly, battery life near Nokia claims
 I tend get 24-30 hours standby usually less 1 hour talk time
 I charged unit called Nokia tech support less 15 minutes headset giving low battery warning
 It charged back full less 5 minutes
 Clearly problem either unit, design
If considering unit due Nokia's reputation may want look bluetooth headsets purchase model
 On hand unit works great works, keep charger nearby times
 

I recently reviewed Nokia 3650 phone would remiss say anything 1st accessory I purchased , headset
 I went Nokia's website purchase item stock I oreder Japanese/Asian version shop specializes cell phone accessories
 Like reviewers said breeze set 3650
 I think took 3 mins
 I I consider, regular size ears headset comfy brief uses
 I wear ride work (a 20-30 mins trip)
 Its light lot smaller would think looking photos
 It reception range great
 I usually keep phone glovebox car headset ear
 The range 20-30 ft signalk get bad 40 ft signal breaks off
 That means I (if I right parking spot) get cae , walk dunkin donuts coffee stop newspaper box get back car without loosing signal I several morinngs way work
 Calls answered ended vol raised lowered headset
 For price I paid (


) item I think worth it
 It lost one star battery cover seems kinds flimsy comes I put unit pocket change /or keys there
 Also forgot mention phone recarger also recharges headset 
 

A little bit expensive bluetooth headsets market, it's best
 I spent days research one Nokia 3650, got Jabra BT200, didn't work (Jabra says older version doesn't support Nokia 3650)
 Then I decided I really stick Nokia
I hesitated beginning I didn't like color scheme, I got it
 It much much smaller lighter I expected
 I realized I don't really look like someone wearing big gold earring I thought I would be
It works Nokia 3650 like charm
 I read reviews saying ear loop/ring tends break, I guess I wait see
 It look little bit fragile
The 1 star doesn't get color scheme seems-to-be-fragile ear loop
 

The sound quality headset wasn't I expected
 It wasn't always reliable establishing connection phone
 The &quot;earhook&quot; hurt ear (and yes, I tried sizes)
 I returned it
 

Not happy purchase
 I send back
I'm heavy cell-phone user; I'm sales road lot
 I really rely phone
 I liked idea Nokia hand-set (6310i) Nokia bluetooth headset
- Poor design: ear-piece painful wear long periods time, ear-loop broke third day, power &amp; volume buttons small difficult use- Battery life: batter lasted MAYBE hour talk-time
 It would beep times, go dead
 Once didn't beep died middle call
- Dropped connection: pair relationship would intermittently drop
 I've seen comment others specifically related HDW-2, comparable Jabra product
 I wonder may Nokia handset thing
In short, I disappointed purchase
 I think I'll give Jabra shot
 The consensus Jabra seems positive
 

It's breeze setup headset work Nokia 3650 design poor it's worth buying many well designed sets
The 'earhook' hurts, delicate I broke larger one
 The small one fits infants
 The engineer designed 'earhook' must tiny ears
 I used super glue stick keeps breaking every day
 I able find one selling extra large size spare one
 So, I need design something works me
Functionally, it's great works fine loud clear
 You control volume headset answer call headset
 Also, use charger used phone
 If 'tiny' ears go it
 

Here direct comparison Jabra 250:Set Nokia Jabra easy - I able pair easily per instructions within couple minutes
The Nokia head set disconnects phone frequently (about 10 times day)
 Almost every time I connect, disconnects within half hour (sometimes couple minutes)
 This annoying specially driving I don't know connected phone rings
 The Jabra headset never disconnected
The Jabra headset still comfortable - problems wearing extended periods
 With Nokia, ear would start hurting within 15 minutes wearing it
The Jabra stays place securely
 The Nokia always felt like fall off
 It also started moving around I wearing since clip became loose (where headset attaches clip) week
 The clip never fit correctly ear (both sizes), edges clip sharp
 Eventually clip broke
The sound quality Jabra far superior Nokia
 People end phone can't tell I head set using Jabra
 With Nokia sound tinny, muffled ends
Battery life Jabra much (5x) longer Nokia
 

I bought headset specifically apprently 3650 doesn't play well bluetooth accessories, one says compatable
 Well, isnt
 I could never get pair phone
 I know bluetooth works phone I connect computer regularly
After talking Nokia, said &quot;firmware&quot; phone old version, headset wouldn't work phone all
 Be wary buying headset
 




































































This handsfree kit nice, NOT support Bluetooth Hands-free profile - ONLY Bluetooth Headset
So ignore fact listing written someone doesn't know they're talking about, read on
Many Bluetooth headsets look really weird
 If want exceptional voice quality ease use traditional look headset, simply cannot go wrong device
 It works quite well, I used extensively many months Sony Ericsson T68i Nokia 6310i
I wish went little louder, I wish clip useful
 The neck-strap best way wear thing
 Maybe shirts don't enough stiffness them, tends pull corner pretty easily clamp on
 

unit support ALL nokia S60 phones (3600, 3620, 3650, 3660, 6600, 6620, 6630, 7610, n-gage, n-gage qd)any phone users models DO NOT buy producthowever, works really good nokia 6820 




























































So seeing phone online I HAD it
 I'm grungy rock girl
 I don't wear expensive jewlery, I drive used Corolla, I wanted something nice, I bought phone celcom_inc ebay got it
 First impression review:It's sooooo pretty, although pretty white screensaver always shows ads available
 Huh? Also b/c really shiny, smudges easily
 Its small swivel phone, I've messing around functions
 Pretty easy navigate settings features, couple decent ringtones come phone
 The camera phone is

well camera phone
 Nothing great, work I dont wanna drag digital around
 The radio little annoying first try get 2 radio stations I wanted, program I'm sure I'll get hang it
So super shallow want really cool looking phone doesnt take tech nerdlinger figure fits small purse pocket, dudes, phone totally wins beauty pageant
PS: I also saw 7360 store, thing aint slouch either
 They basically features found less money
 Or wait till phone doesn't cost $300


 

One person's long winded opinion Amber 7370
About Phone Itself:I ordered phone another merchant last week
 When came I excited; everything I expected be
 It cute I received many compliments it
 There people actually asked was
 =)The phone sturdy I don't think falling average person's pocket hands onto ground would much damage
 The twist feature phone unique didn't take much time get used it
 The size screen great; I think it's much larger phones incredible considering size one
 The back phone Nokia describes faux-leather adds nice little contrast
The sound level phone average ringtone volume good different levels it
 It vibrate feature well
This phone bluetooth also fantastic downloading themes ringtones made downloaded others
The phone arrived text, multimedia internet settings T-Mobile easily fixed Nokia's website
 If search phone page section downloads send information service provider directly phone text message
 All open message settings put in, piece cake
There also 1
3 megapixel camera pretty cool
 If large fingers though plan rough time hitting button actually take pictures
 I don't abnormally large hands I struggling push button correctly
 That also goes power button side phone
 It small looks like something need search paper clip pen tip depress
 I able successfully accomplish two tasks I see may issue some
About Bands:I didn't know much "bands" difference "tri-band" "quad-band" (that means there's one more, right? *smiling blankly*) I received started using it
 This phone tri-band missing 850
 I would full signal one second, nothing next calls dropped every minutes
 After research I came realization phone missing 850 band Cingular uses (around area anyway &lt;Cape Cod>)
As I said before, phone came settings T-Mobile installed I'm pretty sure would work wonderfully service
 I can't say anything brands service it's definitly worth call company find out
The Good:~ Stylish~ Sturdy~ 1
3 Megapixel camera~ Bluetooth~ Large viewing screenThe Bad:~ No 850 band~ Very small buttons power cameraIf phone worked service I would happy probably wouldn't part it
 There definitly phones bells whistles chances good you're looking phone style
 

First problem: Phone kept refusing read SIM card, eventually place small piece paper battery card hold securely enough
 Second problem: one month use applications began freezing dropping calls
 Had turn even use it
 What Nokia say? "Sorry
" DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS EVEN THOUGH IT IS PRETTY



 

This phone beautiful
 I love everything way looks
 It smaller I'd expected doesn't bother least
I agree w/ one reviewers -- reception volume could better
 And could well I wish screen would light I swivel open
I love phone
 

I like nokia 7370
 It looks great pretty reliable
 The two things Nokia could improve would volume reception
 Rather phone awesome I would recommend anyone would like fashion peace pocket
 

This vendor charge goods send, ignore complaints 

 STAY AWAY OR LOSE YOUR MONEY
 

Product came damaged
 Packaging damaged, product description semi-accurate however product compatible use UNITED STATES
 Phone would cut features service would work
 Return process nightmare
 I returned product immediately exchange & never received new product, attempted contact seller multiple times person reached
 After 2 months finally received refund purchase price only
 































































































































































































































































































































































































The product arrived time frame promised
 It easy use worked description said would
 














































































































































Very nice item, I preferred form factor new stand
 BUT please note, 6680 series phone wide stand
 




























Not cable connector allow seamless notebook dial capabilities, phone cable also used HP Jornada 548 using serial port cable, comes Jornada
 This allows compact flash socket remain free
 This leaves room memory card handle large downloads
 Lets see Palm Device handle multi-meg download
 This cable makes possible
 With greater amount airtime included cell phone plans cable makes lot $ sense mobile service like ricochet 

The cable works well, WAP limited digital areas only
 The Nokia phones capability transfer data analog networks
 We worked Nokia Corporate well several carriers success convert phone work analog
The side cannot use data cable phone hands free cradle (mobile)
 This real disadvantage field work
We still use 3-watt analog cellular phones low speed data (14
4) transfer (180 units harder find, although "On Star Network" uses old Motorola 3-watt systems) well satellite systems (16 units) high speed data (near T-1)
 The new "flat rate" satellite programs replaced "per minute" plans, equipment costs still high, around [a lot money] per unit auto-deploy / auto tracking dish system
Overall Nokia good phone years
 Better signal lock Motorola, although still use Motorola two-way radios
 We still wish 3-watt phone would come back, new technology
 We use commercial / MILSPEC 3-watt analog phones vendor, special arrangements carrier services
 










I bought phone use I travel Europe
 I've pleased experience thus far
 It's true device devours battery - make sure you're prepared charge every night, buy second battery
 My favorite feature phone set vibrate ring time - probably sucks battery life, I'm less likely miss call way
 I wish LG could this
This device comes UK-native plug US adapter
 

This far best phone I ever used
 True Nokia's reputation voice quality fantastic
 This phone many features I can't imagine wanting anything else - name connectivity it, name option, it's there
 If want small, light, pseudo PDA phone, push talk calendaring light email it, add seamless global usage I say



 

I abused Nokia 6131 beyond belief still works
 I amazed
 I actually accidentally put mine clothes dryer jacket I realized 20 minutes later
 When took out, fell cement tumbled couple feet away
 It came piping hot smelling like dryer sheets, I amazed find still working perfectly


 Seriously, it's amazing
The thing bugs battery life, isn't great all
 I don't remember like dryer fiasco, I imagine battery life much much shorter I accident
 I'd buy phone I chance, I know it's built last
 

I got phone 3-4 days ago amazing
 Let tell you, completely customizable, quickly easily used bluetooth capabilities pair computer, could even access phone info via windows explorer I installed free nokia software downloaded website
 The screen resolution excellent, everything I could possibly want, believe I picky


 you're picky hate buyers remorse, trust me, go phone wont disappointed
 

Recently I've got new Nokia 6131
 The phone great
 I've using Nokia 6230 best feature I loved editable Voice Tags whle driving press button Bluetooth device, say name Contact List (previously recorded yourself), phone recognising voice dialing desired party
 Very convinient
 But Nokia 6131 comes prerecorded names tags every contact you're entering good doesn't work case
 Different voice prononciation times you're getting someone else instead calling it's name Bluetooth
 I can't understand idea this
The thing(was described previous reviews) battery doesn't stay longer 2 days needs recharged
The idea Nokia 6131 amazing, beautiful design etc
 I think Nokia recall product repair 2 items
 

I love phone
 I love phone much I'm third one
 No nothing wrong previous two went swim ocean - I work boat it's hazard job
 I always liked Nokia ease use, rarely I pick manual find function phone
 I digressed slightly 'hand-me-down' Sony Ericsson couple years simply wouldn't break - although I hated layout menu functions I didn't want spend unneccessary money new phone
 I eventually managed wear keypad good enough excuse return first love - Nokia
I say downside phone robustness - lack - exterior finish
 I problems matt black finish delaminating & often first thing get damaged mini screen - gets scratched easily
 If handle phone anything pristine - face - become months extremely happy stylish, compact generally cool phone
The bonus particular version relatively good price unlocked phone - familiar understand
 Plus Quadband means usable practically anywhere - even outer islands Bahamas still use antiquated TDMA system
Enjoy
 

good things read others reviews absolutely right
big botons dial, great reception, push open boton, terrific display, extremely well designed menu, easy intuitive use


simplythe best cell phone I've ever had
that's something regret buy


 

This good phone
 Many complaints I read phone true
 The camera button really thought side
 I many pictures pocket
 The volume adjustment little funky
 But overall it's great little phone
Hope helps
 

After using previous cell phone long time I knew going challenge find one I would like
 This phone disappoint
 I sent back Motorola slvr I originally ordered exchanged one, regrets
First 'soft-touch' paint feels great hands leathery touch back helps grip phone batter
 It certainly feel like better quality materials hands
 The flip-to-open button works nice
 I've never seen phone it's damn handy
The keypad nice big it's easy dial text
 The nice big display screen helps too
The menus interface great
 It's simple pleasant use, main reason I switched Motorola
 Some options unusually list phone menus I got around quick
 Voice reception signal great ring volume speaker plenty loud enough
The camera little grainy low light, otherwise fine, assign images contacts wallpaper
 This phone customizable
The camera button outside accidentally pushed, though honest need lot stuff tightly packet pocket happen
 It hasn't happened yet
 I haven't owned phone long enough say battery life yet, though I see might drain battery life mini-outer screen well
Overall great phone
 If want phone 'ease use' I would highly recommend it
 

I owned phone less two months problems it
 The first problem terrible battery life followed signal
 (even standing cell site) I finally sent repair
 It came back note claiming econimical repair warranty void siting corrosion
 In short two months I never corossive environment
 I since learned people problem Nokia's failure honor warranty
 

I owned phone year half still works great
 When got it, thought flip button opening would break days, but, yes, lasted
 Its one thing sets phone apart other
 I mainly used phone taking pics vids



i baby caught entire first year phone, dev lot pics quality amazing
 I even take vids problem need first download 3pg player order play comp


also, sent vids email, need certain person u emailed also 3gp player downloaded, otherwise wont work
I also use MP3 phone lot


the sound clear speakers loud enough heard jogging park runnin treadmill home (meaning decide use headphones
)Another great thing phone durability
 It gone thick thin (a lot drooling son plays it


) yet held up
I really recommend phone anyone needs functional phone last doesnt confuse you
 

This phone quite nice, easy use, keyboard great
 However, two things really annoy - screen gets dirty disgusting
 And - get - phone dials own
 The thing goes phone book randomly calls people, sitting purse
 I tried discussing t-mobile issue, looks like replace phone itself
 Very-very annoying, mention embarrassing
 

I'm long-time fan Nokias never purchased clamshell-style phone them; like form factors phone well-built, easy-to-use, performs functions speed & ease
 A high points particular model:- fantastic screens, inside & out- great feel keypad & nice case texture- 'flip-open' button excellent- signal battery quality are, per normal Nokia standards, superb 

Very happy phone
 I using unlocked 6102i prior one excellent phone well
 The 6131 makes great calls I Cingular
Beautiful internal screen, big buttons neat rubbery finish outside
 Unique design, press button phone opens up
 I really think feature cool
The 1
3 mp camera 8x zoom takes excellent pictures, especially used using VGA zoom
 The micro sd card, another excellent addition
 I used taking 5 6 pics run memory start deleting pics
 I bought 1 gig card memory problems
Great FM radio along mp3 player
 I already Nokia stereo headset needed FM radio 6102i works perfectly 6131
 I transferred 150 mbs music via bluetooth phone PC
 Works great
 I listen speaker listen bluetooth headset
 Speaking bluetooth, phone problem pairing bluetooth devices
 Speakerphone great phone calls well using bluetooth
Edge technology plenty fast internet browsing
 As unlocked phone spend hours first day getting downloads Nokia, googling, tweaking settings, etc
 get internet, MMS, text messaging, email, etc
 working
 But easy done, it's done
Now bad thing is, yep, battery life, bad
 Consider lucky go whole day without charging
 It really depends much surf internet keeping beautiful power robbing internal screen lit up
 Luckily 6131 uses battery 6102i I total 3 batteries I keep charged switch needed
All all, best Nokia I owned date
 Every Nokia I buy better last
 You won't regret buying phone
 Just grab extra battery ebay
 You set
 

I bought 6131 Wife, came like 2 months use
 Nokia's web site said I upgrade operating software improve certain features
 This worked great N73, went 6131
 Part way upgrade process computer lost touch phone, point phone dead
 I returned phone Nokia phone two months four I owned it, I cannot get responses customer service/repair expected return me
 Just hope never use Nokia customer support
 

I cell phone since May 8th
 year I think tricky good fashions, example world wathc, fast acces someoptions, best tremendous 8X zoom camera lens aditional digital zoom take picture
 I photography aficionado 20 years, I think feature wonderfull, Canon 28-105 lens 3
75X
 On hand poor batery life mortal phone: take pictures, make calls, look pictures battery death
 For worst charger take full two half hours charge battery again; previous Nokia 3220 one half hour
 Vicente Cardone, Barranquilla, Colombia
 

I think great
 The problem I learning use options phone offer
 Great phone
 

Big fan, I avid LG guy I switched Nokia 6102 (not bad phone except I destroyed it)
 I wanted go get something MP3 player Bluetooth I could guy headset supermarket like I asking Scotty power
 Anyway, lowdown:Pros:-Compact: much thinner old 6102-Bluetooth range excellent, I gone 20-25 feet still headset work: I Sony Ericcson HBH PV700
-Display excellent-Large numbers keypad great dialing: small phones tiny buttons fat fingers can't manage
Cons:-The new Nokia voice dial thing, automatically assigns voice name, can;t record like old days
 It bit rough needs work
Another note: I use cingular, go Nokia website download settings get internet, MediaNet, etc work
 Make sure go site say Europe since phone US yet
 You'll find info support section, send text phone updates everything
Over all, great phone
 Probably favorite yet, price get options $400 phones
 Haven't used MP3 player yet, can;t say much that
 

I ordered phone Amazon though supplier Ace Photo & Digital
 I'm happy phone - Nokia best cellular device manufacturer mind
 Sound great flip works awesome
 However experience Ace terrible
 The phone came mal-functioning charger missing Micro SD card
 My whole interaction fiasco
 If possible find another vendor
 Here pros cons phone:Pros:1
 Great sound user interface2
 High quality materials - looks feels robust3
 Large buttons4
 High quality screen5
 Blue tooth works greatCons:1
 Side camera button keeps pushed mistakengly - turning camera I don't really want on
 This somewhat annoying
 

Wonderful Phone, know it's nokia means getting great phone, I think need work improve battery life duration
 As well, night pictures could improved
I recommend it
 

I'm extremely happy phone
 I owned almost month now
 The menus responsive display crystal clear high definition colors
 The "free" RAZR came plan still sitting box -- doesn't compare
I added 1GB memory using SD micro flash
 So definitely used mp3 player
 But would need get NOKIA -> headphone adapter plug third party vendor
 Or use speaker phone pinch
The camera takes great pictures long lighting conditions good
 The menus many options customizing phone (though options somewhat hidden casual user menu tree)
The speaker independent voice recognition seems pull correct name time give several choose cases
I really like flip phone button opens phone, open one hand
 It works reliably spring right tension
The keypad lit easy see darkness
 Due high contrast brightness display seems consume battery power
 On standby phone many days used, otherwise would need charge every day use features keeps display turned long periods time (editing notes/organizer etc
)
Some nice features:-Todo lists-Notes-Calendar-Various kinds reminders (with reminders set event)-The next item calendar today shown main screen bottom
-MP3 player / w/equalizer-Radio (need use headphones (which also works antenna))-Black almost rubber-like finish easy grip scratch easily
-Simple userfriendly menus keypad (the phone I purchased branded preprogrammed "buy ringtones/wallpaper" buttons etc
-Great voice quality-Sych phone numbers/appointments via bluetooth/IrDA/cableHighly recomended

Ok, nokia 6131 I must say phone I like call "sleeper
" It look like much, You go use it, different story
 First off, camera cool
 I issues using low light situations, pics become grainy, cool
 The push button flip works would expect too
 In regards computer compatibility, I heavy Mac User
 According Apple, phone suppose compatible, easy fiix
 Allowing syncing contact info
 calanders
 In regards menus, responsive, quick
 The internal external display extreamly high quality, crisp
 For bluetooth compatability, I issues
 I previously owned RAZR bluetooth options, phone blows old razr water
 You option uploading new themes (which easy find make) upload ringtones, pics, ever
 And data transfer much quicker RAZR
 I would highly recommend phone user
 It far best phone I used
Pros: High res
 screens, quickness menus, BT, Camera, push button flip, speaker loud
Cons: Unlocked Europe comes bulky euro charger (not big deal
) And thing I would say battery life somthing desired
 I use BT allot I end charge phone every one two days
 

This great everyday use phone
 It doesn't bells whistles newer Nokia phones, like integrated WiFi (with VoIP integration) GPS, well designed do
 I use phone T-Mobile unlimited Internet plan (using EDGE)
Pros:The build quality materials chosen top notch
 The plastic cover doesn't look feel cheap, like many (some expensive) phones there
 I like fine leathery touch battery cover, provides good grip phone hand
The internal screen large, plenty pixels colors
 Most apps look well
 With Google Maps example it's easy read discern details
The phone' sound quality superb
 The earpiece clear, microphone voice processing hardware inside phone makes side hear clearly
 The loudspeaker fairly good too, although I'm using often
The Bluetooth software stack perfectly compatible
 My car's Bluetooth implementation picky works handful selected phones
 The Nokia 6131 phone listed compatible phone BMW M3, works fine it, fancier expensive Nokia N80ie phone not
The included radio pretty cool you're bored, although requires included proprietary headset work (it uses antena)
Google Maps GMail work excellent phone
 They don't come device, they're download away Google
The phone's camera fairly decent job well lit shots
 It also takes videos, pretty cool phone
 Just don't expect camera replace point shoot DSLR
The ability use MP3s regular ring tones huge bonus
 No buying ridiculously expensive ring tones phone company, already music
 Just take song want, edit 30 second portion suitable ring tone, convert MP3 upload phone
 You could assign different ring tones different people, recognize who's calling you
The phone MacOS X compatibility, latest 10
4
9 release
 It synchronizes address book Bluetooth without problems, including people's pictures
 When somebody calls you, his/her picture appears external display
 The picture scaled however, making look bit ugly
 I guess Apple needs allow higher resolution pictures set AddressBook
Cons:As many Nokia phones, phone cannot use regular headset, works proprietary Nokia headset
 This understandable, headset stereo, doubles antenna
 It would nice however extra plug regular headsets
The package include MicroSD card
 Not bad, quite cheap, aware decide buy phone
The camera shutter button side, it's easy press accidentally phone pocket
Setting T-mobile Internet phone could pain
 You could find instructions online googling bit, it's smooth "just works" experience N80ie
--Overall, I think great phone everyday use
 It replacing aging Motorola phone, far it's refreshing change
 I highly recommend phone
 

I didn't realize size buttons I got it, I big fingers it's difficult use telephone tiny buttons, one, problem solved, big buttons, big screen, big memory
Very good camera resolution, 1
3 M, I think enough Cell Phone want quality pictures use Camera
The screen resolution incredible
The FM radio, Bluetooth, IR MP3 valuables telephone
I neever saw telephone "open flip button" comfortable, helps open one hand
The problem, camera button outside activate accidentaly
 

I've used Nokia 6131 phone 2 months, great feature set I initially thought it'd good phone - beware reviews posted days use
Battery life abysmal
 With bluetooth, etc
 enabled, initially I getting 1
5 days useful life
 After 2 months, bluetooth disabled power saving features set phone won't last 24 hrs charges
The phone work dead battery even plugged charger
 You must wait battery sufficient charge phone used
 And charge time slow - charging driving 45 min daily get keep phone fully charged
 You'll need plug charger every night
Unlike phones phone charge connected via USB cable
 And USB cable proprietary - cannot use standard mini-USB
The Nokia-proprietary stereo headset left earbud stopped working 2 weeks
 The radio mp3 player support bluetooth headset (mine mono - sure stereo bluetooth headset would work)
 So me, NPR audiobook MP3s bluetooth headset
The lid phone presses "0" button little pressure applied
 Take pocket you'll clear "000000000"'s dialing
 Oh yeah - 0's also took phone power-saving sleep mode consumed valuable battery life using it
The flip-button neat I handed phone friend call home, didn't tell button opened without button - crack, cheap-o latch broke
 It designed work ok button-uninitiated
I've great success Nokia phones one failure
 I expect they'll get flip phones right point I'll using another brand then
 

This high quality phone, excellent voice quality
 Battery life great
The camera video features work exceptionally well
My quibble camera button easily pushed phone pocket
 

pretty good phone
the good:large inner outer screens

7 million colors pretty coolloud ringtones speakerphonelarge keypad nice white backlightthe push flip great

I love phone nice screen quality comfortable feel inyour hands 1
3 meg camera picture quality great
 drawback battery life nokia needs release anew improve battery enjoying phone appeals friends 

My girlfriend bought phone 2 months ago, day one complained battery life
 I thought exaggerating got sick ditched favour older nokia
 Just yesterday I decided I'd try 6131 myself, I'm partial new gadgets
I started day fully charged battery
 By 1pm, total 30/40 minutes phone calls 5 6 SMS messages sent received, along 10 minutes playing Sudoku, battery showing quarter full life
 I need phone day, I promptly switched back Sony Ericsson K750i
The *appalling* battery life phone renders almost unusable day day phone
 I'm surprised phone ever got released production Nokia
 Generally I'm Nokia fan- I like user interfaces, although I bit less gone phone design general
 But particular model failure opinion
Other bugbears phone:No micro SD card included standard
 Just seems bit cheap me
Camera button side phone easily activated phone pocket, draining battery even quickly
Non-intuitive interface times, e
g
 sending messages scroll 3 items access contacts
 Not deal-breaker, annoying niggle present last NokiaPositive points:Quite nice clamshell design
Easy use, big keys 

This phone exactly I looking for
 The menu easy use function keys simple
 The quality pictures also good
 I motorola cellphones switched Nokia battery motorola died
 This supposed temporary move, I fell love much Nokia's ease use I decided get higher end Nokia phone
 I pleased purchase continue purchase Nokia's lines
 

This phone crazy
 full features, features could want mid range phone
 The display absolutely gorgeous
 The drawback picture quality could little bit better
 Overall great buy
 The clarity crystal clear signal excellent
 

This one best Nokia phones, I owned
 The design great, camera big enough excellent photos may go menus long time
 The price also good overall I pleased it
 Highly recommended

I need basic features pretty good


have played around contact informations yet (name directory), doubt I might slight disappointed I search names entering first character name ? ideas case ? 

I looking good phone want expend much I made right choice
 I happy phone, easy use blue tooth compatibility great
 The camera powerful works great easy fast use
 It best phone I ever had
 

Very good cell phone
if want get something everything expenda reasonable ammount money good option
 





































































































































Fit nicelly device gives nice color set
The buttons must pressed strengh
 

I received yesterday, I charged full capacity then
 It hasn't gone yet, I've using lot today
 My original battery would've halfway now
 So, works really well
 I highly recommend it
 

I surprised inexpensive replace old battery, lost lot ability hold charge, also starting bulge ominously
The new battery arrived mail box days, slipped right old phone made work like new again
 Now I don't need re-charge every single day, literally talk hours without running battery down
 

The original battery held charge almost week
 This supplier claimining holding 1 day average battery phone
 Not so
 I hope respond concern better response that
 

Save money
 This battery absolutely NOT worth price


for matter worth anything
 Does hold charge 12 hours
 I better original Nokia battery hold charge least 24 hrs
 I recommend item
 

I've got battery I'm really happy now
 My cell phone work without charging 3 days
 Yes, I don't talk lot anyway
Good thing
 

I don't know battery better one I took phone
 It suffices
 I decided try generic purpose
 I figured first all, would counterfeit generic product
 Second, cheapest, still nominal cost
 The delivered promised I got new charger go literally pennies
 Does job, incredibly cheap, can't complain 

THE BEST WAY TO BUY A REPLACEMENT BATTERY FOR YOUR PHONE
 I DON`T THINK I WILL BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM A STORE
 YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST
T

 F
 N
CANDYMANKIRK 

I find product helpful
 It didn't hold charge, maybe I looking I thought real battery
 

It holds charge like original battery new
 It fits phone like OEM battery did, too
 

Got expected delivery days
 Works 2 days cellphone standby
 



I thought I wouldn't able find matching cell phone clip Nokia anywhere exhausting malls Radio Shack
 So I delighted find vendor incredibly low price, delivery 3 days faster promised
 I completely happy entire transaction
 

For price great maybe order dozen keep reserve
 I mine month two phone/clip got caught jacket clip snapped off
 Otherwise worked well kept phone belt
 Can't beat price
 

I couldn't believe price
 All I paid shipping, like $3
50 (super slow speed


It took 1 week)
 I broken 5 holsters different styles brands cell phone usage
 They usually tend break getting cars
 I tell looking short life span

 For right thing working great





Hence 4 stars
Edit: As predicted thing shattered less 3 months climbing front seat car
 Oh well, live learn
 




























case made nice but


 small 7250 Blackberry 









































I great expectations hands-free car kit, microphone unreliable
 The speaker comes loud clear, microphone works sporadically
 I'm going take back
 Perhaps it's fluke
 Additionally, I want phone time previously bought leather, glove-fit carrying case swivel belt clip, hands-free holder doesn't allow room fit phone case on
 I jump car frequently don't want mess putting/taking leather carrying case on/off time, consequently I can't use hands-free holder
 I think could designed tad wider stronger gripping mechanism accommodated leather carrying case well
 

I bought mom extra charger phone always ends dying forgets take charger her
 It worked well phone
 

As long phone compatible, pretty good charger
 It works, doesn't get hot OEM charger came mother's phone (as technically inclined, I tech repairs/ordering)
 I impressed quality price
 


This case provides excellent protection fits remarkably well
 I got case shortly purchasing phone haven't take yet
 All cut outs black case perfectly located charge, connect usb, operate lens cover, use speakerphone without interference case
Curious material - it's odorless, soft slightly tacky
 Whatever is, dimensionally stable quality, durable feel
 The two parts slide smoothly
 Great product
 

Bought case, paid premium price thinking quality product compared cheap ones available ebay
 When I received package, I dead disappointed
 The slider mechanism case seems glued silicon case, one side torn off
 I would assume would check ship
 Shipping covered even return exchange
 It like paying mistakes
What's worse, case loose fitting extremely poor fit
 Contacted customer service, 3 days still response them
 I guess last time I ever buy anything them
 













































I've using phone month really impressed
It's small flip phone, easy open/shut one hand, importantly, reception better work basement apartment Motorola V360 I first bought
 The external antenna good thing
Speakerphone audio quality good, noise level high enough
The radio reception could better, really want radio, get iPod :-) It cool listen to, remember need earpiece attached won't play (the earpiece attachment acts radio antenna)
Menus pretty easy navigate, customize main screen shortcuts
 You also customize background ring tones, though built-in ringtones *very* compared phones
T-Mobile still working new themes - phone comes 3 I'm stickler personalizing phones backgrounds, patterns, etc
One thing I really like: You screen saver slide show images
 Very nice :)The Camera & Video capture work well, decent picture quality
 There even "Night Mode" low light
The ONLY thing I dont like: NO CALL TIMER call
 All see summary afterwards
 Thats I didn't give phone 5
But all, good buy (esp new/renewed service)
 

From former Nokia 3650 (Series 60) user, phone upgrade downgrade
 It play Java games sent via bluetooth designed it, cannot run Java programs use bluetooth stack (eg
 Sailing Clicker)Regarding previous reviewer's comment lacking custom ringtones different callers, phone DOES allow custom ringtones groups
 Thus, put individual group
As picky build quality details, it's better Motorolas & Samsungs, "built like tank" previous Nokias
 The buttons tactile, flip strong stays shut
 There defect (at least phone) left softkey physically clicks, register keypress
 A stronger depression register keypress
The ~4MB available memory enough users
 The signal level equal slightly better Motorazr & Samsung's phones
 There seems less bars (3/4 versus 5/5 house) 3650, although actual usage shows call quality signal strength good 850MHz 1900MHz service areas
 It definitely beats non-850MHz capable phone roaming T-Mobile USA
 The vibrate seems passably strong, better average
 iSync bluetooth great, lacks contact picture sync'ing found phones
 The screens transreflective thus quite easy read daylight, even without using backlight
Die hard GSM junkies miss essential SIM card features able set "slot" contact stored card, speed dial
 SIM card speed dial (eg
 dialing 100# slot 100) usable, displays contact's number, name
 Voice dialing quite accurate, substitute SIM speed dial
Summary: Methadone Nokia user seeking clam-shell phone
 

I think Nokia makes great phones, reliable durable
 My last phone Nokia 6610 I 2
5 years
 While friends Motorolas Samsungs shell another $200 every year phones would break




 If you've Nokia before, menus/features similar pretty much
 This one extras: camera/video Bluetooth
 Had phone 2 weeks
 Here's I've observed thus far:1
 Camera: takes good pictures, well know, camera phone anyway2
 Bluetooth: I don't BT headset yet I used Bluetooth (along Bluetooth USB adapter PC) sync PC using Nokia PC Suite
 This handy came time switch phone numbers old phone new one
 As may know, save numbers SIM card saves 1:1 relationship, meaning 1 phone number per name
 Yes pain reorganize phone numbers contact name, however, much easier PC
3
 Also - someone commented review pictures contacts
 You cannot utilize full functionality phonebook u r using SIM card only
 You need save numbers phone memory directly
 SIM card memory numbers really used r switching phones
4
 Data cable: I bought CA-42 blue data cable
 The phone recognizes won't connect Nokia PC Suite software
 Not sure cable software, although software low tech temperamental
5
 Infrared IR port: again, I tried connect phone PC using IR
 My PC recognized phone there, alas, Nokia PC Suite software would connect, bast*rd
6
 Softkeys: phone 5 6 soft keys, meaning edit keys whichever menu function want use there
 Someone previously posted couldn't make phone go Silent profile touch button
 Well can
 It's initially set way, easy do
 Go Settings, My shortcuts
7
 Megatones/hifi ringers: Yes phone plays mp3s, midis, such
 BUT --------- I think T-Mobile set phone PURCHASE $1
99 ringers website


 >:-(The software supposed let pick music convert format compatible phone, sync it
 HOWEVER ------ I've tried several ways make work, email mp3 midi files phone, file never comes correctly phone
 That ripoff
 And way, I noticed phone came like 4 built-in tones
 Previous Nokia phones came 8-10 tones
 Hence, scam I talking get purchase ringtones
So now, I'm relegated whatever choices site spending hard earned money something simple like ringtones
Suggestions anyone??8
 Volume: I hear fine, people hear me
 The volume key left side
 If can't hear, turn up
9
 Dropped calls: Helloooo people
 Dropped calls solely blame cell phone
 Most responsible wireless network, whether phone's software date pickup new cell towers
 I experienced less dropped calls I phone
10
 Black cover: I problem peeling off
 I always keep mine cell phone cradle home, special cell phone pocket purse
 No problems thus far
Overall: still fantastic phone, good battery, good looking, quality phone, good price
 I highly recommend it
 

I phone 4 days
 I got I thought would give better reception volume old phone (Samsung E-315)
 I also thought FM radio would cool
 It really improve reception, volume little better, earhole small wierd place, it's hard hear there's wind noise background
 The FM radio cool, comes one earphone, that's pretty worthless
 You also need hook headset hear radio loudspeaker
 Speaking which, speakerphone loud either
Other Cons bluetooth didn't seem strong
 I heard lot crackling I 5 ft away phone bluetooth headset (nokia hdw-3)
( I know it's phone I got Motorola Razr works much better, hardly static long distances (20+ feet))
 Another thing really irritated don't close everything physically close phone opens back spot
 This didn't seem bad first, seemed screw things someone called something else opened
 I also problems answering calls I going menus mobile web got really annoying
There good things: The ring plenty loud, screen clearly viewable even direct sunlight, internet (tmobile web) fast- maybe twice fast razor previous phone (boring looking screens though)
 The phone looks good cool feel
 Nice buttons easy press
 Very customizable menus net pages
 You edit zoom photos take them
 Nice list, notes, stopwatch features
 Reception average far I could tell
Anyways, I satisfied phone
 I paid $50 2 year tmobile agreement
 I brought back Razr $70 agreement, I happy Razr

 The Razr much smaller, great voice quality volume, better bluetooth, better (great) speakerphone, The screen huge amazingly brilliant (not great direct sunlight, that's major problem me)
PROS: screen light, fast net, customizable, list, feel, loud ringer, edit/zoom photos afterwardsCONS: menus don't close phone closed, little bulky me, dedicated vibrate key, boring net screens, loud/ear hole bad, bad bluetooth, one FM radio earphone, must plug headset get fm, battery life didn't seem great (but could blue tooth eating up) speakerphone loud enough, zoom picture
 

best phone I've Tmobile past 4 years
 bluetooth phone amazing, battery life last days, I get way better signal Nokia samsung motorola I've owned
 great features, camera's great, video's awsome
 looking upgrade I say go this, everyone's jumping ban wagon razer, knock people chair u show em ur nokia better
 

I 4 Nokia phones past looking upgrade 6010 I've last 3 years determined getting something Nokia time around
 After research phones, like Samsung Motorola, I eventually bought another Nokia
 I came pretty close getting Motorola RAZR, many negative reviews I read combined brother-in-law saying would stay away anything Motorola made think twice it
 I 6103 almost month I happy it
 I haven't problems yet, scratching breaking peeling rubber reviewers mentioned
 I never flip phone durability concern
 So far thing I noticed flip seems get little looser time, likely normal wear tear
Few minor gripes:1) I can't seem successfully transfer small, 14KB mp3, wav mid file phone use message alert tone
 Not sure Nokia T-Mobile issue
 Using Nokia PC Suite, I actually transfer file computer via phone's infrared shows phone
 However, I try select file phone says cannot support file format
 I bought CA-42 cable alternative absolutely worthless
 Please don't waste money device
 A part broke phone I able get out
 I haven't given figuring out
 If know this, please e-mail me
2) I wish memory phone
 I keep 8-10 HiFi Ringers phone without delete things it
 Also, I record 6 voice tags
 Your limited area
3) The phone doesn't come many ringtones, I contributed T-Mobile's bottom line downloading HiFi Ringers ($1
99 each) MegaTones ($1
49) wazoo
 I assume T-Mobile blame this
Things I like:1) I like voice tags really easy set use worked well far
 It would nice able set much 6 voice tags, though
2) The phone pretty easy use figure right box
 There's little bit battery life get going (at least experience buying new)
3) It small fits nicely pocket
4) Although camera substitute real thing, works well pictures okay, grainy blurry
 This I bought phone for, bonus
5) I like functionality calendar, alarm clock, notepad, calculator, to-do list stopwatch
 An upgrade area 6010 older Nokia models
6) I like FM radio it, wish also AM sports junkie I am
 Again, reason I bought phone, nice feature
 In general, I could see phones satellite HD radio near future
7) Bluetooth capability
 My Plantronics Voyager 510 works well phone
 It easy set up
 No need hope planets aligned getting sync'd
8) Custom ring tones groups individuals
 Like earlier reviewer mentioned, want one person ringtone, must set group
 Shouldn't gripes this, though
9) No problems cell phone reception
 This related cell phone carrier phone manufacturer
I given phone 4 stars
 While I think great phone, perfect
 However, I don't see phones compare and, depending cell phone needs, I would recommend 6103
Good luck research

 McCainwcmfun2001 gmail dot com 

We bought 20 phones business 3 months ago
 The phone good features could take pictures blue tooth technology would useful drivers
 The looks camera also really nice powdered black finish compact enough keep pocket
 What didn't count on, many damaged phones
 I've 4 phones returned damage left hinge phones resulting slight medium bumps
 This ruined visibility inside outside screens made phone disfunctional
 Also time, I've seen powdery finish rub underneath black slick finish
 I've also two phones damaged water
 One soccer bag got wet pouring rain
 That phone immediately ruined
 Overall, I can't give phone recommendation I would liked hinge flip phone set on, plastic cheap
 When breaks, phone
 I'd hate pay high price insurance T-Mobile offers, would suggest getting still decide phone you
 

I say great phone
Before samsung t209 wack
The nokia 6103 nice colorful screen,loud ringtones,loud volume earpiece,good reception nice picture using camera
The one thing I dont like I cant set backlight stay longer cool phone
If looking great nokia phone one get
 

THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE:if picture ring tone junky like am, NOT phone you
 memory backgrounds, ringtones, pictures, videos one section
 3 ringtones, around 15 pictures saved high quality
 needless say, THIS IS ANNOYING
Because this, I probably switch back old Samsung E 315
This phone good battery life, speakerphone
 

This good phone
 Quad band phone( work international) hands free feature, simple camera, polyphonic ring tones, quite small handy
The signal reception good
Simple good camera-rafeeq 

It's great phone I'm compliment I want ask question


How get video film?(this garys daughter talking) 

I got phone recently; it's cool motorola RAZR, fancy, many ringtones(only 6-7 available)
 T-mobile made pay $50 bucks phone order continue plan, buy directly Amazon, give phone free additional $75
Cheaters
 tmobile 

I agree positive reviews phone
To address problems people have-- it's main purpose phone, camera, video camera, FM radio speakerphone
 You can't expect perform exceptionally well comparison full-size relatives
I haven't real problems anything else-- reception good, bluetooth good (even $8 eBay headset), functions easy made easy access
 The phone fairly sturdy, rubber recently started wear 1 year use
I've also problems sending 'business cards' pictures back forth Palm m130 6103 using IR (which isn't often advertised), cell phones bluetooth
Cons: silver/white backing surrounding camera lense exterior display appears overheating couple spots (although I've never felt area warm); hinge sturdy, allowed top bottom half wiggle back forth enough buttons scratched main display
While I problems glare scratches main screen, I highly recommend 6103, cons nowhere near bad enough change mind
 This phone served extremely well year
 

This phone little quirks learn deal them
 One big quirk would screen reset main screen shut
 I also miss assigned ringtones I could program phone one
 And doesn't multi alarm function
Okay, things, phone great really enjoyed using it
 

My wife phone, I used awhile
 Reception T-Mobile service around Atlanta great
 When I talk sounds clear phone
 The camera takes nice pictures
 However, display picks inopportune times 'blank', meaning can't see who's calling and/or can't see number you're dialing
 There doesn't seem rhyme reason it
 Sometimes occurs immediately powering awhile turning back on
 Other times runs week it
I got sick listing wife complain undocumented feature bought new phone
 Setting another Motorola flip like one Nokia
After personally owning numerous Nokia non-flip phones excellent, one fell short
 The phone 9 months old never dropped damaged
 I suppose I could go whole troubleshooting process, possibly get repaired exchanged, pain



 

I switched back Nokia using Samsung cell phone t-moblie network
 I outside 1 year warranty period phone giving error message : "Not charging" stop sign
 I tried new battery new charger avail
 The phone gone bad sudden
 Does Nokia want us throw cell phones window every year?? This phone also switched twice reason normal use
 

took almost whole two week period upgrading ok keeping phone
 reviews site extremely helpful accurate
 I seeing issue reviewers peeling rubber layer phone
 That started less month later I keep phone case all
 One biggest complaints I phone Bluetooth Nokia Headset came phone


althought concept great I enjoy that, I don't like way sits ear I never hear call waiting beep
 I haven't figured way adjust beep loud enought hear driving
 I sure I need either call Nokia ask solution suck buy new headset I ready shell money yet already decent investement updgrade




 Other works fairly well
 It would great tho list alarms would work phone like alarm clock does
 

I "upgraded" I thought obsolete phone, Motorola V300 I bought several years ago
 Long story short: I resuscitating Motorola - better phone
One worst features phone - messaging
 After text message someone send it, message stays text box, want text NEW person NEW message manually delete old message
 No kidding
 No way around either
That's one example frustrations I've had
 Things require one button depression activate, often require three four
 The reception isn't great, screen resolution isn't great
 Its extremeley lightweight feels cheap
Scrolling phonebook super slow
My colleague, also bought hates phone, pointed someone calling open it, don't option ignore, opening=answering, something problem I did
Get Motorola V300 instead - great
 

I really liked phone 9 months
 It great reception battery life (really I care phone) survived drops
 However, one day main LCD developed crack (manifesting big black spot, making text messaging accessing phonebook impossible) apparent reason
 I don't know bad luck problem chronic phone
 You advised
 

This least favorite phone I've ever owned
 The ring tones comes joke
 Every one dreadful
 And phone's user interface completely non-intuitive, I've used lot cell phones
 I usually keep cell phone least two years, one going go
 

Overall phone pretty good time, picture quality fine I love feature, I'm disappointed following: outside material peeling (have months, I take good care it) buyers mentioned
 When I want ringer set "silent", I go thru several steps rather one click phones do
 I also wish back-light would stay longer
 I've dropped calls, especially dialing
 It wasn't easy finding car charger it, I found use one model 6102
 Now I'm trying find case cover prevent outside material peeling more


 

Soon I bought phone outside material began peel phone
 I dropped calls phone t-mobile phone I ever - even drops calls I signal moved
 People hardly ever hear I saying
 To add day turned would turn day
 I go back using old phone months I could rely phone work (or stay turned on)
 






Let start saying tha NOKIA phones best comes signal recpetion, quality sound durability
 Nokia N70 probably best phone time higher range (even better N90)
I phone 6 months now
 The camera good, download/ upload pictures ringtones cable comes
 The screen big anf bright
 The thing I looking protective cover screen prevents scratches
 

It's great phone lots features


advantages-lots add ons software, themes including 3D games available-new firmware quite stable-flawless sync outlook groups, categories supportdisadvantages-sound quality good compared sony w810i-no a2dp (means u can't use stereo headset listening songs-slow UI-batttery life good 

I phone english arabic, it's excellent fun use
It two cameras quality pictures videos best I've seen phones, nokia cellphone quite popular middle east I havent seen I live Canada
 Creating little movies really fun, also get hang you'll realize it's pretty easy use
 Enjoy
The copper/pearl colour best opinion, lovely phone
 

Excelente telefono, por eso se gano todos esos premios, lo unico malo es que lo meti en la lavadora de ropa y hasta ese momento duro
 

Very advanced software, image quality, expandable memory, good looking
 slow browsing, extremely slow install wallpaper
 


































































































































































































































































I truly love phone compact ever, actually hear well phone
 Love features very, easy use
 Have remember turn button side right phone
 Biggest asset right free Bluetooth
 

This reasonable phone features wise - battery life poor Nokia
I owned Motorola sometime ago, experience I swore stick Nokia powerful battery life excellent reception
 But phone needs recharged everyday else, switches off
 This power saving options like screen saver, display wallpaper on
 I use phone texting, internet use, radio, camera bells whistles included
 So I pretty disappointed result
 The voice quality phone also poor, especially compared basic Nokia phones I owned
 I also used charge previous Nokia phone 3 days
Would recommend one
 

I got phone upgrade Tmobile, I use really durable phone takes allot damage it, clumsy I sometimes, I tend drop phone allot, I'm 2nd one already, It's really sensitive kind damage, that, gets awesome reception everywhere, camera takes ok pictures, I'm text-a-holic inbox alone hold 300 messages, play mp3's it, buy memory card store everything phone memory card well, allot cool features, awesome speakerphone it
it button side flips phone open kinda cool, camera even takes "night mode" pictures actually come pretty darn clear
the battery life pretty good also charges pretty quick
so all, it's 4 star phone
 

This cool phone
 It Nokia reliability along traditional easy use operating system
 Its also loaded features including megapixel camera, expandable micro sd slot, click open flip, also one feature everyone left far fact play mp3s bluetooth headset
 This feature specific phone tmobile lineup
 This great phone I would recommend anyone
 

CONS:I circles T-mobile phone since January
I FOURTH Nokia 6133 since January similar problems phones
 The phone problems reception causes echo-y, Darth Vader, Chipmunk, Windtunnel sound caller call receiver
 I told everything T-mobile account, tower, phone, antenna, I know every 6th phone call result TERRIBLE sound quality
I also experienced occasional problem text picture messages locking phone (which known error phone)The camera button goes time
Speakerphone almost useless
Battery life good advertised
 I need recharge everyday
PROS:Love button press flip phone
Phone layout great
Good little cameraLike built in-radio(Sorry I don't helpful pros)2 stars style features, -3 whatever causing audio issues
P
S
 I used loner phone NOKIA 6133's worked fine, coverage area


 

I purchased phone less 6 months ago, though love durable amazing features, faulty
 First, can't much customization shut off
 And lastest headache, "The SIM card registation failed", day long allowing miss calls
 I loved phone much I first purchased I recommended close friend phone problems + screen blanked out
 

The glue/binding held metal frame around screen started coming metal frame sticks stab cheek I don't super glue every couple weeks
 Nokia/T-Mobile cover cosmetic damage
 Yes I didn't anything cause it
 Sound quailty poor terrible
 Screen lighting poor terrible features intuitive
 Camera simply awful
 Pictures come grainy matter what
 I'm phone hell 16 months I break buy new phone w/o contract discount
 

This one phone,should pick Tmobile store purchase, best interest PUT BACK DOWN
I bought phone February 2nd, fine good
The battery life pretty terrible,but expected
 Last week,out blue,my phones sound died
I could hear thing, Tmobile store went
 I told "just freak happening, defective speaker dying beginning
" A replacment would coming soon, shipping charge
Brand new,I told since still manufacturers warranty-I hope so,seeing even two months
I also bought $25 memory card transfer ringtones
 Great
 Three days later,the nightmare began
 The sound quality AWFUL, sounds like person windstorm
And volume,despite ten, sounds like 4
 On top that,my ringtones,all four I bought $2
50 pop, transfer old phone despite told did-due copyrights
Wait,I bought them,dont I get I want them? I would get elsewhere tmobile allow Nokia 6133 
mp3 ringtones anyone them,so spend almost three dollars ten secons song stuck synthesizer medley
Its back tmobile store
 How helpful employee was(or not
) I asked pointblank "was refurbished phone sent me?" question dodged
 He said nothing wrong sound, put speaker phone sounded fine
Speakerphone adn earpiece two different things
 He also said ringtones didnt work memory card bad

despite everything moved OFF memory card two days old
Tmobile reps knowledgeable,especially tell nothing done "live it" listen problem
Customer service sending second phone,and we'll see bad one is
What new problem IT have??Bottom line: buy phone
I dissapointed Nokia,they usually better brand this
Tmobile,on note, always better too


 

I wish I could tell Nokia helped us gained loyalty life
 Unfortunately, balk face known manufacturer defects give paying customers proverbial palm talk to
 I ask simply, customer service gone? Why seemt companies longer care whether choose busines them
 THE STORY: less 30 days new 2-year contract T-Mobile, rubber coating began peeling away phone near flip-button
 Both T-Mobile Nokia claim known issue, though Nokia rep told us originally IS known issue 6103 model model replaced
 There several chat rooms forums several folks experiencing thing (I don't address forum - wife found them) given bull crap song dance Nokia
 How many complaints receive becomes "known issue?" And since they're offer help ship phone cost examine see believe manufacturer defect, leaving without phone, meantime, I doubt many folks take helpful offer, letting continue disavow knowledge
 Additionally, we're told deem damage cosmetic, we'll charged repair
 Well, damage IS cosmetic, still manufacturer defect
 There seem plenty users phone happy it, I say purchase risk
 And please, Nokia & T-Mobile, least act like care customers
 The glib, bottled responses aren't appreciated enough force us make decision power over, choose business anymore
 Truly saddenned, Cincinnati
 

I phone six months I throw (metaphorically) wall
 The phone pieces great device seems carefully designed annoy
 Caveat: I'm kinda power user; want camera phone moderately useful addressbook, product fine
The biggest annoyances:* location camera button
 Inevitably, every time I took phone pocket would camera mode, often couple pictures pocket
 This means every time want use phone first exit camera mode -- completely negates convenience little spring-loaded lid
* interface
 Nothing consistent
 Configuring one-touch dialing completely separate address book completely isolated setting ringtones
 Having figured configure something, always took many minutes remember change it
* synchronization
 Don't use phone computer
 Not painful set (I'm pretty technical, synchronizing phone Mac faint heart), phone actually changed data (moving addresses "notes" field)
 Seeing I decided phone go
This phone marketed low-cost competitor things like BlackBerry Treo, anybody really wants organizer phone would poorly advised use Nokia
 It's worth savings
 

This phone clearly beats many hyped phones market
 It features phones boast robustness durability Nokia
(btw, one takes g8 pics,best I seen cell phones)Few lacking I see are:-Inbuilt memory barely 11MB, far 60-80Mbs phones
-Can't assign mp3 files ring tones
( I usually operate silent profile, I fine it
)-MicroSD card slot best positioned, little awkward slot cap
 

I problem someone else (sent pictures, broke


 sending picture causes white screen "reboot")
 Tech help thinks might old 32K SIM card
Enabled bluetooth process starts asking passcodes, etc
 Tried change default 12345 zip code
 Bottome line, time I done stupid menus, seen enough CODE ERROR messages, locked DESTROYED SIM card
 Had get new one rebuild ALL data
 Not happy
Moving Motorola Samsung pretty easy, functionality keypad-wise
 Moving Nokia WEIRD
 Don't like layout ALL
Now good stuff
 The camera component probably best camera cell phone I've used seen date
 Not soft blurry Samsung
 Very bright clear displays, inside out--very high resolution
 Has capable night vision mode (could hosed picture send capability days, knows?)Based problems I had, similar others, I'd rate 2 stars
 But SIM problem replacement works fine, I'd give 4 stars quality camera
 So gets 3
 

What's great phone? First off, plenty options really nice display
 It plenty bells whistles IM, games, web browsing, radio, mp3 etc
 But errors? It lacks capability turn mp3s ringtones, I don't call huge deal maybe would
 Also, battery life somewhat short default however way double triple it
 I'm going quote one reviewers (BTW, I used tips really help lot
) "Power Saver" options (settings => main/mini disply, turn screen saver, turn kepyad, start-up switch tones etc
) 6133, battery started lasting around 4-5 days moderate usage
"Considering get phone free web $100 store, I surely cannot complain
 

When I received phone, camera didn't work properly
 Sending picture would cause screen turn white would take back main phone display
 Amazon sending replacement phone
The buttons side inconvenient
 You accidentally press power button, turn phone off, on, put different modes depending many times press button
 I phone silent mode movie theater, button pressed pocket turned sound on
 Very embarrassing
The camera button also side pressed accidentally, turning camera on, turns drains battery
 I don't use phone lot, charge lasts day half
Now I don't know much SIM cards
 I wanted store contacts SIM card able move another phone easily, allows store one phone number person
 I multiple numbers contacts
 I ended storing phone's memory
 Since first phone defective, I copied contact SIM card
 Since SIM card allows one number per contact, split contacts, renaming sequentially
The sound quality great
 I 3 LG phones sounded louder clearer phone
On positive side, phone looks nice buttons great tactile touch
 I can't stand Razor Chocolate style touch keys
As someone mentioned before, import MP3s, can't use ring tones
 T-mobile charges 2
49 hi-fi ring tone
 

Hopefully, skip reviews (or any) cell phone, tend submitted adolescents, many yet remove product box, basing "review" effect device fragile emotions
My wife I purchased Nokia 6133 little month ago, thus opportunity use offer somewhat informed opinion
This good cell phone supposed do: Work cell phone
 The first one I got problem volume cutting out, I returned got replacement
 I since problems, one I bought wife worked well get-go
The push-button opener nice, allows one-handed opening without fumbling around
 The call quality decent (remember, it's two-way radio, "real" phone)
 You make custom ring tones, WAV file format
 The camera decent, considering it's part phone doesn't flash
 The inside screen looks incredible outside screen decent
 The phone organizer, calendar, calculator, etc
 Everything works quite well
 The phone pretty solid feel it, without heavy
 It thin easy carry pocket
 And way, CAN lock keypad external buttons easily, despite rumors contrary, won't taking pictures inside pocket
 Again, many "reviews" submitted cell phones come consumers yet picked owners' manual
 Battery life also fine
All all, good product
 If you're T-Mobile, like me, probably won't get better phone, assuming don't want one called smart phones
 Give try
 

We wanted upgrade old blue Motorola V300 phones, loved, aren't bluetooth compatible-- weren't sure Razr
 We shopped Samsung also ended Nokia 6133 based 2 slaes people said
 It sounded great
 We bought one
 The first call made parking lot store, knew instantly different phone
 The sound quality came near used old phones
 It sounded tinny echo-ey caller call reciever
 The next problem camera kept coming button side phone gets bumped, comes camera
 (Someone else mentioned problem here
) This also happened even left parking lot
To fair, might great phone every way
 It lot great features beautiful display good quality camera
 However, kept 1 day returning solely mentioned reasons
We ended one Motorola Razr V3 one VT3
 The sound quality much better Nokia
 We happy phones
 They gotten bad reviews original Razrs lot problems revamped solve those
 Also, used Motorola menus, probably hard time Nokia
 

This phone all
I take pictures it, make ringtones mp3 collection, take video upload computer email family friends, sync calendar Google Calendar get text message reminders appt
, call quality great too
I even use note feature keep important numbers addresses, employee number work new address I moved didn't memorized yet
And I'm bored, I open phone play game tetris, add on, still


If don't want commit high-priced top-tier phones, phone you
 The keys wide screen large, makes text messaging pleasure
Another cool feature give PowerPoints, like I do, (I'm teacher) sync phone computer use clicker move slide slide
 I'm married computer anymore
 I move around room give lesson PowerPoint
 Cool, huh?Go get phone
 

3 replacements nothing
 The phone stops working normally week completely reset factory settings
 It cut-off conversations, disconnects minutes conversation, screen becomes white one thousand weird problems everything full network bar
 T-Mobile NO solution solve problem offering crappy RAZOR
 From point view T-Mobile screwed MyFaves software
 Do buy it
The phone great screen, nice sound quality (from reset reset)
 

Speakerphone works great sound quality normal mode isn't clear
Camera great like another person wrote, buttons side inconvienent
 You often find pressing accident
Plus isn't much ringtones choose from
 Not even normal phone rings wanted that
The back lid holds battery comes easily
 

This phone weathered surprisingly well far (of course, I take good care it)
 Although phone somewhat large, nice looking aesthetic (IMO, others might find ugly) top excellent inner outer screen
 Pictures taken built-in camera won't inner screen justice, load pictures use preloaded wallpapers themes really appreciate screen
The battery life commonly listed complaint phone I admit it's valid one
 Battery life enough last least one day you're average user however heavy users may find battery life problematic
 Battery drainage depends apps use
 Any app uses java (games) accesses memory card (music player) use power
 You may able squeeze couple days use power saving options available use like regular phone however you're user like plays games music phone, you'll find almost completely ineffective
 My personal preference turn power-saver mini display show analogue clock screensavor ASAP (5 sec)
 The analogue clock much easier read power-saver clock (which digital clock) easily see even backlight shut off
 (I power-saver main display
)Surprisingly enough, even though inside main display near impossible see direct sunlight, mini display seen perfecty well (in almost sorts lighting conditions, matter)
 It seems use different kind LCDs I wish they'd use main display mini one
Using auto-flip button looking cool almost art
 It sometimes doesn't work well phone held certain angles (namely straight upright) works best held near horizontal (up 40 degrees)
 Make sure fingers aren't blocking upper lid it
 Take moments practicing you'll like champ auto-flip work right public makes look like complete dork
 :pThe best thing I like phone I wasn't expecting active idle mode
 Gives quick access music, lets put quick note directly display, gives quick access apps well direct links webpages (accessed TZones)
 That coupled customizable shortcut buttons makes phone convenient use
My main complaints battery life buggy bluetooth music blocked web access java apps
 I find music app easily crashes using bluetooth headset I've already tried three different headsets it
 While can't use mp3s directly ringtones, still incorporate part theme you're custom theme building
 As others mentioned, camera button easily pressed it's best use auto-keylock don't want take pictures pants/purse
 I use phone holster don't usually problem
Overall, I like phone lot
 It's beautiful phone quite handy times
 

Nokia first phone since I always wanted return Nokia great phone perspectives
 I bought one quickly realized Nokia NO LONGER user-friendly phone
 I going details setting options SO complicated
 Also, front display glass broke first time I dropped - fragile
 Anyways, sitting shelf 1 month use
 

I purchased phone small size
 However, there's quite stupid designs there
 1
 socket earphone covered, remove back cover plug earphone



 What idiot designed ?
 2
 There's lock camera button side phone
 easily trigger drain battery
 3
 Battery life short
 I don't know it's T-Mobile though
 I bought two new phones family plan
 The Sumsung I carry around needs recharge every day
 This one sits home time still need recharge every 4 days
 My 5-year old Nokia 2160 Tracfone holds charge lot better this
 

The original version great Nokia phone really cool
 Big display, email, fast internet
 High-end flip phones like getting point almost anything fancy Windows phones do
T-Mobile screwed up
 You can't use 3rd party email, mapping, HTML browsing, RSS feed software T-Mobile won't let use Internet programs didn't buy them
Ironically, one thing could better call quality
 It's terrible, many would say fine, higher-end phone like could little better
So left carrier decides don't need fancy stuff?1
 A phone acceptible, exceptional, making calls
 If that's want, get something cheaper
 The good news phone seems dropped price like rock, maybe buy actually worth

 A 1-megapixel camera, almost pointless way send pictures picture messaging, resize pictures resolution phone
 No installing email applications, remember?"The 6133 mobile messaging Internet powerhouse
"? Um, no
 

Features wise, phone good
 Nice simple flip design, good sound quality, good reception, nice 'extra' features radio music player
However, 12 days standby battery life ridiculous exaggeration
 I don't use phone lot
 My weekly talk time probably 1 hour
 I don't regularly text, use radio, use camera, music player
 Yet I cannot even phone's battery last half advertised standby time
Despite properly 'seasoned' batteries (several cycles complete drain recharging), battery came phone lasted 2-3 days (again, minimal use)
 Then I got replacement battery that's lasting whopping 1-2 days
Maybe 12 days much ask, shouldn't advertise standby time that's common experience
 I would even take half that, even 4-5 days
 Not able meet mere 25% advertised standby time ridiculous
 

This pretty much basic flip phone
 It easy use
 (I don't know wrong people saying it's hard use) Also, I guess people saying phone broke them, experience little different
 I've dropped mine 100 times including one time I dropped 20 foot cliff I put pieces back together works fine
 The rubberized coating worn corners though (big deal
) plastic covering front screen scratch dropped
 

This user-unfriendly cell phone ever made
 It's poorly lit it's can't see it's charging, can't see options highlighted you're menus trying adjust something
 It's flimsy, too: I worried taking casing would fall wouldn't fit back properly phone
 The settings aren't go crazy looking (the manual help whatsoever); would put tones "gallery" option?But worst part organization design phone's software
 When I called carrier, rep I spoke said word around office trying use phone like navigating maze
 It's stupidity navigation system: say want go particular option choose wrong icon menu
 Okay, good phone, problem: hit back option you're back previous screen select correct option, right? Well, guess what: NOT phone
 With phone, anytime, anywhere hit "back" option, kick right menu completely back phone's "home" screen START ALL OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN TILL YOU GET IT RIGHT
 It's hideously frustrating phone brand new you're learning everything you're bound select wrong option anytime (which every time), you'll start instead merely going back previous screen
 ARGH
Some things weird: default ringtones put memory cannot used - I get message saying tone copyrighted
 Well then, heck idiots even put phone call ringtones can't used ringtones?? And course can't buy ringtones put either phone's firmware won't accept formats they're sold in, you're stuck stupid default ringtone
 So, dumb
 The thing phone good kindling
 If want actual, usable phone, buy Motorola
 

Others noted quite bit, featuers I haven't bothered pay for, things I used phone for, I would say it's ok free phone, worth paying for
As primary functionality, I haven't problems calls all
 Navigation pretty simple
 It's sturdy I like button opening it
 If want phone work phone, one isn't bad
The camera phone essentially useless
 The quality bad you're likely bother using it
 I tried using fun while, found nothing came well stopped
I loved radio phone walk subway
 I could catch news
 But phone stopped recognizing ear piece plugged in
 I got replacement phone, thing happened replacement month so
To picture ID person, need person's info locally phone, card
 Phone numbers added defaulted locally, problem I switched phones move contacts card
While seems typical, games pointless
 You play minutes / levels, pay
 I don't understand couple simple games can't included
 

Pros:1
 Call clarity [never experienced drop call]2
 Speaker Phone3
 Design almost perfect4
 Software5
 Camera [takes video too
]6
 Manual button flip open [comes handy]7
 Lots data storage possible microSD card (sold seperately)Cons:1
 No USB2
 Data port, Power button microSD slot weird places3
 WiFi would've niceI gave 4 stars still room improvement
 

This bad phone, using LG Muziq Sprint, phone sub par indeed
 My gripes:1
 WTF can't set MP3 ringtone2
 comes head set 3
5mm adapter use own
3
 sd card slot battery cover
 gets annoying don't usb cable4
 charging port top phone makes awkward use charging
The good thing is, Tmobile gave free


now I know why, probably unable get rid them
My likes phone:1
 descent camera video2
 easy use like nokias3
 find durable4
 music player phone good (although MP3 ringtones)In summary, don't care MP3 Ringtones using headphones without pay extra adapter, IS good phone stand everyday wear tear 

Pros: Flip button, memory slot, separate holes charger headset, EXCELLENT MP3 player clear loud sound (good enough boombox), alarm goes even phone silent, camera (though clear, least it's there), video record long memory lets (most phones record 15 secs, one record 40 minutes depending much space have), radio, though can't set MP3's ringtones, convert WMA still set them; camera flash [night vision], use headphones listen music, drains virtually NO battery life (I listened 8 hours straight phone still full bars),Cons: Can't fast forward rewind videos, radio one station (?? Am I wrong?), voice recorder record one minute (unless there's way change this? On old phone, able record much memory hold), texting, it's hard change Abc T9 numbers etc (maybe that's me?); records latest call log (meaning mom called 12 another time 1, it'd show one 1), whenever change theme ringtone reverts back Nokia theme (this annoying), can't set separate ringtones different people (is also?, camera's sometimes blurry sometimes clear, there's button go directly music player (my friend's phone this, it's extremely convenient), battery life sorta short (unless using headphones), I hate jack headphones much, screen gets dirty fast (hard clean corners), phone's sorta bulky wide little ugly sideSo basically, bit cons pros, however, pros obviously lot stronger cons minor things brushed aside
 I'm pleased phone


if looked better, that'd nice


but that, I'm love phone
 The one thing bothers fact can't ff rewind videos, way phone? 

I've carefully culled reviews getting one
 I've used Samsung, Motorola Sony Ericsson before, I eager try Nokia phone
 Clamshell relatively new Nokia, heck, right?Okay, I like:1) Simple Bluetooth connection PC
 The desktop software pretty basic (and handles contacts rather clumsy) set up, synch contact/appointment/files phone pretty easily
 I day morning
2) The rubber-like texture phone nice
 It doesn't slip fingers surfaces, I've history losing phones slipped pockets
3) The button-flip interesting, although spring mechanism makes cheap plastic cracking sound
 The inside screen's power-up also 1/2 second behind flip open, slightly annoying
Okay, I guess I'm going negatives now


1) I VERY excited radio MP3 features I found dismay NEED use included Nokia earphones (with Nokia-custom connectors) play either them
 The neckstrap/earphone acts FM antenna, I hear, it's mess wire neckstrap need untangle everytime need use music features
 Yes, there's speaker put music (which pretty decent size) NEED darned neckstrap/earphone connected order music player work, even want hear speaker
2) Most phone's mic slight bit noise echo, know mic works
 This one doesn't, makes slightly weird talking experience -- I ask "can hear me" times I assured mic working fine
3) The customization options limited (compared Motorola) terms choice ringtones come box, background/themes, even way configure menus
 I thought Nokia would better, trying navigate options figure want wasn't better Samsung's Nokia's
4) The chrome plated border around keypad downright cheap (in cheap, plasticky way) there's visible gap border keypad, see crack, especially keypad backlight on
5) The charger uses proprietary plug -- mini-USB like Motorolas Blackberries
 This means I'll need make SURE bring Nokia charger around, instead one 4 mini-USB plug chargers
I'm keeping phone I'm learning live limitations
 If could let phone play music STANDARD headphone jack loudspeaker without stupid earphone, use standard mini-usb plug charger, I'd rate phone 4 1/2
 

The first time I got phone microphone broken
 I could hear anyone, could hear fine
 T-mobile sent another Nokia 6133, working fine
 I phone even 3 months yet, microphone broke again
 This time I hear person, can't hear anything me
 Please, save money don't bother phone
 It's worth hassle
 

I got phone little better version samsung
 It nice button open phone- I call lazy button
 Not lot memory available
 Have enjoyed phones better
 camera okay- different features photo editing add ons photos, I wouldn't use phone, long recoding time good sound lot memory
 Bluetooth phone- plus
 

I purchased 6133 replacement Nokia 6230, since seemed everything 6230 had, *plus* 16
7 million color QVGA internal display, handy one-button opening flip-phone design, Micro-SD expansion 2GB removable memory, 1
3 megapixel camera, drag-and drop access memory-card's contents via DKU-2 USB cable
 I disappointed phone; everything 6230 some
 The negatives I find device are: 1) battery life short - compared 6230, I find last 1/4 bar battery life end day, means recharging every day two; 2) T-Mobile firmware disables lot features phone's identical twin (the Nokia 6131) capable doing, running Java apps access internet, using native MP3 files ringtones, IR infrared port
 In summary, great phone, out-of-the-box, severely limited T-Mobile's customizations
 

I picked phone replacement Sharp TM150, similar features
 While Sharp (may rest peace) one favorite phones, new Nokia stacks extremely well
Having read many comments here, I wanted point many gripes/flaws phone actually pretty easy work around fix
 Unfortunately user manual detailed, takes little bit hunting find stuff
Key Lock: This well engineered feature solves problem "it keeps taking pictures inside purse
" The auto-keylock set lock keys certain amount inactivity (default 1 minute) automatically unlocks flip phone open, don't spend time trying remember unlock it
Self Portrait: I couldn't find anything manual, close phone press camera button side, let use exterior screen veiwfinder take picture yourself, case you've forgotten look like
The picture messaging bug unfortunately little persistant
 It would nice TMobile would update firmware phones get around this, work around it
 Yes, irritating return store next morning, didnt' take long fix wasn't really big deal
 The bug starts showing mess "Themes" settings
 In case easily fixed store
 So you're type person wants create bunch different wallpaper themes change time, probably good phone you
 I problems customizing main external wallpaper, setting ringtones friends, etc
The display quality phone great, colors much brighter previous phones I've had, making easier see bright light
 The menu layout buttons customizable (though takes patience)
 The camera takes high resolution photos, contrast seems little whack they're particularly good photos
 The video quality pretty low, lots compression
 This bit bummer, hey


 phone
Call quality nothing spectacular, wasn't bad either
 Sounds like pretty much every cell phone I've (this number 9 me)
The media player cool, although I can't imagine I would want listen music phone I perfectly good ipod hi-fi headphones
 The thing I've used playing songs small group people
 Its novelty music player
 

First all, I don't data plan don't use Internet features
 If want phone that, review going helpful
 The things I care phone are: flip-phone, speakerphone, bluetooth, quad-band, radio, music, good phone book software
As configured, phone ok
 The camera button side takes pictures pocket (unless lock keypad; see below)
 The radio music players many clicks away
 It doesn't come memory card
 And doesn't normal headphone plug; headphones phone ships stupid (though fit ears well)
BUT, things fixed
 After following things, phone became excellent:(1) I got 2GB micro SD card newegg $20
 That give room 1000 music albums
 I mac, fact phone plays AAC files awesome
 You get smaller card even less money
(2) I set camera record photos movies onto SD card
 I plug card computer (I adapter already) access photos movies (and music) directly
(3) I set two navigation buttons jump radio music player 1 click away opening phone
 All buttons programmable, make main apps one click away
(4) Very important: I set key lock turn automatically 20 seconds camera doesn't take pictures inside pockets
(5) I bought adapter $4 I use favorite headphones music (no mic, though)
I haven't phone long can't comment battery life listening radio music
 But battery life normal phone use excellent
I note also phone book software good: It doesn't incredibly idiotic thing one entry per phone number many phones do; one entry per person
 It also stores emails, street addresses, everything else phone book laptop, awesome
I looked carefully T-mobile phones available, given things I care (see first paragraph), clearly best option
Oh, phone, works fine too
 

Pros - excellent display menu, user friendly shortcuts, good battery life(see comments below), good speakerphone
Cons - average call quality, cheap cover
Overall - good phone
 I don't use phone camera music player I comment that
Battery - Several people indicated problems battery reviews
 The battery phone Nokia 6102
 I previously Nokia 6102 battery lasted 4-5 days moderate usage
 When I got 6133, battery drained 2 days
 However I enabled "Power Saver" options (settings => main/mini display, turn screen saver, turn keypad, start-up switch tones etc
) 6133, battery started lasting around 4-5 days moderate usage
 So I strongly suggest enabling power Saving options phone
 

I've owned Nokia 6133 1-2 weeks now
 It likely going back T-Mobile
- As noted earlier, phone crippled accept MP3 ringtones
 It play MP3s media player accept WMA ringtones, cannot set MP3 ringtones
 Hmmm
- The phone NOT email client, regardless Amazon description says
 This wouldn't bad except


- The phone allow Java programs access Internet
 This kicker
 This means GMail's Java client work
 This also means try download actual mail client, won't work
Note also Nokia 6131 (roughly non-US version phone) features
 In order get features phone, pay someone load 6131's firmware onto it, likely void warranties lets T-Mobile get away abusing customers
Unfortunately, I think phone otherwise really nice
 It beautiful screen, I love push-button flip, usable phones there
 However, opinion, inexcusable T-Mobile done customers
 

I've owned 3 Nokias, 1 Sanyo 1 Samsung
 The Nokias beat competition
 This first Nokia flip phone it's first flip phone sound tin-y
 I love various profiles I create own
 The phone quality quite good
 I don't use music, I iPod
 The camera 1
4mb it's great, it's good quick picture something need (fender bender such)
 I've downloaded graphics ringtones
 No problems
 So far, I'm pleased
I'd highly recommend it
 

Just got phone -- it's great one thing
 T-mobile pulled Verizon intentionally disabled setting MP3s ringtone
I phone support hour, going entry level support, transferred Nokia support, who, 20 minutes discovered message displays "Not allowed activation key" means carrier disabled functionality
 Then called back T-mobile went entry level support second level support tech support, person saying surely it's mistake, tech support people looked said no, intentionally disabled you'll buy HiFi ringtones
Very stupid
 But phone still gets 4 stars, it's really phone's fault T-mobile turning customer unfriendly company
 

I really like phone
 It small, yet powerful
 I sync outlook keeps contact, schedule, items notes
I replaced IPAQ phone this
 It nice

The Hi-Res screen really nice speaker phone ringing REALLY loud

 Battery life bit short due bright large screen
but I recharge phone every night

 it's big deal

As reviwers pointed out, T-mobile put restrictions phone cannot access web using third party software
However, T-mobile also started phase access web using t-mobile web account ($5
99) starting March 2007
 So need $29
99 plan access web
 So even get firmware upgraded, access severely limited
 Who would pay $30 slow connection small screen web?In summary

 nice phone

but stay away need access web & e-mail
 

Purchased T-mobile
 Reception low signal areas MUCH better previous motorola v300
 The v300 used drop calls nearly every 5 min, 6133 dropped call yet
 Excellent display
 Battery life less v300
 Camera works great well lit situations, good low light
 The inside buttons seem kind cheap, work well good tactile feedback
 The Nokia menu OS seem years ahead Motorola, I really like response speed menus
 One plus: Nokia provides free (Windows) software connecting to/managing phone, works great bluetooth (assuming vendor doesn't disable it)
The phone's features could documented manual little better
 

I got phone since I qualified T-Mobile upgrade
 I able send picture I went changed one setting messaging settings white screen problem appeared
 I called Nokia talked someone named Lydia
 We reset settings back factory defaults works
Call quality great reception better old Motorola I had
 Ringer volume handset making call little low conversations come clear
 I get 3 days battery phone sometimes network reach hours shorten battery life keeps searching network
 

When boyfriend lost phone, T-mobile convinced "upgrade" get buy one get one free promotion phone
 It waste time
 This phone neat features worst reception sound quality I experienced cell phone
 All calls sound metallic, allot static, volume goes out
 At first I thought phone, I asked boyfriend said problems
 We phones 4 days going return them
 Im thinking going back old Pebl phone even though doesn't favorite fives
 

I T-mobile 5 years, 3rd phone
 Phone quality great, people told much better calls sound
 I continue reception issues deadzones I previously had, I new issues signal strength
Reminder: PHONE


not digital camera, video recorder, ipod
 Having additional features nice, buying PHONE
mp3 player & AM/FM radio
 Performs pretty well, although audio played speaker best
 Playing mp3s gym headset works great
 The mp3 player shuffle capability
 When listening song incoming call comes in, mp3 player & AM/FM immediately stops, picks back call ends
 You need invest another $40 buy micro SD card (for phone) SD adapter download songs playing phone
Digital camera/video camera
 Performs poorly unless bright lighting conditions
 When shadows dark areas, image fuzzy poor quality
 Zoom works OK, pixelizes image slightly
Battery life
 I talk 200 minutes, go gym 45 minutes listen mp3s, I still 50% battery remaining
 I make practice charge battery every night, I much longer would last
 

I got phone little year ago really enjoyed compact, sensible design
 It feels nice hold use well
 After nine months, flip pins started loosen one fell fairly soon afterwards
 I tried deal T-Mobile Nokia got real assistance
 Recently, top phone gotten shaky screen felt loose
 In past week, it's given "SIM card failure" message disappears restarting
 Today, it's coma
 The small screen comes on, main- texting, calendar, text
 It also stopped dialing
 I'm disappointed phone
 

I selected Nokia 6133 researching number T-Mobile phones Amazon, CNet, etc
 After reading many rave reviews phone I disappointed audio volume level handset
 On highest volume setting I trouble hearing people call me
 The speakerphone headphones sound fine (on side least)
 Since I'm outside 14 day "no-questions-asked" return policy I guess I'll keep phone, it's still major let-down
 

I got phone month ago outside couple dropped calls I problems
 The thing I wish I could change pay twice download callback ringtone ringtone
 Other camrea great I want keep phone forever
 The headset came phone cool good all
 It made calls without knowing it
 Just everyone aware that
 

I probably spend less 2 hours day phone, battery phone lasted day half
 The speaker worked 90% time, I could make conference calls (not without incredibly loud irritating noises speaker), would recognize bluetooth headsets should, camera constantly turning pocket, physical design phone meant constantly pulling whiskers cheek, matter close I shaved
 I returned phone T-Mobile week
 Save trouble get different phone
 I ended Motorola V195
 It's great basic phone
 No camera, mp3 player, every phone-related option phone have
 

I like phone I'm 3rd one using warranty still year phone plan
 All problem, display (both) stop working I blank screen
 Now warranty I buy them, take another 5 till plan 

As I renewed contract T-Mobile 2 month ago, I decided go Nokia 6133
 Finally nice flip phone Scandinavian company
 Coming Europe, I familiar Nokia products, due fact, Nokia much popular overseas US
But beside good experience Nokia phones (I owned 5 last years), I say, one weakest Nokia phones far, reasons:1
 Battery life
 If want recharge phone every 1 2 days (at medium / low level use), stay away it
2
 Internal memory
 More less existing
 So forget taking pictures3
 Reception
 At best medium level
 Especially indoors reception poor
Overall, phone looks nice, doesn't live Nokia's standard (which I used to)
 I decided go Sony Ericsson instead
 

I loved old nokia phone (before one) time upgrade I got one
 What big mistake
 I hate it
 NOthing like old one, battery doesn't last long camera always turns itself
 Very uncomfortable
 

I owned phone 6 months T-Mobile network nothing hassles (dropped missed calls, poor sound quality, echoes line)
 Got replacement phone 3 month, improvement, lot's excuses T-Mobile
 Might combination low quality phone (the phone looks really cheap)and T-Mobile network
 Customer service willing send yet another replacement Razr, that's it
 I would stay far away T-Mobile, cheap phones, cheap calling plans, poor call quality, ignorant customer service

Thank-you excellent service great price I received you

 

I bought battery replacement/backup battery included new Nokia 6126 AT&T
 The one shipped new phone lasts approximately 12 hours 1 hour talktime requiring recharging
 WELL one I bought Amazon exactly same
 As I said above



PRETTY USELESS
 

Do buy it
 It's waste money
 It's junk
 I got husband's cell Nokia battery came phone good
 But


 dissapointment
 It short life like one
 

Very nice phone battery
 It last long time
 It got quick ready fully charged I got mail
 

This original equipment battery great price shipping
 Works great I received 2 days
 

Exactly advertised inexpensive branded battery
 Very happy transaction
 

I extended life 6002 Nokia phone buying new battery, BL-4C, took little time get hands, phone running full time
 

Too erratic, shouldn't wasted time
 BUT THE PRICE WAS RIGHT
 BUY CHEAP AND YOU GET CHEAP


 

I dropped cell phone multiple times, lowers battery use per full charge
 With new battery, phones lasts twice long old
 It operates normal new battery would
 It came Nokia packaging perfect condition
 If need quick & cheap replacement battery, would way go
 

You might pay little bit reliability offered OEM products gives one much peace mind
 I always willing wait little longer pay little I know I getting counterfeit
 I think I got money's worth
 

It's good battery
 It works Nokia 6103 maybe phones well
 

I rate item receive use
THE BATTERIES NEVER MADE IT TO ME EVEN AFTER THE MONEY WAS TAKEN FROM MY ACCOUNT AND I HAD WRITTEN TO SAY MY ORDER DID NOT GET TO ME
I placed order Amazon delivered
 

nokia bl-4c battery got counterfeit fake number 04060407030000420323 

This replacement battery looks exactly like oem battery came phone
 The old stock battery holding charge (ie needed recharged 12 hours standby)
 Replacement battery holds charge days normal use
 

I ordered using battery month now
 It working fine problems whatsoever
 I bit hesitant reading reviews 

 worked quite well thus far
 

Same battery comes phone, doesn't longer life, it's handy two forget charge
 

This cell phone battery works great amazing deal compared buying one carrier
 

It's month use far, good
 Delivery prompt hidden fees
 

Bought product without checking Nokia web site first
 There several alerts ripoffs
 The product Nokia labelling, real Nokia battery
 It NOT work cell phone
 Nokia phones smart work battery knock-offs
 This vendor removed Amazon listings
 

This battery good replacement battery Nokia phone
 Lasts long fits perfectly battery compartment
 Great product
 

Batteries arrived good shape
 Not sure 100% new
 The battery life appear much improved replacements
 

The battery works should
 Delivery fast, although S&H charges bit ridiculous small lightweight item
 

battery made china, works well, came late, seller prompt replying emails 





The point connects phone older type, larger recent Nokia phones, thinnner
 

This real deal,not cheap knock-off
It also second adapter I've bought,the first cheap knock-off
That died matter couple months
I bought one first
In case real Nokia much better product much better buy money
Buy one first
You won't regret it
 

Nokia makes good solid accessories cigarette lighter adapter exception
 Fit,compact sturdy, carry vehicle ever go plug phone
 I keep mine constantly plugged even phone
 Great buy
 



























































































































































































This phone major technical advance Nokia
 Besides VGA resolution camera, triband (1900/850/1800) work parts world except Africa mideastern countries (900mhz), phone much offer outdoor (or even indoor) enthusiast
 It built-in flash light, loud alarm, compass, bubble level measure balance, speakerphone more
 I loved Nokia phone I usually Nokia fan, going get one Nokia phone, it's phone
Although cover looks water-resistant, don't count much
 Describing durability 5140, Nokia uses statement "protection splashes dust" level protection phone indeed
 In upper part find slot handsfree device, speaker flashlight
 It possible small quantity water could penetrate slots, harm phone electronic parts isolated blocking rubber cover, allow water get inside phone
 The speaker display tightly bordered rubber cover
 Therefore, might problem swim phone time time, recommended
 Very interesting designed carrying straps keep telephone upside-down position available
When come across Nokia 5140, attention undoubtedly drawn two features: bubble level top left phone main function calibrate compass
 Read carefully
 - A classical compass, shows directions world, graphically, compass rose, numerically degrees (e
g
 350 N), adjust direction, want hold, degrees compass allow lost way
Beside compass, out-door functions may considered flashlight, available models 5100 1100
 You find useful drop keys dark example
 The thermometer also handy, which, way paragon accuracy
 In arias, temperature approximately 20 C, used show 22 C 27 C; seems accuracy thermometer depends close phone body
The last, extend uncommon function out-door usage Sound Meter (Decibel meter)
 Its usage bit contradictory, least give chance realize noisy environment, live in
 Please imagine following situation: falling asleep tent, set decibel meter alarm you, noise goes 70 decibels
 If thief bear approaching tent - Nokia 5140 give sign
 Of course imagination, might think probable scenarios
 

I bought two cell phones--one boyfriend one myself
 I prone dropping phone bad places (like instance top wooden staircase, tile, etc
) rubber sides, top, bottom protect phone well
 It water resistant amazingly durable
 One best things screen gets completely beat up, get replacement Xpress-on cover comes multiple colors--orange, red, black, green, purple--includes everything (even new screen shield thing) except new keypad, buy separately I believe
 The downside covers must ordered Europe
 Not big deal though, cost $20
A lot great features; flashlight, camera, video, compass, AM/FM radio, etc
 And awesome reception
 Talking phone exceptionally clear (NOT depending cell phone company)
 I've driven road people Cellular One different phones two bars, I mine
 It's pretty sweet
While I relatively easy cell, boyfriend not
 About month purchase, managed accidentally put laundry
 It went full cycle looked like would never revived
 After drying out, started right worked perfectly aside stubborn back-light refused work
This Nokia easy use well worth money, I recommend phone anyone wants something simple, durable, packed features
 

My 5140i 8 years old
 Still works, battery still last 7 days
 But cover totally desintegrated chinese aftermarket covers I able find don't last month (the flip rubber cover base protects ports falls within days)
 So, since I fan smart phones, frankly rugged phone (with termometer, compass, flashlight, noise meter) available Europe I amazed see new 5140s Amazon
The delivery prompt, I got 4 days
The product however nothing short dissappointment
 The &#34;original&#34; made Hungary, official Nokia factory (no longer exists I think), one hand came Hong Kong
 Made China
 The batteries, also chinese (two included) last 2 days (and quality assembly dismal doest fit properly), bottom half (for reson keys latin hebrew letters too) case doesn't attach top half (which way doesn't level help calibrate compass)
My rating 3/5, mainly I want give shot, see long last
 So it's based love brand original product
 If I new particular phone I would given 2 stars 5
The op system slightly updated longer Polar Fitness watch support
 

I number issues purchasing product PCMONDE
At first stock, I received defected phone, replaced, I got phone worked USED, 8 weeks placing first order I working unit
 To fair PCMONDE refunded half purchase cost
 



































































































Don't buy Nokia 5300
 It doesn't right cord fit it
Good idea
 

Great power outages last several days, vacations,away electrical source long time
 

Nice product, works well comes Lithium batteries
 Mine emergency prepared kit; like power outages, hurricanes, etc
 As confusion 3 plugs claims come with, I called Energizer today this
 There updated model include small Nokia plug newer Nokia phones, matter fact updated model 3 different plugs included it
 The updated model apparently uses part number; part number CEL2NOK, however updated package says Nokia / Palm Treo, package says Nokia get older one one larger size plug
 Hope I helpful
 

Contrary picture Amazon web site, package comes one power connector
 The connector older Nokia phones
 Newer Nokia phones (e
g
 6103) uses smaller power connector won't fit
 Total waste time purchase return
 I wrote Amazon error, haven't fixed web site
 The three stars reflect product quality I use it
 Rather due Energizer Amazon errors describing product
 If go Energizer web site, see picture three power connectors, too
 

When battery low I charge go
 I leave brief case
 I don't sit wall outlet wait recharge
 It's life saver
 

Be warned
On product descripion Amazon clearly states "Comes three power tips, compatible Nokia models"
 On actual product received states packaging ( outside) "Includes 1 Cell phone charger, 1 Nokia tip, 2 Energiser e Lithium AA batteries" Inside packaging indeed find 1 Nokia tip stated packaging, course "thicker"tip older Nokia models NOT new thinnest ever tip Nokia's latest smart phones Nokia 6110 Novigator, Nokia E65 etc
 Thus description given Amazon 3 tips misleading , it's totally false error product I received
 The description "works Nokia phones" therefor also highly dubious
 Thanks Amzon, I waited 5 weeks get South Africa, checked information provided ensure usability, yet I still stuck prduct totally useless mere refund compensating serious errot ss well time postage wasted
 

The Good: WorksThe Bad:Very hard open battery compartment cover
 Had use plier open
 Not weak
 What thinking?
 Did usability testing? 

I expecting charger good energizer, keep mark
 Drains batteries kept inside short period 

product charging cable tip NOT new Nokia phones (which require small head tip), incompatible Nokia charging heads
 I really disappointed Amazon, post enough product description shoppers tell kind cellphones product used for
 

I bought power older Nokia Phone emergency power outage
 A points:1) Rechargeable batteries work product2) It highly recommended get lithium batteries power product Duracell Energizer type battery charge premium them
I thought building device I bought one
 I probably build better one I use rechargeable batteries
 Radio Shack I come
 

My husband go grid week youth group trip I wanted keep cell phone charged
 This even included battery - Fantastic
After trip, went hurricane supplies box
 

THIS IS NOKIA SPECIFIC WITH THREE DIFFERENT TIPS FOR THEIR PHONES


Absolutely wonderful fits old new Nokias
You know see things store think "hmm, interesting, worth researching" THEN NEVER do? Local drugstore price TWENTY BUCKS made easy pass :) However, Texas recently power outages rolling blackouts ALL I could think Energi-To-Go instant charger
 I use cellphone tether laptop + spare battery 3G network well talk time minimal texting
After reading Amazon reviews instant chargers, ranging "fantastic waste" I found complaints proper tip individual phone possibly BUY another cord/tip actually fit, use instant charger - EEK
 I STILL wanted one back charger, called Tech-for-Less tips, told ALL NOKIA tips included EXCEPT mini/micro USB ones
I'm pleased item dumb semi-smart phones


it works well
 


















battery worse one replaced
 waste time
 yes chaep, guess get pay for
 














































































































































Prior buying cell phone accessories, I highly suggest check phone manufacturer's Web site make sure accessory model number exactly one built phone
 Don't count Amazon sellers tell isn't compatible phone
With regards actual purchase this, HS-5 Nokia Headset, Amazon, I would recommend buying A1 Accessories
 I problems two headsets (they stopped working months), A1 immediately shipped replacements I notified defects
 A1 fair deal with, third headset works fine working fine many months
 Also, appears product sold legit actual Nokia product
The product works great phone
 I like on/off switch, makes convenient answering calls ending without open close phone flap
 Once headset plugged in, also set phone answer automatically don't touch phone -- keep earpiece truly remain hands-free
 It's also attractive, lightweight, discreet headset
 The clip convenient too, wire microphone don't run astray
 I small ears, I found little discomfort earbud (which I chose one first place)

Updating review




having kinds issues lately, can't tell sure phone, I dropping calls multiple times daily basis
 After speaking AT&T;, I switched temporarily Sony Ericson, Motorola(really expensive slider phone)
 They sucked
As far Nokia, battery able get day anymore, I heavy user I used be
 The bottom line I buying cell phone I can't use make phone call, I don't want it
 Unfortunately I travel internationally much, I need cell phone service work abroad
 The AT&T; store guy says Blackberry's way go



 researching idea right now
 

I unbranded N75 wireless Bluetooth feature available AT&T version (as Sept 2007)
 I love Nokia phones - phone works well phone
 The Symbian OS really useful applications available line
 I highly recommend purchasing computer, installing via Bluetooth included cable don't loose firmware update
 Bluetooth Stereo MP3 well integrated phone features, phone audio choppy (appears either phone Bluetooth get's busy interrupting music)
 If Nokia cleaned stereo choppiness I'd give 5 stars
 

I nothing problems phone
 When I renewed contract AT&T last year I really excited get phone
 I wasn't exactly happy paying ton money it, seemed everything I looking phone
 After months started acting strange
 I would go check phone missed calls find shut off
 I would turn back would fine
 Then started shutting restarting frequently
 At times I would take battery seconds reassemble try get restart
 Not would phone sat next me, would I middle conversation
 I sent original phone back AT&T sent new one hoping glitch original
 My new N75 thing shutting freezing likes call random people contact list I hardly ever call
 I VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PHONE would recommend putting money it
 

I used Nokia phones past eight (8) years
 Never issues phones, well now


 :( Purchased phone June 2010 October 2010 started freeze gives Phone failed startup contact retailer
 So I did, Nokia gave steps reset it, still error
 I called reseller "unlockedcellphonekings" told sorry 90 days passed nothing do
 I called Amazon Customer Service, comment nothing sorry
It unfortunate pay $100, item un-operational 3 months
If buy phone see warranty
I sure I buy another Nokia again


 :( 

The Phone came scratches
 It supposed brand new phone I received refurbished product
 I don't think it's Amazon's fault need maybe use different supplier product says new ship refurb
 Also Phone let send picture messages I one voice message send notification I another message comes in
 The phone also lock I take battery restart it
 I like design phone I don't like way new
 

This phone horrible
I suggest everyone buy phone phone online
The day I ordered another blackberry phone also pathetic
The chargers wont work,while using getting heated
I think don't want throw phone making us pay make us throw trash
 

I need new phone found n75
 Didnt realize excatly found looking internet, wow went received like kid new toy, perfect large screen keypad searching long time, I dont understand int provider never offered asked like usual got dont know answer, love n75 recommend large hands fingers










 

Seller's response good expected
 Precise On Time
 The Phone, far working perfectly 

Es mi primer celular 3G, excelente cobertura, capacidad de almacenamiento y una gran herramienta de trabajo, lo recomiendo, la camara aunque sea de 2Mp, de d&iacute;a captura muy buenas im&aacute;genes de noche pierde resoluci&oacute;n 

 Su opci&oacute;n de administrar la m&uacute;sica, las llamadas entrantes, msjs, y la camara desde la tapa es simplemente genial y muy &uacute;til 

 

She loves&lt; her
Music, vids, great battery, packs good punch
 

Worst make Nokia


I guess N3310 far better one


No battery life


No internal phone memory

and even u add memory card, u cant transfer anything phone memory less


no ringtone compatibility- nokia tools sucks big time doesnt know wat encode normal mp3


voicemail feature proper


Camera ok


Ringtone volume already good

But overall, STAY AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY FROM THIS PHONE




 LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE


GOD BLESS U

 

The Nokia N75 lasted 16 weeks, still works open closing Hinge broked it's hanging 2 pieces, I spent $199
99 2 year contract guess NOKIA said phone dropped, I especting that, that's way them, signs physical damage phone, can't win


Now I got recent model motorola phoneDO NOT BUY THIS ITEM


 

Ordered Nokia N75, later discovered I need old one I going replace could fixed
 Returned it, got refund, hassle, great service
 

Signal good, vivide picture, feel good hold hand, two screens make perfect cellphone, however cam good
 

I bought phone replace old one--identical
I liked old one much didn't want change
 Doesall I need perfectly
 Easy hear, take pictures, read, view,edit use menu,etc
 

This phone refurbished phone, battery original longer works, turns minutes use 

Nice phone

 u cant compare iphone smart phone

 gifting purpose, cheap best one

works fine

 Durable

 

While phone operates well basic functionality (calls made ease), challenges
1
 I issued Operator's Manual therefore teach use it
2
 I able use Text Messaging system five months I got it
I sure service provider issue what
 However, I finally send & receive texts
3
 The music preloaded liking, I accidently press buttonson front console makes song play I h*ll time trying shut off
4
 Interested getting accessories it, don't know would improve capabilities without knowingwhat benefits stored it
Not techy, I prefer cut chase shown functionality / capability I disposal upfront
Would recommend phone others, addressed via provision manual purchasers would positive experience
 It also looks nice unique


 

This phone excellent doubt it, price gadget, size exactly best

the problem encounter volume
 The volume okey wanna use Music greats true people make comment phone right,sometime even kind product always comment

my comment volume, somebody call call somebody else volume compatible ears Low bearly cannot understand talking, maybe especially crowded area alot people around

you dont idea problem

this first time encounter problem

i put already high Volume ,let see better still problem? 

I bought Nokia N75 cell phone
 I phone less 1 1/2 months
 The first thing happened battery lasted 1/2 day little use
 Now phone keys #1, #3 keys work
 I bought Nokia N 75 phone rating mostly 5 star
 Don't beleive it


 Just relize phone dose warranty
 You unhappy phone cost $129
00 + shipping find bad phone
 

phone refurbished, battery original, always dead purposes, lose signal
 try contact ask exchange
i mail back phone
 two weeks later, got phone back, exact phone mail them, problem solve
 hate 

The Nokia N75 price less $100 good
 The features good, battery seems okay, screen big, sound great, signal transmission good - call drops
 I observe bug though, battery power icon inside screen misleading times
 On outer screen shows 1 bar, inner screen almost full sometime suddenly gives low battery message
Overall nice mobile offered price
 

Being somewhat used candybar phones, I reluctantly decided give Nokia n75 try disappointed Motorola's software present popular RAZR SLVR phones
 I fond memories Nokia phones I starting cell phones, I happy become part family again
I didn't know things changed much Nokia since I left
Everything little different I transitioned Motorola before; Nokia ran dreadful Symbian software phones least n75 ran abysmally slow
 I experienced many dealys lags applications
 In receiving text messages, I would often blank screen phone trying process message display it
 Never I seen lagging cell phone
And perhaps biggest fault n75, talk time phone absolutely unforgivable
 In every phone I've model, I could seemingly talk day nary worry recharging encountering low battery warning
 With Nokia phone, I lose calls evening battery runs quickly; manufacturer documentation lists four hours talk time -- something dreadfully short modern phone
This phone expensive flashy -- don't fall trap
 You find better phone better price somewhere else
 












really good product
 Because colored put lots outfits depending color clothes wearing
 also buy one color stylish
 also recieve many coplimets matching taste
 

This one highest quality covers find, made Nokia (which company manufactures 3360 phone
) Not covers go front phone


 go back well
 This ultimite way express yourself, great looking patriotic faceplates sure stand out
 

This charger works fine; phone settles right without problem
 Presumably save wear tear circular power port phone (this uses two copper &quot;fingers&quot; supply power)
 With devices I've owned, I've seen circular ports wear time
When purchasing item I failed read fine print
 This &quot;cradle&quot; only
 While called *charger*, doesn't come AC adaptor needed actually supply power cradle
 You use one came 3360, (like me) shell cash buy another (that's &quot;Nokia Travel Charger&quot;)
 I'm bit disappointed price, included adaptor
 

like product match lot different clothes
 


I bought Iceberg Grey faceplate replace standard navy one came phone
 I'm glad I -- color much appealing, subtle silver tinge visible photos
 In general, I recommend Nokia-made faceplates 3360 phone, since I found after-market face plates didn't fit phone quite right
 The Nokia-made face plates tend expensive, I clearly see difference fit quality
 

Cool cover goes xpress-on covers
 You must cover
 

hi like know u head phone cell phone noika 3360i wear 2 hearniad want know u head phone volume like know store much 

With controversy surrounding safety cell phones, important use hands free headset
 These hedsets make safer talk phone, allow hold phone far away head


 This way less harmful rays enter head, allow safer talk phone
 Plus*** using hands free device (like product) also helpful use driving car
 This way still talk phone keep hands wheel
 

I gotten many compliments 3360 faceplate
 I first phone faceplate, It goes xpress-on covers total versitility, I highly reccomend
 

We phone, comes blue
 We getting phones mixed up, I surprised yellow
 She really likes gets tons compliments it
 Amazon bit expensive, since (


) AT&T store
 



Works fine
 Just little smaller legnth I thought, like I say, works
 I'll recommend itJerry 

This one highest quality covers find, made Nokia (which company manufactures phone
) Not covers go front phone


 go back well
 This ultimite way express yourself, great looking faceplates sure stand out

1
 It covers port hands-free mike/headphone, can't keep phone belt want talk hands-free
2
 It's impossible get phone case without pressing buttons phone
3
 The clip holds case belt strictly necessary, it's quite bulky
 

I bought product 6 months ago AT&amp;T
 I walking flight stairs phone fell right case
 After replacing ruined phone cover (the main components damaged thankfully) I bought body glove cover
 It works GREAT
 My original case would worked fine covered keypad
 As is, easy phone come case
 I would highly recommend body glove, case, Avoid it
 

The case nice needs adjustments way made


 first, part back clips belt clip holder low


 since centered, swivels easily stay upright belt
 If male part clip case bit higher would correct problem
 Second, on/off button hard push cover it, even harder turn off
 Hope find helpful
 

With open face, case protect phone? I find still scratched etc

Useless
 

As practical matter unusable, especially seated
 






































































I bought husband, construction industry
 He tendency tough cell phone cases hangs tool belt
 He got Verizon Brigade (Casio) trouble finding decent case would hold phone securely hang vertically tool belt
 This case tough, durable, secure hangs tool belt perfectly
 He absolutely loves it
 

it's little bulky, well built
 It small phone I intended (and listed phone) Casio Brigade
 It fits tight continually pushes buttons
 I likely find another use case
 

I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY HUSBAND AS HE IS OUT ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME AND HE KEEPS IT ON HIS BELT
 ONE DAY MY HUSBAND BENT OVER AND THE PHONE FELL OUT OF THE CASE AND THE ANTENNA BROKE AND WE HAVE BEEN HAVING NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE SINCE THEN AND NOW NEED TO BUY A NEW PHONE
 I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED 

























I person drops phone way often
 While case definitely helped protecting phone, completely broke first time I dropped phone
 I used super glue "fine" ever since, ugly
 If don't drop phone, definitely get one, beautiful protect phone scratching, drop phone, much better silicone version case
 















It's cheap little thing acts like cheap little thing
 Hard plastic makes uncomfortable ear little while
 I keep forgetting there's answer/hangup button it, I keep ending calls - I'll get used that
 At first, lots static headset meets phone, seemed magically disappeared
It's good price, bad Amazon uses shipping company do
 

Comfortable sound/mic good, "Accessory supported" message NOKIA 6350 phone
 If Nokia 6350 get HS-9 


 

This best hands free cell phone headset I've found older phones Blue Tooth compatable
 It fits either ear, comfortable wear, excellent sound quality makes using cell phone driving MUCH SAFER
 It also makes hearing caller much easier crowded noisy situations
 Fits Nokia cell phones
 

Overall HDB-5 Boom Headset Nokia good product
 It helpful leaving hands free driving around town
 Out open road sometimes picks much road noise I can't hear person I called trouble hearing me
 

Product defective money quickly returned me
 Amazon
com best customer service
 

This best design handsfree cell phone use
 Those ear tunnel designs begin painful within hour so
 Buyer needs sure correct connector cell phone
 Initially, I purchase design Verizon store new would work
 After I returned discovered proper connector design, I purchased supplier good savings
 

































































































Plantronics needs lower price item
 It wind gust protection, often giving muffled audio calls
 Plantronics offers much better ear pieces much course
 I upgraded much better headset wind guard it's worth it
 Plantronics stand products I found even headset sturdy, par talking outdoors phone
 

I seen Radio Shack $29
99
 This great little light weight, confortable headset
 You configure right left ears
 Very light sounds good
 































































reason giving low rank actually sent wrong battery,which donno gonna rule everyone asks battery,they sent Lenmar CLK-5C 5B sown above
i pay shipping back

but gave refund battery's initial shipping

anyway Lenmar great battery trademark,i tried b4 works really great


 

got wrong size battery, one ordered
 didn't wanna deal hustle kept took loses
 always looking easy hustle free transaction
 
















































































This phone gets great service evrywhere go (Cingular)
 It cheaper newer Nokia models features Cingular store, I didnt sign 2 yr contract
 It doesnt camera iTunes internet service, phone cant beat Nokia
 

Even though phone older technology, I receive/make calls anywhere Colorado
 Heck, son calling middle ofAlaska one summer
 Rugged consruction simple use
 Battery life excellent
 Does bells whistles like phones
 Would recommend phone starter phone teen--it take beating still work
 





































































































































The Plantronics earbud/headset best product class I've found
 I bought several earbuds made Cingular old pop-port Nokia phone
 None worked right, all
 Nokia Cingular support phone (with accessories)
The Plantronics product comfortable ear figure wear it
 The microphone stems earbud like headset crystal clear I told
 The earpiece also fine job reception
 The wire switch volume control microphone mute--a thoughtful feature
 I've used several weeks problems
 In fact, I purchased one wife too
 They work perfectly
 I highly recommend one older Nokia phones don't want change calling plans get new one
 

I find hard rate product
 On one hand, supperb sound quality - expected Plantronics
 I'm able conversations driving car stereo blasting yet I'm heard lout clear end problem hearing caller
However, comes design


The ear piece awkwardly attached ear bottom relyig squishing earlobe betweem two parts ear piece
 After hurts
 Lucky I use car short conversations, otherwsie I doubt I would keep it
 I think piece designed different ear mine
 I guess ear bit small it
Still overall I'm happy it
 So hence 4 star rating
 

Great headset leave desk office, I wouldn't travel it
 Comfortable long conference calls worked easily Nokia phone
 















The product worked well, complaints
 The problem right I received it, I upgraded phone
 

The cord short, I hard time charging phone car
 So, even though inexpensive, lost money
 I would order again
 

What I say
Works great, nice price
I tend forget charge home kept talking driving
 

I bought one 4 years ago, worked great continuously I dropped driveway ran it
 It charges faster wall unit, LED tells what's up, cant beat Amazon's price shipping cost 

Good product 

 advertised 

 would buy again
DW 

The product genuine shipping really fast

 I definately shoping delar again
 

This low quality made charger, job
 I used times far problem
 It's difficult insert lighter springs hold contacts rough-- typical type cheap materials
 





















































































I would like preface remarks two points
First, year ago, I finally got cellular telephone kids schedules
 One us take places pick times week, traffic around arguably worst planet, creating interesting delays nearly every day
 And I admit sometimes I call home grocery store 23 different verities BBQ sauce list says "BBQ sauce
"Second, blood pressure soars rude louts think right interrupt lunch dinner infringe reading time doctor's waiting room talk cell phones
 I saw table four people, talking absent entity cell phone entire meal talking real people beside front themNow, said, Nokia 3595 apparently high-end low-end entry level phone
 That suits fine
 This silver-gray mass wires circuits enough features going time
 I didn't know cell phones whistles bells games, voice tags contacts, alarm clocks, caller ID, such
I like fact contact list lets something like five numbers 500 people
 Five numbers per person---that's pretty crazy me, fact phone numbers people use them
 Why run eight numbers per contacts bestow full complement eight phones octopi
The battery lasts five hours solid talking, soul earth I want talk five hours straight
 The sound decent though I certain amount trouble talking space trying hold plastic rectangle close ear
 I feel like jaw floating away face
 (I guess folks like flip phones cost infrequent talker like willing spend
)I able figure operating options, least ones I paid get, without resulting manual, I'm sure phone intuitively designed not
 It may actually moving toward sort collective consciousness enables species share knowledge like island monkeys started washing sweet potatoes certain percentage populations started washing potatoes(In Transcendental Meditation, phenomenon termed Maharishi Effect
)The various stock wallpapers phone pretty boring tend make hard read small display window
 (I cannot fathom folks would want send photos back forth devices poor video resolution
)The manual comes phone OK, text designer could done much better job creating distinct, clear headings
 I'm still sorting humorous sections "Your WAP browser," "PUK codes," "Potentially explosive atmospheres
" (I cannot believe many people jawing away cell phone pumping gas
)This little sucker nearly tough hockey puck, too
 I've dropped pavement least half dozen times snap back together looked fatal plummet
 Well, it's scratched scarred bit, still works fine
Well, I'm one masses now, longer cellular Luddite
 If see walking street wire ear, gesturing wildly, arguing invisible beings, please help me
 

I mean I complain


 free service
Overall bad phone


 plenty options like text messaging fun stuff


 It voice dialing (you know say name calls person) feel like setting up


 A nice address book feature allows store several numbers one name label cute icons like house home phone little cell mobile phones etc


Sometimes freezes (kinda like computers) remove battery get work again
? What expect free though?Major complaint: WHERE'S SNAKE??? I miss it
 But cute bowling game it
It's phone


 serves purpose
 It take pictures, that's cameras for

I phone getting phone I currently have, missed ever since
 I would switched back, possible, I change GSM, phone TDMA, made impossible, cell phone provider would let me, said longer made, way I could get another one
This phone may little large side compared lot newer, sleek designs market now, fits hand good makes easy one-handed manipulation keypad
 It's also lightweight
The reception excellent
The wallpapers made writing screen hard see, I opted use background screen
This phone got completely immersed water, convinced ruined, I went shop day got new, different phone, I regretted, next day, time dry out, turned indication didn't work usual
Battery power awesome
 I talk lot, could go week without charging
 Now I don't use anymore, lays desk drawer, occasionally I turn get number I need I didn't transfer new phone, I'm kidding


It still almost fully charged battery months laying power off
It didn't lot good ringtones
 Most silly sounding, since I kept mine silent time, wasn't big concern
I've always Nokia fan, I believe one better phones
 No bells whistles, good, dependable phone
 

The Nokia 3595 ok phone nothing basics
 It rather big phone wont easily fit pocket, good performer comes actually talking, holds signal well hardly ever drops calls
 The screen color, good color screen, washed looking dim
 

best phone
 14 wanting cell phone forevr since older sister got 4 years ago (she's 17 now) dad left words: Honey, u find cell phone works cingular 80 dollars, get you
 So found Nokia 3595 cool

lots static barely hear person end 





















Bought replacement battery along Nokia N80 2 years ago
I recently wanted replace battery phone discovered battery doesn't fit (it's 4 mm long)
Thankfully I didn't lose much money deal, sure would nice took N80 model list, others don't make "mistake"
Beth 























































I 6600 phone
 I thought good deal 3 things one, useful advertised website
 But, I received item, I realized compatible it
 The cover also small phone din't fit cover
 I havn't used charger, 2/3 things I expected
 I would recommend anyone go pack
 Hope helps
 

Pretty bad deal
 I bought Nokia headset right away instead ordering really *cheap* kit
 It cheap price-wise, quality-wise well
 Did get body cover phone advertised
 All I received car charger really bad headset
 People started begging use headset soon I put on
 Neither could I hear person talking
 I don't know charger works, I never used it
 The two things I bought kit for: Headset - Extremely bad sound quality Phone Cover - Missing kit; serve purpose
 Save 10 bucks something useful
PS: I dont know would given phone cover I asked one, mistake I never questioned regarding this
 

FYI I product I 6620 place phone use earbuds
 I think Nokia changed connector 6620 call pop-port proprietary connector multiple uses
 9
99 good deal case charger don't expect use earbuds
 

Accessory pack includes plain car charger, plain hands-free ear bud, snug fitting leather case
 All-in-all pretty standard stuff, exception case
 Although appears fit well after-market case, seems fit "TOO" snugly
 The phone, case, emits high-pitch sound speaker hold ear, phone turned connected
 I suspect one phone buttons pressed/squeezed, thus generating sound
 I'm trying stretch case out, turning phone placing case night
 Hopefully, work, case looks good certainly provide protection phone
 




































Very disappointed
 While outgoing voice recieved clear end, incoming voices sound distant, muffled
 

I got price I don't use sound quality speaker/earbud poor
 It sounds weak muffled tinny like pilot airplane
 I could make it's pretty bad
 





























































































































































































































Very disappointed - plug doesnt stay way use hold plug yoru phone
 Very disappointed 


This great deal nice 2 year contract along N75 phone cost
 But believe N75 horrible
 I using past one year
 This phone symbion OS host features along it
 It great built music player output headphones
 The phone many features tends slow down
 At times phone automatically turns off
 The signal goes away good reason never comes back restart device
The handset tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo delicate
 It cannot used cruel world
 It meant kept locker
 If drop you'll see minimum 10 scratches it's body
The best part cellphone it's battery life - it's toooo less
 On top cellphone low battery audible alarm feature tell going turn off
 I use cellphone around half hour everyday I keep charging everyday
I would recommend product anyone
 The plan good one go handset available never N75
 Nokia known without battery power everything good nothing
 

Beautiful phone beautiful functions except crappy delay take picture camera function
 When flash goes would expect next second take picture, NO literally wait least 3 seconds move get shot expect want
 











































































































































































The product build quality good works blackberry
But good fit ear, comes ear I manage fit home
 The battery life pathetic
 

Purchased size mind, BH-201 disappointed
 Easy set up, easy figure without memorizing instructions, easy wear either ear, even comes quick-release-and-attach neck strap I find pretty useful
 Very functional driving
 Charges last long time (I don't talk 'a lot') recharges quickly
 Sound great ends
 Comes different ear buds custom fit comfort
 Best all, price right
 I use almost daily like it
 

I bought blue tooth earpiece loosing previous one less 48 hours buying it
 So I looking something could hang around neck


 said, also pretty good sound quality price without fancy noise cancellation (at least I've heard people I talked with)
I fan ear hookup, surprisingly comfortable fall easily
Things caused reduce rating three stars: charger mini USB, micro USB, making finding charger rather difficult; earpiece slides easily cord, making pulling cord difficult keeps slipping cord won't pop easily coat sweater; keeps disconnecting reconnecting - don't know phone's fault bluetooth


Overall, relatively good buy, despite annoying Nokia internal ring-tone (I'm Nokia fan)
 

I bought lanyard
 I wear badge lanyard work I wanted headset I could hang badge
 The headset pops free lantard easy enough sound quality first rate
 I really like it
 Battery lasts 12 hours don't talk much (I don't)
 Nice companion CECT m800 Wristwatch Cell Phone
 

The Nokia BH-201 small, discrete, fairly good bluetooth headset works quite well
 The reception quite good, comes charger
 The lanyard also useful feature
 The drawback constantly adjust ear
 Very good price/performance value
 

The Nokia BH-201 Bluetooth Headset I looking blue tooth technology
 I alwas running office go another appointment, find haste I forgotten headset
With Nokia strape around neck day ease pug ear
 In addition, I longer forget I I rush office
It easy charge last entire day
 

This bluetooth headset works nicely
The design pretty cool,and I like strap connects to
It came different earbuds likely fit ear
Once figure little wheel fits perfectly,it's rare falls out
It's pretty comfy annoying
I must say I like fact magnetic thing dangerous near sort card magnetic strip
 

I like bluetooth except fact battery last long time
 I recharge every 3rd day
 The majority time, standby mode I driving
 

good price, good productIt easy use comfortable
 The strap handy I lost bluetooth headsets without realizing - small, lightweight items slip away without sound 

Worked fine couple days, broke
 Wouldn't charge power up
 Might fluke 2 stars
 

Didnt work
 Connects I receive call, call transfers phone soon I answer it
 Very poor range
 Not recommended

I purchased item Nokia 5100 series phone disappointed find didn't work all
 The adapter seemed fit snuggly phone, 2
5mm jack popped slightly adapter couldn't hold connection
 I never able hear person calling test it
 Nokia owners, save shipping send back
 

I'm phone lot business great leaving hands free take notes, drive, whatever

I like design product
 Unfortunately, function well - difficult hear volume setting phone
 

This great walking around office

Too bad case lasted longer phone
 It's durable material design change phones often


 isn't worth getting 

I'm fan cases TOTALLY protect phone without sacrificing useability

 Takes stretch enough easy on-off, it's "formed" good go
 
































































After original hands-free headset bit dust I frantic find replacement
 My Nokia flip phone, I told, date service provider longer sells type headset
 They kindly suggested new phone
 As if

 I thrilled find I needed Amazon, yet skeptical getting one
 But great price I figured worth experimenting
 I find works nicely one I purchased couple years ago Cingular retail store
 I'm happy be
 It little hard fit connecters phone time two removing reconnecting, works like charm
 I would absolutely buy another one need arise
 I ordered A1 Accessories another reviewer given thumbs up
 I agree
 My new headset arrived mailbox days ordering perfect condition
 $4 A1 compared $21 plus shipping Nokia



I pick $4
 















I bought battery replace old battery Nokia 6010
 The phone indicates charged, soon I make call goes dead sudden
 I change phone I could make receive calls anybody
 Battery working properly
 










We bought unit back cell phone chargers have
 It inexpensive job
 It's one types fit older GM car lighter socket
 

Doesn't fit ancient phones
 Not worth sending back, due original cost vs
 return shipping
 We tried, failed
 We live past
 Oh well
 





I hate anything goes ear
 I don't like ear buds, I don't like gel things
 I don't like Nokia either
 It really hurts
 I'm really annoyed cell phone industry completely ignoring need people don't like things ears
If I connect strap Nokia, won't stay ear
 I need strap that
 

I Samsung headset and, week, I threw away
 The Nokia BH-700 great

 I've used Treo 750 Blackberry 8830 without problems
 The sound quality fit perfect
 This last Blutooth headset I'll ever own
 

BH-700 good looking light weight headset
I've used many mobile phones & I've found performance bad following reasons:-Range 2 meters (6 feet) only
 Nokia claims 10 meters (60 feet)
-Range goes 1 meter (3 feet) fully charged, disconnects even pocket-Continuously disconnects phone-Not comfortable fit
I don't recommend it
 

I love Nokia products specifically looked Nokia Bluetooth work Nokia N800
 I trouble headphones came I use Skype
 The BH-700 amazing
 There little static sometimes overall great
 The volume control great
 It fits nicely ear, wife says big her
 I read reviews said would go far I set N800 middle classroom I cleaning able walk entire room without interuption
 The best thing I turn automatically links N800
 It great product, I would recomend Nokia lover



 

I bought 2 weeks ago screwing Motorola H700 6 months old
 First all, I hear clearly others also said never think I using bluetooth
 I using Motorola Krazr phone Verizon carrier
 The necklace also convenient prevent broken pockets
 Strongly recommend



 

I love earpiece great go far distances
 The necklace comes comes handy alot
 There one problem I noticed fine end


 "The Fitting" Now I notice fitting ear pretty big I noticed I got big ears


 But wont work people small ears


 Dont get wrong best headset I ever purchased people going work out


 The main reason I bought compact size OPTIONAL ear hook


 I cant stand look hook course I dont use biggest persuasion buy it


The battery life great


 I talk hours I still havent killed battery one days usage yet


 Another thing loud gets


 I dont know I blackberry 8310 pretty loud I dont say WHAT? CAN U REPEAT THAT? EXCUSE ME? Like others I have


 So I would recommend people big ears small ears


 Just know problem using this
 

After first experience bluetooth headset, Jabra BT500, didn't use one 2 years
 Once California passed handsfree driving law, decided give another shot
I picked one it's Nokia, could use chargers Nokia phones
 It also looked nice
It fits well ear well adjustable
 The volume alot better old one connect quicker, 

Item well design comfortable wear
 It's big on/off button difficult use unless take ear
 The loop comes seems sturdy comfortable
 I've headset month encountered problems
 

The bluetooh delivered record time, hassle works great
 I love able hang neck cord clip provided, it's handy feature
 

This Nokia blietooth headset best
 I owned almost 6 months can't complain it, even friends liked much made order (from amazon)
Just get headset wont regret
There 10 star rating I'd rate 10 starts


 lol 

I bought headset nokia n95, shipping complications, delivered original nokia packaging described
 It linked quickly without issue, that's pretty much good ended
 The headset nothing static unless phone within foot earpiece
 If keep phone pocket, forget it
 Keep lookin


 

One main advantages Nokia BH-700 earpiece goes ear hangs it
 The headset comfortable used without optional hook; won't fall unless run jump down
 It small light
 The sound quality good
 Using buttons headset answer, reject, end calls, adjust volume, mute microphone, redial last number, transfer call headset handset, use voice commands
 The small LED uses different colors indicate device status
 If newer Nokia phone, use charger headset
 The battery lasts days
 The headset supports Bluetooth 2
0 + EDR, phone also capability, expect even better talk standby times
I've found two minor issues headset, which, however, don't detract stars rating
 First, headset beep battery gets low call; simply turns without warning completely discharged
 Second, buttons need pressed headset order pair it, means anyone 30' range pair devices headset, disconnect phone, delete pairing
 I doubt anyone actually experience this, I think security flaw
 Otherwise, really one best headsets market
 

I motorola H700 broke six months
 This Nokia dramatically improved range without breaking up, I leave living room walk around without carrying cell, better yet use skype couch
 The ear design helps hear cuts outside noise, however optional loop necessary keep slipping out
 The lanyard lets wear around neck easy access
 I like simple styling even though looks like thumb drive grabbing ear dear life
 Overall great design
 

I received headset today, I disappointed
 The ear piece big, fit ear all
 When I manage shove/wiggle around get stay in, it's uncomfortable, ear hurts well taking out
 Apparently headset sized men (I average sized woman)
 The included earloop sucks, doesn't much help fit either since cannot "mold" loop custom fit
 It's rigid plastic hook
On plus side, styling headset great
 Lightweight, sleek, controls easy use, obnoxious blinking blue light side head
 The neck lanyard nice touch too
 I make calls using unit, reception extremely clear
 

Really pleased product - reading ratings reviews brands, I ended Nokia, make phone, little expensive, I wanted make sure would pair really well
It half weight bluetooth products sound quality amazing
 People end hear fine too
 Most time I forget I'm wearing it
 I drive lot job live state hands free operation behind wheel mandatory
 I figured one traffic ticket fine would pay it
One thing could improved - on/off switch isn't easy operate could be, least can't switch accident way
 

The ear piece impossible fit ear
 It's way big hangs outside
 I cannot rely hook fix ear
 It's way loose practically decorative
 I think it's mostly designed men
 

After lot research I bought BH700 bluetooth headset
 I high hopes NOKIA product I big fan NOKIA Phones
 I disappointed fit headset, I think made people big ear canal
 The earbud fit securly small ear (with without loop)
 The bulk box product come extra earbuds (I sure complete box comes not) bad fit I get another one
 It great sound quality nothing world
 I bought Jabra BT8040 best fitting in-ear headset I ever seen
 

I returned week I got it
 Although sound quality good, ear bud big, got painful ( I wear constantly) fell lot
 The earloop useless
 I also like answer/end button right side ear bud, I would (inevitably ) go readjust it, I would accidentally either call hang someone



 I'm shopping something better

 bad, I've always sworn Nokia
 

thing great
 could use bigger power button, perfect every way
 fairly large ear knob, allows sit well outside inner ear canal, doesn't get waxy nasty won't fall even ear loop isn't used
 sound mic ear great, connection works perfect nokia 6126
 6126 didn't work correctly moto h850, didn't like, supposed made work nokia bh800
 guess upgrading thought simple standard bluetooth
 anyways thing absolute perfection phone, get one unless nokia supposed paired bh800 - check nokia site see recommend phone
 

This best Bluetooth headset I ever owned; easy set use
 The voice quality great wind causes issues w/ heard
 

1
 I decided switch Jabra Nokia why?2
 May07 Purchased JX10; 2 problems; first one charge; need charge one day-talked time around 20 minutes
 The dealer changed it
 The second one 6 months accepted charge
3
 I understand warranty 2 years
4
 So, I decided switch Nokia gave chance find brands5
 I agree BH-700 security pairing different I used to
6
 As I purchased Nokia two days so, need wait one month give full opinion
 But first impression within two days calls went smooth without received comments partners7
I using ear hook; comfortable 






























I love series Krusell
This case fitted well case
It cover external connectors
 










Nokia making two versions phone, E61 E62
 The difference E61 capable wireless LAN CDMA connectivity, whereas E62 not
 Otherwise, exactly same
Now, review
 I've several cell phones different manufacturers
 My first cell phone Nokia (and 8 years old, still would make great phone today
)
 I since tried Motorola, Samsung, Sony-Ericsson (I consider latter worst bunch)
 My last phone Nokia 6600 I wanted upgrade, I tried latest-and-greatest Samsung t-809
 I sorely disappointed purchase, promptly returned (you read review Amazon), I started looking phones (at time) sold directly US
 The Nokia E61 savior - E61 PERFECT phone I ever used
Why I like it? Number one - it's NOKIA
 I think Nokia perfected user interface
 If you've owned Nokia before, transition easy many things carried over
 You also like easy transfer everything old Nokia new one (go nokiaUSA website search "phone-to-phone transfer")
 The way phone book setup better others
 Nokias, general, use adapter
Number two - it's smartphone
 That means upgrade software, download new applications, personalize themes
Number three - QUAD band
 I travel lot I need feature
 In general, two frequency bands used GSM services US (850 1900)
 Two different frequency bands used GSM services elsewhere world (900 1800)
 A phone works one frequency band unfortunately also work frequency band next unless added specific extra frequency band
 Ideally, you'd want phone work four bands - commonly called quad-band phone
 But still rare expensive
 If choosing tri-band phone second best choice, careful three bands phone has
 In US, many rural areas served 850 band (because signal travels further)
 Some tri-band phones 900/1800/1900 people wonder get poor service cities (mostly rural) US
Number four - connectivity options available
 WiFi, EDGE, GPRS, 3G
 Sign data plan provider (cheapest T-Mobile) surf net 128kbps anywhere there's cell service
 Or use Wifi network surf free wherever there's wireless g signal
 You even use WiFi feature use phone VOIP provider (such Vonage)
 Lots HowardForums
 And particular feature scaring US telecoms - hence lack WiFi US-destined E62 version
 3G available US, rage Japan (blazingly fast downloads - even enough VIDEOS
)
 The E61 also supports CDMA connectivity, although absent E62
 That really won't affect US GSM users much - far I know
Number five - push email
 This means set like BlackBerry E61 notify everytime get email
 The software provided phone makes easy
 If need help, search "E61 forum" - lots helpful people
Number six - NO CAMERA
 This advantage
 I never used prior cell phone cameras
 Their presence phone serves make bulky expensive
 Eventhough camera, still upload pictures use wallpaper picture caller-ID - use bluetooth WiFi
More good stuff;7
 Bluetooth works great
8
 Screen looks good, even daylight
 It doesn't high resolution latest Palm Treo, believe me, 65K enough
9
 You add memory miniSD card - don't remove battery change cards
 I've already used 1GB Kingston miniSD card worked fine
10
 The charger uses (which works 100-240V) uses smaller plug previous Nokias, E61 comes short adapter allows use old charger
 I wish Sony Samsung would remember this
11
 The buttons nicely configured easy type (not small, flat - right)
 Someone invariably write review saying phone wide
 I don't understand people this? It business phone full keyboard layout - expect? If don't need full keyboard, don't get phone
 IT definitely thinner you'd expect though
12
 Battery life pretty good
 When I use phone, I go three days without recharging
 Using wireless services drop battery life pretty quick
 In general, I charge every night
13
 Case brushed aluminum magnesium-alloy back
 Fingerprints show like shiny Samsung t-809
 Feels sturdy hand too
 I wouldn't drop it, though, screen pretty big
14
 Speakerphone works nicely
 Loud
 Single button switchover speakerphone call (I don't know Samsung thnking hiding menu)15
 You use MP3 player even assign MP3s ringtones
 You want truncate MP3s 20 seconds less though play much looping
 Having would waste memory - unless still want keep song listen whol ething using media player (included software package)
Anyway, said, things aren't "perfect"
 Using Wifi slower expected
 While connected "g" network, don't get speeds higher dial-up
 Connect using EDGE though, you're good go (but requires data plan service provider)
 Also, phone uses Symbian software - that's great BUT able use readily available Palm WinCE applications
 To sync Outlook work, I call computer department give privileges install special Nokia syncing software
 It works great, little hassle
Also, find difficult use phone numbers based letters, ie 1-800-CALL-ME (or whatever)
 This keyboard layout, letters QWERTY fashion, numbers keys take center spots
 Not big deal me, I'm sure there's software available (or soon be) use onscreen guide
 That's beauty smartphone
This business phone, don't expect lot games
 It came preinstalled Golf game
 No Snake
 Part reason I love Nokias snake game
 I'll get around downloading sooner later
Another thing (which Noia already addressed advanced phones priced-like-a-computer N91) input regular headsets
 This means want listen MP3s, you'll use single-ear headset included phone
 They might double-ear (stereo) headset available phone gets popular)
All all, I think great phone
 It gives almost everything I want none I don't want
 I wish could accept standard headsets
 It's keeper
I hope review helpful
 

Looking smartphone replace Motorola L7 Palm V combination, I bought phone (1) WiFi, (2) QWERTY keyboard, (3) good cellphone features I appreciate Nokia (battery life, call quality, etc
)
 First, let say I return problem home electricity - seems european multi-voltage charger couldn't generate enough voltage low 109VAC charge phone
 This reported others, apparently pretty rare
 Unfortunately, deal-breaker me
 Strangely enough, phone initial charge fine, would never charge again
But 4 days I used phone, I quite impressed
 It really outstanding product, thing else market everything (and more, fact) HP iPaq 69xx, new know much about
 I would generally agree glowing reviews already written, I won't repeat everything they've said - it's pretty much true
 But coming Palm PDA experience, I somewhat disappointed PDA capabilities phone
For example, search capability
 OK, File Manager allows search material that's control, doesn't include phone's contacts, notes, calendar/ToDo apps - things need search
 There's decent search application sept-solutions
de, can't search notes - serious limitation me
Next, sync can't use many phone number fields Outlook
 For example, I sync'ed Palm Outlook, many entries use "Main" phone number
 Outlook got fine, Nokia PC Suite couldn't sync phone
 A real nuisance
 A simple remapping setting sync could eventually solve this, now, I'm luck
Next, categories phone's applications
 The nice AquaCalendar 3rd party application allows assign categories calendar items (including tasks), aren't transfered sync Outlook
 Personally, I can't see anyone could survive without categories tasks, notes, contacts (not mention calendar, Palm doesn't that, either)
 The E61 contact groups essentially categories, don't seem get transfered sync
Another problem I never found solution Palm several hundred items ToDo list, undated
 Outlook undated tasks, seems E61 - assigned day I sync'ed
 And many calendar app handle without getting memory full
 So basically way transfer ToDo list
Yet another problem can't attach notes calendar, task, contact entries
 This deal-breaker me
 AquaCalendar allow notes ("descriptions") calendar entries, it's nearly useful what's Palm
Another problem want change date calendar entry, simply go date that's couple months away, don't get nice month view way Palm's calendar app
 It's quite nuisance scroll guess correct going setting date that's far future
Finally, another show-stopper me, I use PocketQuicken Palm
 This outstanding app also available Windows phones, work iPaq, I haven't found anything good Symbian J2ME platforms
 A nice free app, JabpLite, seems like would trick, I've never managed get read QIFs Quicken slow bluetooth file transfer
In summary, want truly outstanding smartphone (without camera), E61 could easily best choice
 But you're expecting usability Palm-based device, you'd best look elsewhere
 The Treos might make good choice, don't WiFi (yet), phone, can't touch Nokia
 As iPaq, might trick, it's somewhat larger Nokia
 Motorola Q? Nice, also WiFi
 I haven't able check everything HTC, yet, last time I looked, didn't everything I looking for
 The perfect phone still doesn't exist, E61 sure raised bar
 

This first smartphone, expectations high, I give 3 stars
 It good performance, I used I cannot live without (but I would switch phone would solve "bugs")
Problems:1
 way connect wifi itself, use applications like (web, e-mail, etc)
 You connect wifi using application
2
 The phone freezes often, ctrl-alt-del even on-off button work, I remove battery restart phone
3
 Not lot software available Symbian OS
4
 For used Palm OS, basic applications sub-standardMaybe next version solve problems
 

First bat, comes GSM wireless space, nobody better Nokia cell phones
 Voice reception great always best class (as Nokia phones I experienced do
); nothing betters -- iphone, Motorola, Sony Ericsson etc
Most would read good things reviews they're lying
 But let's closer look "darker underbelly" monster (so speak)


MP3 MEDIA PLAYER:As know, phone plays MP3s accepts miniSD Card
 So I brandishing 1GB miniSD card ready first MP3 cell phone dreaming carrying hundreds songs pocket wherever I go 


 Perish thought
 Around time I upload 80 songs, phone starts going crazy; freezes try access media player play songs, music library's playlist keeps amnesia every need keep telling update playlist
 And ask scan storage update playlist 


 need go FOUR layers menu reach "update music library"
 And every day two find media player's playlist gone back either 0 7 songs playlist
At 80 songs, takes forever (ok, 20 minutes --- world would need 20 minutes update playlist???) update library
 The best I could manage 110 tracks playlist went week 


 would "happily" turn 95 them
 I seriously wonder *WHO* wrote software 


 latest version OS I downloaded Nokia website
Let's forget carrying video around
PICTURE GALLERY:Upload large picture 150KB size going major problem try access "Gallery" phone freezes least 5 minutes even get back main screen even pressing red "hang-up" button
 The solution --- wait 5 minutes, press "magic button" shut phone restart 


 wait sounds familiar (CTRL+ALT+DELETE anyone?) it's even MS-Windows
USER INTERFACE RESPONSIVENESS:The interface sluggish say least
 Access "Notes" takes least good 1 sec open notes application
 I know must saying "1 sec? What's bad superman?" The point light weight application (and using phone) expect things instantaneous --- newbie may think he/she didn't press button might even press harder second time (I quite times) 


 I live 
 (Can't all?)THE MUCH TOUTED SKYPE SUPPORT:It's hyped nothing like leads believe
 You don't save money anyway doesn't support VOIP skype Wifi
 All allows initiate skype call computer cell phone want make long distance call cell using skype (most probably international since cell phones domestic long distance anyways) --- either ways don't save money spend airtime receiving skype call (if it's weekend/night time-band) don't need it's weekend/nights get free airtime anyways
 Besides, need "skype-out" account entails $30 annual subscription fee
I haven't tried VOIP features it's paid subscription service
1-800-DIAL-A-WORD:The ugly side QWERTY keyboard it's hard dial number listed 1-800-ACME-HELP since letters set differently
 Ergo, always need numeric version you'll work great thing you're hurry frequent attacks brain-fade
WISH:I wish support stereo Bluetooth headphones
CONCLUSION:Why I stick it, 3 stars? Because good job cell phone, Wifi support decent nothing complain about, it's got full browser (with RealPlayer support limited YouTube usage), full JavaScript support instead wimpy WML browser, usual battery recharge every 3 4 days unless you're love terribly home-sick --- might recharge every single day would least problem get monthly statement (but I digress
)
 

well I got phone sticking Motorola V710 year, phone arrived without hitch
 [


]
one concern I phone following several people forums even amazon complaining phone charging properly honestly worried I risking quite large sum money product, hard honest research I found issue is, currently another motorola phone one it's power adapter, e61 uses smaller sized tip adapter power brings adapter use old power adapter please DONT this, since newer phone e61 uses bit power get charged older charges dont provide enought power (juice) this
 Now everything lost don't go buying separate adapter nokia e61 also includes correct type adapter phone one I bought amazon brought converter wall outlet, due fact phone europe funky 2 rounded prong connector, swing local radioschack get adapter would work without hitch
 also getting original accesories purchase Nokia AC-4U Travel Charger works great phone
 My phone gives 4 5 days charge depending use lot read LOT Motorola phones I've had
Highly recommended, Wi-FI works great lot great apps really cheap
 

got phone MCO pretty low priceit 3 branded, fw pretty old (1
x), changed product code Hong Kong version update, phone alot stable, however, symbol layout keyboard changed, I make sticky back show difference (be aware want change language)the screen big, landscape mode, I pretty impressed pleasant browsing internet big screenthe keypad pretty pleasant key message, joystick easier use, email button also handy checking email (it supports regular POP secure US Army IMAP, doesn't support GMail IMAP)reception kinda weak, gym locker room, I make/receive calls N73, E61 shows nothingthanks 1500mA/h battery, battery time par N73no cam included may plus using high secure precinct (where cam prohibited), I use instead N73like S60 phones, retrive WAP/MMS setting right SIM, except special setting (I VPN total internet, I put separate APN setting net browser, realplayer, tethering)bt version 1
2, slow side, I get 500kbps transferring files, I got 1200kbps N73some special tips: go tools->application manager->options->settings->software installation, use (default signed only, prevents non-nokia application installation)conclusion: phone pretty low price now, get use messaging alot use alot internet phone, won't disappoint you; decide change product code change language, aware symbol keyboard changed 

One best phones I usedPros: The wi-fi good, big screen, good visibility colour resolution also help functions really great
Cons: Some downloaded games, freezes phone bulky 

While phone bit bulky


 I like it's top functionality
Very easy sync, bluetooth enabled


 Wifi
 The built email manager it's best use Gmail, Gmail makes available nice application solves issue
 

Great phone, don't buy here
 You'll save hundred bucks order online directly Nokia
 And free second day shipping
 

I got Nokia E61 two weeks ago 
 At beginning looked complex soon I realize helpful tool manage daily tasks
It smartphone difficult master function withoutsome readings build-in Tutorial useful
I enjoy much smartphone small computer phone I recommand warmly
Ing
 Dragu Stanescu 

Finally I got phone truly everthing
 The MP3 playback great audio quality, office apps great
 WiFi great save money easy setup
 And screen best one I seen handheld device
 

I used phone, pockets pc kind stuff, I tell little piece created Nokia daily job easier
I amazed features phone has
 To replacement little laptop
 

1
 It never successfully connected internet sent email via using wifi wlan
2
 It generic text editor used open text file different file type qualifiers, 
cpp 
java file without first needing rename program files 
txt file
3
 The editors phone "Save As" option rather primitive
Maybe Nonia simply care users need? 

I business executive heavy user PDAs
 I satisfied Sony Clies Palms I owned along life
 The Symbian system used several phone manufacturers EXTREMELY LIMITED terms program availability
Regardless Nokia's marketing E61 state art telephones, concerned FULL CAPABILITIES may offer
 For device claims supportive executives, lacks programs productivity even games (yes, executives like good games too), common assorted Palm OS products
I sorry I won't able exchange device moment, since I bought it
What poor deal
 

If "reviewer" Scott Lingren really works Nokia Director Product Marketing, I comments him:1
 The astroturf-like "review" (quotes intentional required) E62, yet posted E61 product page
 Lame you, Mister Marketing Flack
2
 If you're going "astroturf" (not exactly right term, it's close enough), could least make slightest attempt make "review" sound like something marketing flack's press release? Lame again, Mister Marketing Flack
We return regularly scheduled reviews
 Thanks reading, fellow Amazonians
Disclaimer: I tested E61
 I rated E61 4 stars, I leave rating
 Based analysis current reviews, probably merits 4 star rating
 






The battery charger doesn't work anymore, light current flowing through, I test cell phone another charger friend, fine
It bad
 



















































































Just received one mail today
 It's original Nokia battery right, plenty marks scrataches over
 Terminals look used
 The 3-yr old battery I bought replace better condition
 

Thanks requesting input, Amazon
com
I purchased two batteries I could carry charged spare me
 That good thing because, combined, two batteries don't even last long battery intended replace
 I write "intended" I kept old battery I rotate them
 They even look like OEM batteries


so sad
 

I ordered battery replace battery cell phone that's 5+ years old
 The battery shipped right away arrived small bubble pack
 It's labelled exactly one replacing, popped right in, works perfectly
 No apparent change battery life, charging functions, etc
 

So far good, battery par like original one, though I make point remove charger battery full, that's probably caused damage old battery
 

I bought battery replace battery seemed causing problems Nokia N80 works great
 I really can't say more
 A++++++ 

















I bought battery Nokia 6010 cell phone I understood risk associated purchase
 Some people complain new battery work better old one
 Maybe something battery shelf life
 However, I lucky: battery really new battery, works exactly way original one worked new - stand-by time etc
 Highly recommended


 

This battery saved buying new phone I didn't want do

 The I got immediate shipping



 Great service
 Thanks



 

It easy order item it's working great ever since
 The price reasonable delivery time didn't take long all

 I will, however, certainly consider guys future weird battery needs
 

The initial battery ordered proved dective would take charge
 I ntified company supplied battery immediately sent replacement functions satisfactorily
 I would business company again
 RDH 

batteries I received plastic bags, none matched far logos went, last maybe 2 days without charge, one even last day, I first go phone would go 6 8 days without charge first year

my understanding I buying new


but looking closely something else

 

This perfect fit phone
 I've looking locally replacement luck
 Don't know I didn't try sooner
 

I scratching head trying figure buy replacement battery ancient cell phone
 After many unsuccessful attempts various cellular stores I directed go online continue search
 In first five minutes I ordered replacement battery within three days delivered
 I definitely order again
 It easy, fast, completely reliable
 

Excellent quality oem batteries old Nokia phones
 It's like new phones again
 They Go days without needing charge

34,) got negative reviews
 Radio shack wanted $53+ shipping tax exact battery

 They're products best, excellent service friendly talk to
 This second order conpany many need arises
 Check out
 You won't sorry
 

cycles get 5-7 days charge great value, make sure cycle battery's wont hold charge long
 

My battery OEM Nokia
 Quick delivery
 Battery held charge well three weeks I owned it
 

Great Supplier quick shipment
 Battery works well advertised
 I use vendor again
 

These batteries getting harder harder find
 Though Nokia branded, batteries I ordered CCM Accessories come original manufacturer's packaging
 After day two use, I noticed hold charge
 They would go fully charged nearly empty short span time, sometimes phone would unexpectedly turn off
 This happened batteries I ordered CCM Accessories
It's past return period, unfortunately I stuck loss
 But I writing review let know need stuck
 Stay away
 

I lost old Nokia cell phone recently found again
 The battery course shot
 I looked AT&T; store wanted $35 one battery
I googled battery type Amazon popped up
 I skeptical price($2
75) I looked product description I saw price drop Oct
 year
 Because price I ordered 2 along new charger
 What great suprise find work good old one
I battries charger within week ordering
Couldnt happier
 

This one kind item longevity overriding factor determine everything be
That said, battery inexpensive, actually cheaper cost shipping - spare ordered kept charged swap needed
The battery marked original factory part number, I recall correctly, bar code close exact too
 However, holographic sticker like original certify genuine
In short - work, seem constructed identically reason suspect close scrutiny knock-offs
 I'd call good deal money, but, stated first paragraph, way know worth using see still work year (and course, can't wait year still post review


)
I gave product 5 stars pricing apparent construction quality
 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
All I say NOKIA charges $40
I've replaced batteries BOTH NokiaCell Phones keep charge aslong original fraction cost
 

The battery works like old one got water damaged, I could tell used battery, observations mainly based upon wear marks consistent routine movement
 But phone longer made I can't complain
 My old tried true Nokia 6125 works again
 

I ordered four them
 Two worked perfectly fine
One worked poorely first two charge cycles (very short charged time),but worked fine ever since
The last four one short cycle charge would take ANY charge that
I e-mailed vendor got response (waited week)
I returned item per written instructions; pay postage I waited
While waiting I another item I purchased elsewhere test defective (I buy LOT stuff)
I e-mailed them
 I got response next day
They sent replacement prepaid shipping pay return defective item
I received item rapidly 



 still WAITING first vendor even respond
I e-mailed - telling story OTHER VENDOR knows treat customer
They FINALLY responded e-mail said replacement "on way"
I received shortly 


MUCH LONGER wait OTHER VENDOR I pay postage return defective item;adding cost purchase (no comment apology, nothing)
Thought would like know
I many batteries buy 


I use huge number gadgets 


Guess MY plans are???{Did review help decide?} 

I ordered battery behalf father would pay new phone somewhat dated, suits needs fine
 The price even shipping worth go hassle new phone contract
The replacement battery shipped expected timeframe
 Unfortunately completely dead would charge
 My father e-mailed informing problem probably wasted $3 change shipping bad battery back
 In end recieved another battery amount time seems work fine
I say it's hassle defective product sent you, fact item replaced rather painlessly deserves another shot business
 

What I say, price beats heck Radio Shack
 

I old 3310 nokia phone I love dearly, I excited find replacement batteries it
 However; ordering batteries took forever delivered I disappointed service, contact sellers twice it
 Not discourage though, price good seem working fine
 

The battery (2) Nokia phones received I opened them, noticed Nokia Hologram older batteries had
 This made suspect original Nokia batteries
 After installing them, one works okay (hours recharge) other, power lasts day, two most

Only time tell
[ASIN:B0006HP7NW Nokia BLC-2 Standard Battery Nokia 1260, 1261, 2260, 3310, 3360, 3361, 3390, 3395, 3560, 3570, 3585, 3586i, 3588i, 3589i, 3590, 3595, 6010, 6651, 6800, 6810]] 

I wouldn't buy this
I ordered one Nokia BLC-2 3
6V batteries Nokia 3595 phone Amazon old battery's charge wasn't lasting long
 The new one says "Made Japan" looks new won't hold charge, even using original Nokia charge device Nokia ACP-7U
 This charger puts 700 milliamps lower, gentler charge
 A new Nokia BLC2 battery initially go 3 deep-cycle charge/discharge cycles later take 3
5 hours charge
 Mine didn't charge all
I'm back using old battery now
 I'm sure well charger unit needs function new battery chargeable ACP-7 especially since old battery still takes charge unit prescribed time
It may hard manufacturers maintain old LiIon batteries normal battery degradation poor useless
 The degradation graceful
Wonder safe too
 There's safety agency marking -- UL, ETL, CSA, TUV, CE, Asian agencies
 

This old Nokia phone whose battery would longer hold charge
 The new battery came fully charged I able use immediately
 It lasted quite days took full charge
 I'm pleased, especially price
 

The replacement battery cell phone- Nokia BLC-2, arrived ahead projected delivery time, easy install necessary first charge worked required
 

This Nokia battery works well phone I needed this
 It affordable easy buy Amazon
com
 

I received defective battery BluetoothPlus offered multiple solutions

If need replace battery older Nokia, don't mess around cheap batteries sold
 Go original Nokia battery still packaging, like one

 Not one scrap life left it, matter long charge for
 I'm going bother returning even complaining shysters myself; going pony buy fresh new one
 They suck it

Good product, Great price

 sorry 

This battery holding great, however, I long I don't use cell much
So far, good

 

Battery works great used couple weeks son bought newer cell phone Christmas
 

My Nokia cell phone 5 years old still works good, battery life steadily getting worse, I decided go new battery instead much expensive new phone
 So I know trying make sure get new battery old used piece crap
1)If dont want spend around $10 new battery dont continue read review
2)there 3 listings battery amazon
 one 30 reviews, next 16 reviews third 5 reviews
 first listing 30 reviews battery failure rate 33 percent
 second listing 16 reviews battery failure rate 50 percent, third listing one 2 star rating 5 reveiews
3) prices, listing 30 reciews price range $5
53 $9
19, second listing 16 reviews price range $6
67 $9
19 third listing 5 reviews price range $7
98 $14
08
4) I paid $10
68 battery retail price stores ranges $18 $30, still better deal amazon, battery listed "brand new retail package"(sold CCM ACCESSORIES)and received battery, UN-OPENED "Nokia Original accessories" package
 besides original nokia package, else know battery new? If look pictures batteries listed, say made japan, original battery says "made china" brand new battery received also made china, cant get original that


5)so old saying says, "you get pay for" works again, maybe able order cheaper battery, may work great, run risk fail, like bad reviews read about


So far battery working really good










 

The battery defective hold charge
 I notified Deals Warehouse three different emails finally said would replace defective battery never did
I could possibly dissatisfied purchase
 

This battery would fully charge
 I purchased two batteries neither would fully charge even placed charger night
 I dissatified
 

This battery defective & requested refund
AMAZON, please get involed matter remedied quickly

Thanks, Michael Farrell 

I'm seeing difference battery life old battery new one
 I don't know I phone problem new battery really old one
 I've using new battery month
 What I'm really wondering whether battery exceeded shelf life that's it's offered low price
 

The battery doesn't hold charge hour use planning get new phone since one I several years old
 

The reason I bought battery phone broke (dropped toilet


yeah, know) phone I could get hold old nokia phone
 Sad thing I'm due upgrade I hate free phones Tmobile currently offering I find non-free phones way expensive
As far battery goes, dies within 2-3 days
 Pretty sad considering nothing nokia phone draining battery life (no camera, mp3 player, nothing)
 Still it's better phone w/ battery, suppose
 

Battery arrived marks contacts won't hold charge 4 hours stand-by fifteen minutes talk time
 Got easy refund, email half-apologizing "the battery sent brand new although due older version phone batteries manufactured sometime ago tend lose talk time" call effect well
 Best bother this, get factory-new battery need one
 

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
ITS A PIECE OF JUNK
I SPENT 5
98 FOR NOTHING
I WAS SO AGGRAVATED,I JUST THREW IT AWAY
BUYER BEWARE, IF IT SAYS SHIPPED FROM WEBTREO,DO NOT BUY
IT WAS NOT A NEW BATTERY
IT WOULDNT EVEN TURN ON THE CELL
EVEN AFTER I CHARGED IT
NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER


 

This battery would take charge
 Neither AC home charger DC car charger would charge it
 

Love new batteries old batteries would last day without charged
 New ones last least two days depending usage
 Saved day
 Now I one phone one backup
 Thanks For great product
 Shawn

This battery says made China
 No Nokia hologram it
 Runs 30% time original battery did
 Not happy
 

It's really hard review product I haven't used yet
 This spare battery MP3-4-5 player purchased wife Christmas
 Sorry I can't say anymore product
 I received promptly brand new condition
 

great battery great company sold battery
 Thanks
 Phone works great new battery
 Thanks again
 

I never recived iteam, I order another one cost twice amount money
 

For less two bucks I expecting cheap knock-off would hold charge five minutes, especially given "mixed" reviews replacement phone batteries
 Instead I got appears new Nokia OEM battery holds charge week, depending upon usage course
 The battery hologram "scratch off" actually code number, X762U6A anyone interested bird-dogging it, stamped hologram
 So perhaps Nokia changed way code replacement batteries
 Or not, gives crap, ATT store Batteries Plus wanted ream I buy twenty these, counting shipping course
 If I complain anything I paid almost three bucks ship item costs less two bucks
 But packaging good (almost good, I hell time getting it) arrived timely fashion
 So less five bucks I good battery back phone
 Which good phone talking, much better POS Blackberry, everything sounds like coming barrel drops calls week Nokia dropped five years
P
S
 I guess I note I purchased item AccessoryOne
 It seems item gets bounced around vendor vendor experience may different mine due purchased battery different vendor
 Could possiblly account wide variations experiences various customers appears, surface least, item?? 

I bought BL-5C Amazon twice, I didn't pay attention supplier
 This product came Just Cellular
 It came wrapped plain sleeve
 The battery Nokia markings labelled Made Japan
 I watch see much life I get it
I bought others Amazon, wrapped sealed bag, bar coded, date 09/08/2011
 The battery marked "cell made Korea furhter processing China"
 The battery Nokia hologram
I draw two possible conclusions: 1) Just Cellular battery fake, (2) Just Cellular old stock
 Neither brightens day
 

batteries arrived well delivery date & advertised great price( shipping item)
 I charged & fully discharged them
 I've used month & working well
 

There many different sellers Amazon selling supposed exact battery
 I bought one Amazon 10 bucks, happy
 Though cost buying sellers, frankly it's still reasonable
The battery came simple plastic sleeve I bit alarmed first, looked new, clean scratches Nokia hologram sticker looked genuine (to read Nokia's explanation this, search using "nokia genuine battery", unfortunately seems amazon doesn't want provide direct link)
And importantly, right it's old Nokia 6600 used 2G calling while, holds charges several days (not one day)
And reviewers, thank much writing sellers' name explicitly review
 I hope others follow, like "I bought seller XXX worked (or didn't work)"
 That way, eventually know seller better others providing genuine, new, good batteries
 

Very disappointed
I got old battery, was4-5 years old, seemed going
 It went holding charge 8-10 days - light usage standby - holding charge three days usage
I bought one
 It came promptly seemed okay, though I didn't look closely
 It holds charge three days (very) light usage standby
I waited awhile write review, tiny note tiny tag says may require three charges reaches maximum capacity
 Well, four five charges (charging now, Thurs
 afternoon charged Sunday night) it's still deal
 Three days, almost calling
As I said, disappointed
 I'm going write seller tonight, see respond
 

I purchased one OEM supposed new, came open plastic sleeve
 It almost zero capacity, lasts 2 hours charging full overnight
 

I purchased friend fear might real thing able hold charge turned-out GREAT battery price shipping almost good true
 Thanks Amazon Vendor
 

Bought factory battery wasn't lasting long couple years
 Don't remember exactly long factory one lasted new, one generally good 2 days average talk time
 Much cheaper buy battery get new phone
 

Got timely mannor, put phone, chatged 12+ hours nothing 
 Never worked 
 Annoyed say least 
 I ordered time go hospital ce section wouldnt charge phone often considering bending painfull
 A lot good me
 

Bought one $5 Accessory One one barely held charge
 Tried $10 one Amazon LLC I'm getting 24 hours
 So it's split review, really depends get good one bad one
I first bought battery $5 Amazon vendor Accessory One one barely held charge (2-3 hrs total idle time IPEVO Skype Phone)
 But I started reading reviews people saying batteries could reconditioned "bad apples" bunch
 I ended buying one $10 sold Amazon LLC directly conditioning battery (letting charge full leave battery drain, charge full - rinse repeat 1 2 times) I'm consistently getting full day battery
 That's like it
 I can't say whether one Accessory One reconditioned battery sure bad one bunch
 It's call vendor want buy from
 

I bought item it's orginal Nokia battery
 My previous one also Nokia lasted several years
 It'll work well five days single charge standby mode calls
 

Was problems old battery old phone


this trick
 I could talk 10 minutes phone would die
 I received replacement battery charged full disconnected let sit standby
 It appears new far cosmetically
 I several short calls battery seams working/holding charge should
 For price anything better was


time tell holds up
 

This battery seems fine replacement
 However, batteries cannot fully judged one used quite time
 It appears battery Nokia ought perform fine, 

purchase product suppose new got very, old battery , scrathes , dont purchase 

bought two extra battery changed even genuine one
 batteries hold charge well
 satisfied
 great product great price 

Works great fit like supposed to, charges recharges quickly
 When I need another one I come back order another 

It's OK product
 It took get here
 product charging best new battery
 

Amazing


 Im sad


 My battery working properly
 It seems used battery


When I bought it, I thought would big hit

 But not
 

I old phone original battery
 I hoped keep going I really like phone
 I bought new extended life battery expecting give lot longer use charges
 Not going well I expected
 It somewhat better
 

I little skeptical buying product mixed reviews web site
 I concerned return address individual rather company, met expectations
 The price great, arrived quickly partially charged
 We charged fully held charge problem

An excellent transaction far I'm concerned 

Very frustrated Amazon's marketing product
 I noticed charger auto plug cents I opted three items
 I realized I would charged shipping two items since different seller
 Although noted different seller click details see would charged separate shipping each
 I caught day ordered still able cancel it
 When initial product free shipping assume two free also
 This practice changed
 It clearly deceptive way amazon sellers make money shipping items hard impossible sell
 Fix Amazon
 

Unfortunately, I ordered battery guided good reviews has
 I urgently need one since one cellphone longer holding charge
If read "In Stock", means "Not available, Not Sure be


" AccessoryOne (the worst vendor I seen Amazon 5 years)
So, I wait reimbursement I buy one another vendor actually one stock, fairy dust sell
 

When see Nokia battery low price, probably wonder it's genuine
 I sure did
I bought two
 The holograms check out, serial numbers scratch codes unique
 As far I tell, genuine batteries
Having said that, battery slightly smaller old battery, slightly loose camera
 Also, got rather hot charging
I'll check battery life soon; I haven't updated this, battery life must okay
 If anything add, comment review
 

el envio llego antes de la fecha, el bateria funciona bien y sin ningun problemas

I unlocked european mobile needed help- ordered came quickly successfully saved phone
 

The Nokia battery performed greatly since I received replaced battery come phone
 I've problems whatsoever new Nokia
 

My old battery longer held charge, I found these
 Bought 3 original price one
I charge take fishing camping trips electricty charger
I instant coverage whenever I want make call don`t worry battery life
 

I bought battery May 2011 via Amazon "The OEM Shop
" The battery completely failed less month would longer take charge
 I suspect battery reconditioned rather new
 Needless say, I wasted money
 

It works fine hasn't given indication it's fully functioning battery
 My concern it's completely brand new
 The hologram battery tiny scratches didn't come Nokia brand packaging (although previous one I purchased did)
 This one came little resealed pouch
 Also electric receivers look like it's another component wear metal
 Regardless, it's good price hasn't discharged quickly
 Hopefully won't that's matters
 

I ordered battery everything seemed fine
 However, I never receieved package days estimated arrival, I contacted company
 At point, "said" package must lost mail, would resend product
 The next day I received another email saying product longer stock
 If DONT it, SHOULDNT post sale blame mail somone call's out
 I NOT using company again
From reviews, seems like either good company horrible one, middle ground
 

I ordered two these
 They different other
 I'm sure actual Nokia products not
 They work
 

I went 3 batteries Nokia none held charge day several texts couple minute calls:(Very weary trying another I don't want part old phone
 

I changed phone 22 December 2012, Jan 1 2013 battery half, I still can't believe it, I haven't used since charged it's since then
 I amazed long lasting
 This battery well built
 

After searching searching battery baby monitor -- Levana BABYVIEW20, I found uses Nokia battery
 I nervous buy type product seller Amazon
 I works fits perfectly
 

After looking replacement battery older mobile phone I concerned many people complained receiving apparent old, used battery wouldn't hold charge
 I found batteries offered $5 places decided pay approx $15 amazon
 The battery I received working fine
 It holds charge least couple days
 I'm satisfied it
 

This battery replaced BL-5CA Nokia cell phone
 It extended use higher milliamp hour rating
 It size configuration original
 Nokia hologram intact
 I using several weeks now, lasts longer original new
Nokia BL-5C Extended Li-Ion Battery 

Bought 2 batteries "Best N Price" Dec 2011 genuine Nokia batteries Nokia name 3D logo battery
 I bought another 2 batteries little month later another vendor (Just Cellular) higher price first set
The batteries 'Just Cellular' Nokia name 3D logo battery - BL-5C
 

I got used battery bad shape long waiting
when get things market place, watch site
 

This great price original battery older phone
 It shipped right away too
 Just I needed
 

My old battery lasted five (5) years
 I wanted keep phone, I purchased replacement battery
 It holds charge almost two (2) weeks
 I think they're great batteries, I'm satisfied
 I wanted keep phone so; "If ain't broke, don't fix it"
 In others words replace battery
 

The item shipped quickly, fit perfectly worked great
 The phone works well again
 (I concerned getting used battery
 This seems new
 It works like new anyway
) 

I use 6555 internatioal travel phone
 It's unlocked, throw sim card don't worry much theft
I getting ready get rid it, since battery standby matter hours
 Found new one cheap Amazon difference
Stays charged standby days now, instead hours
 Highly recommended
 

These batteries, thought necessarily brand new, tested long lasting
 I pleased, Igot two good batteries small price
 

After 8 years using Nokia 6600, great see OEM batteries still available
 Instead charging day, I go back charging every 2-3 days
 Quick delivery Amazing Value
 

I use chinese knockoff phone nokia battery
 oem battery last legs, lasting day
 put one go 4-5 days recharge
 

It easy, fast, I like it
 I happy
 I complain
 Thanks
 

If want battery last 6 mths, go somewhere else
 This stupid thing doesn't hold charge anymore it's like company going stand product
 

I bought Amazon alternate batters GPS logger gets job done
 Its cheap worth price


 

Just I needed
 The old battery lasted 1 hour
 Now I go 2 days without charging
 

Upon close inspection, difficult accept item new BL-5C
 Rather, judging surface marks wear gold plated contacts, (in probability) came junked returned phone several different models use battery type
 A new battery would without marks wear sort packaging
 In opinion, item labeled "refurbished" "tested good"
 It's still good deal though item local BatteriesPlus store sells outlandish $37
99
 Functionality: The BL-5C I received took charge usual amount time using wall transformer supplied Nokia 1100 phone
 Left turned continuously 7-days, maintained it's expected voltage level
 Therefore, I saw noticeable difference item performance original
 However, batteries finite number charge/discharge cycles impossible tell many item date
 So, time tell real status it's condition
 My best educated guess work limited period time longer take charge
 

The life battery original battery I Nokia 6230
 Very satisfied
 


I bought go groove music box within couple weeks battery died me
 I replaced lights brighter

Very happy product
 Worked great old phone



I glad find battery
 Would definitely recommend product
 

The battery friend mine, needed battery camera, coincidently ended type battery
 

After years, original Nokia BLD-3 battery started lose capacity used Nokia 6200
 This new battery restored original battery life phone
 

I'm using rather old Nokia cellphone yes, that's "be phone
"I love old-model phone (to get model number I'd take battery lose presets) whenever I talk it, sounds like I'm hardwired, "Baby Bell" landline that's good sound quality is, sending receiving
 Indeed, either necessity I discover current cellphone sounds good, I'm keeping it
 (I'm second one, courtesy "eBay;" ringer finally died first one
)That said it's bit hard find new battery it; one I've purchased third one phone (which means 2nd one I've bought; phone obviously came one) purchased new, way back when
Standby power THREE DAYS new battery; I change whenever standby chargeability gets less 24 even 16 hours help me, takes LONG time; we're talking literally YEARS here
What relief fresh reliable power; OEM battery I guess good price certainly right vendor
 

A great price true OEM battery
 Able save older unlocked phone use UK Europe
 Hurray
 

Battery brand new, lasted one year now
Definitely recommended 





























































































































If hunting cell phone case older phone won't able purchase anywhere else
 I'm still trying return "generic" case Nokia
 It quick easy
 I admit I little concerned fit it's exactly I looking for
 Amazon great shopping tool
 











I bought item, said it's Nokia
 Well it's NOT
 You "play" plug hear heard
 The cord short, retractable feature work, microphone really bad
 

I bought ear piece use I driving car
 The first time went use it, "retractable" part chord broke apart


before I even got put ear
 So broke, I decided I would still use even though whole plastic part split
 It didn't even work
 The chord still intact sound coming earpiece
 I returned next day refund
 

I giving three star I read anywhere Nokia exclusive headset meaning 2
5mm phone adapter use it
 So ad seemed misleading me
 Other seems work fine
 
























































































































































































































































































































































































I'm using nokia 6133
 It slight pop it's bad models, doesn't hurt hears, sorta annoying
 Only thing I don't like plays mono
 On phone, even though adapter doesn't mic I don't unplug make call
 

The Nokia stereo earbuds leave lot desired
 With adapter, use earbuds audiophile headphones like
 I assure high bit-rate MP3s 6682 phone sounds GREAT Bose Triport headphones
 Highly recommended plan use Nokia regular, personal music listening device
 

I would give 5 stars loud popping sound heard whenever buttons pressed
 This absolutely awful makes adapter almost useless (it still usable keep playing tracks continuously)
 Believe not, problem happens lot people (google "ad-15 popping noise")Buy iPod instead
 

For deranged reason I wanted connect Nokia 6800a 3
5mm headset
 So I bought AD-15 slapped onto Nokia 6800a
 I must say adapter works
 Maybe great I hoped, well enough get sound Nokia 6800a
 Getting sound Nokia 6800a challenge, much less important getting sound out
 If still using Nokia handset pop-port option attach modern audio equipment
 

I still use old Nokia 6126 listen music I go jog I've using Nokia headset answering mechanism listen music
 The Nokia headset reliable music comes thru flat bass
 The main advantage answer calls speak headset
I recently came across Nokia headset adapter decided give try
 The item fit nicely Nokia phone using stereo headphone, music came thru rich vibrant, I really impressed
The main gripe cannot use headset answer calls
 The second minor gripe attachment port kind bulky(and puts unneccessy wieght wiring)
 But otherwise great accessory still using old Nokia model phones
 

After putting carrying around default Nokia headphones while, I finally got around buy accessory
The good side, get use favorite headphones Nokia
The good side, it's probably bit bigger needs (Nokia plug 3
5mm socket could've merged, I don't know)
It's good solution Nokias without 3
5mm socket
 One thing I've noticed ring tone go headphones, straight cellphone speaker
 It's probably good thing prevent going deaf, depending current ring tone selection
 

I really annoyed learn Nokia "music player" cell phone funky proprietary connection required adapter use standard ear phones
 However, item solved problem
 It still wrong Nokia produce products cannot used without optional accessories (a tidbit information leave selling phone), adapter inexpensive I nothing negative say seller product
 

What great accessory
 It simply plugs POP port I plug FM transmitter use MP3 player
 FM transmitters whole seem work good
 It would much better audio input car stereo, casette adapter, AD-15 works great, yes provide true stereo 

I Nokia 6126, headset adapter works beautifully
 The stereo quality good, although there's white noise probably design cell phone
 Construction good, I imagine one day wire connecting two pieces wear use become spotty, like headphone wires do
As warning Nokia's site mentions, use adapter listen calls, microphone disabled headphones plugged in
The thing better would Nokia open hardware anyone make adapter like this
 Unfortunately, want one making money them
 

I origionally ordered item internet two three bucksfrom CellPhoneShop , arrived real Kokia workand cheaply constructed , item buck real Nokia really worked 


 Excellent 

I personally find incredibly annoying Nokia feels need use proprietary headphone jack phones
 I already superlative pair Sennheiser portable headphones I use portable music player I own, pay inflated prices cruddy Nokia earbuds
This adapter small, well built exactly need do
 





































I bought case rather common nokia case protected soft faceplate phone
 In use though mixed blessing since cannot see screen see missed call message without removing case
 Another nit uses leather loop 2 snaps instead clip cannot slide belt
 

I really like case lot
 Because holds phone sideways (parallel waist), much less obtrusive anything else hang belt
 I also like fact case hooked belt without taking belt attaches using wide loop wraps around belt closes two snaps
 The negative snaps close loop weak often come open
Other pluses: The case protects phone well, including face; earphone charger jacks accessible phone case; quick access phone
 

I pleased purchase
 I case avoid dropping cell phone shirt pockets delay reaching phone within coat pocket
 This works me
 

Snaps imperfect, overall pretty goodleather case
 I'd rather see clip back thandual snaps
 The front snap seems magnetic sofar anyway working fine
 Mostly I like thisis it's attractive horizontal
 

























I awful experience headset
 Nokia awful idea put nonstandard plug 8200 phones, make similar enough standard version make everyone think worked, causing immense confusion among manufacturers
 On top this, included headset piece never stays ear one hear on
 Body Glove made one (at time) went ear keep falling off
 The ear piece held tightly, causing speaker go away ear boom away mouth
 Thus I couldn't hear anyone couldn't hear me
 Plus, nonstandard plug lousy connections many times I lost
 The &quot;convenience&quot; hands-free headset became massive inconvenience using hands, one readjust earpiece another keep plug phone
 I way better without it
 I cheaper Samsonite Target (not available I bought it) works awesome
 Skip dud
 

I tried unit store, quality terrible
 The audio sounds like inside tin can, mic, I reviewed sending message voice mail, even worse
 I wish performed good looks, looks cool
 The Nokia earpiece mic combo, although unglamorous, head shoulders body glove
 I use every day business, clients don't even know I using headset
 

I bought one - looked like would comfortable (it is)
 But, looking cool wasn't goal - good performance was
The thing sounds like cheap, tinny kids radio
 It poorly outside wind noise
 It staticy interfernce (sounds like bad connections inside)
 Basically, thing junk
Used once
 Tossed it
 The Nokia supplied one way better - still looking one good ergonomics though
Bascially, don't waste money (


)
 

When I purchased item I impressed it's comfort aesthetics
 It also good clarity sound
 When first Body Glove fell apart within week, I figured I clumsily yanked it
 I purchased another defect occurred (the metal piece came holder)
 Enuf
 

I bought thinking great deal
 Its famous name brand it's [weak]
 It stopped working month, kept slipping ear tangles up
 Amazon
com great replacing it, quess what? The second one stopped working too
So favor go [a local store]
 I bought one half price worked 4 months
 

It looks cool, sound good it's always sliping ear
 I quit trying use it
 

Can't really comment user's experience, however, I thoroughly pleased product far (I 6 weeks now
)
 It fits comfortably sound quality good
 My phone carrier Voice Stream NY/NJ/CT tri-state area
 Voice Stream hand, stinks
 


The Jabra earpiece advantage cheaper Nokia replacement durable
 I found foam ear part Nokia particularly flimsy comfortable, Jabra's flexible, rubber earpieces various sizes considerably sturdy and, adapting day, found much pleasurable wear
 I miss hang-up button cord however
 Friends tell clarity improved Jabra
 Would definitely buy again
 

This product great
 I purchased one different model Nokia phone and, I bought new Nokia, immediately went searching another
 This earpiece much better one cellular retailers give free
 Theirs made uncomfortable, hard plastic circular
 The Jabra Eargels soft contoured shape ear
 I commute hour work wear Jabra entire commute problems
 Also, on/off switch model makes easier answer phone
 I love absence seperate microphone boom (which another thing I didn't like free headset)
 You don't worry positioning begin speaking
 



 

I've used different brands hands free kits, none performed well Jabra Earsets
 They sound crisp, people I call cell phone often comment good I sound these
 They also pick much ambient noise


I talk people cell phone without turning stereo car
 If you're looking good hands free solution cell phone, go Jabra
 You won't regret it
 

Although Jabra ear-gel much comfortable normal piece foam, unit didn't work well I expected to
 When I bought phone, I given Nokia hands-free kit free
 THe time I really used low-reception situations, since I wouldn't move phone whole lot
 WHen I bought Jabra Classic EarSet, I expecting work better Nokia's, picked lot background noise
 Upon receipt earpiece, I notice difference either two, color feel ear
 Over all, it's great product, I recommend Jabra product, it's dollars worth price
 
































































The Speaker nice loud, calls little noisy
It's good keeps phone charged feels well made
Overall I'm pleased it
 

Does job, great quality, cheap I'm complaining
 

I satisfied cell phone case
 There obstruction taking picture
 

I Nokia 2126i Tracfone later bought 6101 Tmobile-to-Go, compatible cable
 The cable comes driver CD
 The Nokia program downloadable
 As says instructions, install driver installing Nokia program
 Although driver instructions called attaching cable without phone, seems like Windows could recognize I also attached phone
Anyway, eventually I got working
 I found I could copy contacts Nokia 2126i computer folder
 However, adding entries phone, trying showed earlier entries Windows Explorer
 Nokia suggested rebooting phone computer, didn't help
 I eventually found making change changing back contacts entry Windows Explorer, telling save file would get update folder Windows
When I got 6101 I able paste contacts it
 The time saved made device worthwhile
 However, address entry one mobile phone number, one would make process
 The manually transcribed new phone
I've fun cable pasting MIDI files Gallery use ringtones
 Recordings made phone saved 
amr files
 These copied computer using cable, Nokia program plays them
Update above: Nokia updated software
 One noticeable change drivers bundled in, establishing plug'n'play compatibility much easier I first got product
The new software seems corrected problem failing update display Contacts files
The new software still seems see one mobile phone number contacts one mobile phone entered Phonebook phone memory
 

It worked exactly supposed to
 It connected Nokia phone computer via USB port I able download photos I taken phone computer
 It easy
 No complaints
 Period
 

I Nokia 2128i phone
 I also originally bought cheap version CA-42 advertised Nokia cable, wasen't
 I difficult time cheap version driver
 Sometimes worked, sometimes didn't
 Invariably driver reloaded time worked once, mess
 I finally gave up, ordered version, based three reviews
The true Nokia cable came quickly worked perfectly first time every time that
 

I want say thank carrying Nokia CA-42 Connectivity Adapter Cable Nokia phones
 I purchased different brand "cheaper" site thinking would work (it phone listed one adaptable)
 But guess what? It didn't work
 I tried everything I knew do; I tried help tips; I finally called
 They informed phone wasn't compatible even though list
I immediately turned around ordered Nokia cable site
 It delivered promptly, correct product, worked
I've used Amazon times always pleased service
 I continue use Amazon
com future
 

I Nokia 6102i got data cable I could easily move photos phone computer
 The software download free Nokia, minutes I using program without difficulty
 I thought cable worth price I take full advantage features phone has
 But I'll let secret - buy, check local cell phone store first
 This cable $29 Cingular store town
 

Buying cheap generic cable penny-wise, pound-foolish
 On hand, OEM product works without glitch whereas original purchase generic cable turned waste money
The Nokia PC Suite, including mobile modem fully compatible OEM Nokia CA-42
 I perfectly happy cable
 

I know lot people buy cable fix problems Seagate 7200
11 hard drives
 If are, careful
First authentic 5 wire cable, instead knock-off uses 3 wires shown demonstrations wire serial comms hard drive

This means spend time figuring wire what
Also, authentic cable, ends impossible peel back w/o destroying thing
 I made mistake cutting phone end prior plugging computer
 When I plugged USB connection wasn't even recognized computer (no sound effect notification USB device plugged-in thus $20 drain
 Since, I'd already chopped it, couldn't sent back
 So, moral story - check cable cut it, careful do
 

The item I received Nokia product advertised work phone
 It aftermarket china
 I finally ordered one Nokia worked
 Nokia cables made Thailand Nokia stamped plastic end
 

I bought cheap version eBay couldn't deal lack reliability, I purchased this
 I don't see difference, functionality totally on
 Haven't problems, wish I never wasted time knock-off version
 

This cable made Nokia would work phone
 I recommend anyone purchase cable
 

paid, tried nothing, waste money
 maybe better luck, product legit new, work me, phone recognize it, even though nokia website states compatible
 

I bought 2 brand cables first neither worked
 Very frustrated I finally bought expensive Nokia cable (horray
) worked
The reason I gave 4 instead 5 stars overpriced
 




there better way communicating one's Nokia cell phone this
 I believe Blue Tooth USB device computer would much better option, although I cannot vouch reliability Blue Tooth vs USB/Serial cable
A great product, opinion quite over-priced
 

Thank much, old phone pics wanted transfer pc
 This cable worked perfect windows 7
 Didn't problems
 Did said would do
 Was true nokia cable, knock-off
 Would recommend anyone
 

This cable Nokia cable sync Nokia 6103
 The cheap versions not
 While happy worked I returned since would stay tight phone
 They quickly refunded purchase price without complaint
 

The problem: phone numbers Nokia 6103 default storing phone, rather SIM card
 Of course, discover display phone cracked menu display stayed solid black (not good - need see menu almost everything, including recover saved phone numbers)
 So, thinking smart got replacement phone simply moved SIM card broken phone replacement phone
 Yes, new phone worked, The Horror
 All stored phone numbers lost
The solution: cable
We downloaded Nokia PC suite software Nokia's web site, plugged phone using cable PC, "voila"
 We could browse folders phone copy saved numbers PC, then, move new phone
The "trick" process discovering needed SIM card Nokia phone PC able see phone contents
 Once figured out, simply moved files onto PC broken phone, unplugged it, moved SIM card broken replacement phone, plugged in, transferred files onto new phone
This cable saved day
 

The Nokia CA -42 Connectivity Adapter cable Nokia Phones worked well phone
 I enjoying features Cable offers
 Delivery time excellent
 

Even Nokia support could help - painful experience
 



































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































I phone 2 months now
 It's good phone I listen music since mp3 broke
 It took time get used user interface
 There lots customization phone, wallpaper, screensaver, ringtone song media list
 camera's fantastic taking close images try zoom things gets blurry, working 1
5 megapixel camera though
 No games care thing sort putting review entire product
 The problems I said phone occasionally might lose call volume isn't high enough call even full volume
 The lost call thing might service error based location though I live near mountains
 The phone comes adapter use headphones, cheapo ones comes with
 

























































































This adapter NOT allow use 2
5mm headsets function properly directly connected E90 Communicator
 This adapter ONLY TTY devices - contrarty accessory recommendations listed Nokia's website
 


























































































































































































































It's wonderful phone



 I absolutely love it
 It 1 GB memory
 So much music
 :) I highly recommend it
 

This headset good microphone speaker
 It much better Body Glove EarGlove headset I used previously
 The microphone transmits voice clearly person speaking often cannot tell head set
 However, microphone adversely affected wind
 It come foam microphone help mitigate effect wind
 Other that, great headset
 

The soft ear clip easy put on/take - VERY convenient walking/going train/bus
 Good audio, great - I expected mono, NOT stereo
 































The charger doesn't contain connectors, contain first connector shown picture
 Therefore, I can't charge mobile, I need second connector charge mobile 

The charger works fine, it's type show photo interchange 2 different size connectors
 













Very easy connect Nokia E61i cellphone
 Also easy use high quality microphone speaker
 

It seemed perfect product since I would worry charging it
 But callers always complain cant hear clearly
 I think mic properly designed
 

Basically works
 The lights dim hard see day, OK night
 Took fiddling get unit engage cig lighter power source
 Get's good grade price simplicity operation
 

Last three months I went visit hometown, I bought Nokia bluetooth present father Tech Less, Amazon
 When I opened it, rubber plug broken it's usable
 For month later, started giving lots problems
 Sometimes connects sometimes not
 Now broken
 I really upset product don't believe Nokia makes poor product like all
 If don't want waste money car bluetooth trying buy brand name
 

The Nokia handsfree bluetooth device good one
It's ease use operation great
 The Quality incoming call volume okay
 going call functions device good incoming calls better sound quality
 The user friendly calling features ease operation good well
The incoming Call volume voice rather reception poor adjustment call volume improves quality incoming calls
 

This speakerphone easy set convenient use
 Because plugged cigarette lighter whenever ignition never worry charging it
 It located wherever lighter socket is, wouldn't work cars, works fine cars I tried on
 It easy hear, microphone little weak, course voice fades look left talking
 

This works well Nokia N75 speaker power weak I'm driving noisy Mustang GT
 It's little bit strange 12V battery able get 3-4W 8 Ohm speaker
 I'm going open case change speaker driver possible
I think Nokia design usually design manufacture accessories
 Usually Nokia specifies everything carefully OEM manufacturers I'm surprised see output power speaker low real application
UPDATE: HF-33W died two weeks warranty expired
 Great


 

After week researching bluetooth car kit options; I decided go simple approach
 The HF-33W small foot print, simple design yet functional(three buttons), complements car's interior nicely (07 MS3)
 After month use, I find noise suppression/echo canceling technology works great 2watt speakers sufficient max volume windows open radio on
 Also, complaints others calls
 So far paired automatically phone (LG vx9900 Moto V710) %100 time 2 seconds
 In addition works great turn turn voice navigation via phone GPS feature
 It automatically turns on/off/pairs cars ignition (depends car model)
 

I really, really wanted work somewhat 31 days, means I need send Nokia instead friends Amazon
 At first hassle
 It paired easily, connected within seconds
 A days ago started connect automatically I got truck used to, would still connect I requested manually phone menu
 Finally, two days ago would fail connect all, matter I do
 It pair, refuses connect
 (My phone connect Bluetooth devices
) Well, maybe I got dud unit, I review time worked intended
Pros:Convienent easy, annoying cordConnects automatically pairedMy truck shuts power adaptor running, worries draining batteryConnects lighter, worries charging unitI could hear party wellCons:Unit's ring tone distorted would cut (not sure defective unit)Need speak louder volume normal heard clearly, hey, speakerphone afterallLight indicating connection pretty tough see daylightFeels flimsyNeither there:Just FYI unit black, image page thinking front panel silver
 I didn't care, mentioning it
Overall:Would fit needs didn't stop connecting
 Now comes fun factory repairs, ugh
 

This Bluetooth car kit excellent value price
 It compact, hinge power plug allows fit confined space
 If car's power outlets always on, need remember unplug every time leave car, avoid running battery
 (I clipping unit car keys, I can't take car keys car without noticing Nokia needs unplugged
) The Nokia kit links iPhone reliably - however, note plug Nokia kit, briefly turn iPhone link; iPhone goes sleep, remains linked
 You linked see (faint) blue pilot light Nokia unit
 

I hoped would replace prior wired car kits
 The speaker inadequate
 You parked quiet area engine hear unit understand understood
 You may well park use handset
 Don't waste money
 

There better units there
 I returning this
 What headache
 The bluetooth connection Razr kept dropping, sound connected clear
 I'm trying BlueAnt
 

Reasonably priced, well built small size
 Audio - incoming outgoing OK, however, perhaps loudspeaker small, maximum volume attainable rather low
 

This unit easy use links quickly, mike pick voices well unless talking toward it
 The speaker controls clear easy use
 We use daily performs well
 

I used Motorola RAZR, phone crap--poor reception slow response keypresses
 While waiting 1st gen iPhone come out, I bought cheap Nokia hold over
 I amazed well Nokia worked, sold brand
I got Nokia HF33W wife's Highlander
 It's convenient Toyotas shut power lighter they're off, bluetooth kit car on
 Unfortunately, aren't many bluetooth kits designed plug cigarette lighter--at least reputable brand
After many months experience, I'm disappointed device
 First all, pretty much use loudest speaker volume setting hear people comfortable level road
 But that's least problems
 The bluetooth connection constantly drop
 This happened wife's old Blackberry new iPhone 3G
 Most times I call her, calls would get dropped within secs answering
 She'd call back handset, there'd problems that, it's reception problem
 The mic sensitivity far weak well
 On rare occassion I'm actually able conversation device, voice comes faint distant
Like previous reviewer, we're going replace BlueAnt
 It's bad don't model plugs directly cigarette lighter
 

Easy install works well enough
 Speaker sound quality great, loud understandable
 Mike pickup seems better expensive EGO Cup (also 12 volt system)
 Like 12 volt system, loud one must talk depends amount noise car
 Normal voice level car traffic light low speeds, talk loud freeway, even windows closed
 However, people receiving end say hear easy understand
Agree others unit feel substantial
 In addition, car, fit socket snug
 

I've bought Dad, brother & love it's simplicity
 One doesn't worry batteries actively turning on/off, it's based power cigarette lighter
 

Nice 3rd-party charger works great
 Good packaging shipment
 Excellent low price
 Inexpensive shipping
 I even bought charger another phone extra work

 SLIDERS ARE PRONE TO FLEX CABLE ISSUES
 Google 'flex cable'
 

My family actively used phone 6 years
 We brought Dubai high price thus found need use long
 It truly miracle time
 Not two cameras, one 3 megapixels
 It also flash internet capabilities
 Unlike many phones time clunky
 It almost like small brick
 It could thereby survive many high falls
 Soon plating covering front phone fell off
 It nothing thin plastic
 It gave phone cheaper appearance
 Also, graphics problems towards last year
 The screen became blurred "dead" spot right bottom corner
 Also, cameras began fog lose quality
 In addition, speakers useless video camera could properly pick sound
 It also became slow
Although phone many features, disappointed soon unusable
 We especially sad phone expensive (at time) great terms quality
Today, I would recommend previously stated reasons
 

Great Phone, also download lots lots useful software handheld/phone/game console/internet machine 

Had phone little year half, ok first it's flaws came through
 Being slide phone, it's never going last especially given fact slide spring assisted also extremely slow froze quite bit even firmware upgrades
 Finally display went I bought N82, infinitely better phone
 All features N80 plus none drawbacks
 If you're considering buying phone, favor check N82
 







I brought one parents
 They worked months stopped working
 Save money buy higher quality place
 

I received quickly works great
 I impressed great price
 





























































































































































This great item people deal mix phones (theirs family) use older large power connector newer (largely non US) smaller connector
 It means one (large) power supply adapter
 For instance daughter visiting New Zealand charger would fit wall outlets, chargers would fit phone
 Also I European GSM travel, I use US car charger
 

Was glad find item
 I got new cellphone takes different size charger
 I already several Nokia chargers also car charger like extras (keep one work always carry one car besides car charger)
 Ended buying 3 these
 

bought Freeplay solar/crank/flashlight AM/FM radio Australia last year eoulf also charge Nokia 5800 phone case emergency electricity disrupted
 The problem radio came larger Nokia plug
 This adapter allows charge phone power available
 

I ordered two They came predicted work What sayI'm happy Thank 

Works well, updates old charger new plug format, gives new life, without buying another charger, although price comes new charger cheap
 Since I keeping old Nokia phone well, makes charger duo-purpose
 I get new charger though, came Nokia Speaker phone kit, I equivalent two new automobile chargers N8 

This adapter allowed use Nokia 1100 AC charger Nokia E71 smartphone
The charge time using either older AC charger adapter, new AC adapter came E71
So, $5 shipped, I two AC chargers E71 - one use office, well one home
Have tried use adapter mobile Nokia chargers I already own, I imagine work fine
 

Works perfectly
 Saves money Don't need buy new charger
 Stay Nokia family 

I purchased Nokia adapter since I several old chargers I didn't want throw away
 The adapter works great, even third party charger I car
 No complaints here, satisfied
 

This right little adapter rescue old existing power supply use next generation Nokia phones designed charged light weight power supplies new tinier jack
 

This saved much money
 All old nokia chargers compatible new phone
 Great
 

The reason I giving product 4 old charger ends fit snuggly adapter causing fall glove compartment storing car charger
 Other products works perfectly
 























































































Love it
 It works well
 Use time phone needs charging
 Will order needed
 Thank You
 

I nervous buying phone charger cost penny I happily surprised came mail actually worked
 Sure flimsy ones would store job fine me

 And good price
 

Great product price
 Works great
 Cord little short overall would recommend anyone
 




























































































































































I'm pleased it

 This one swivels 180 degrees 3-9 o'clock positions
 Terrific value price

I've phone 2 weeks now
 I love speakerphone battery life
 However, I wish Nokia dedicated on/off speakerphone button I wouldn't activate speakerphone every call I make receive
 Don't get wrong here: quite simple activate speakerphone
 But less buttons I need press I'm driving better
 Moreover, clarity calls quite good phone NYC area suburbs
 This simple phone operate I appreciate fact I place home work address every person contact list, addition host phone numbers
 The voice tags work quite well phone simple activate
 Nokia good job phone regard voice dialing
I press lot buttons phone I call stock quotes course day
 Once button doesn't register I press I press harder work
 Furthermore, I already received 2 spam SMS Text messages
 Part reason I bought phone I longer interested Sprint Vision Service
With exception initial charge, sure charge phone overnight
 Nokia warns specifically manual says this, reduce phone's battery life
 So, I charge day hour
 Battery life real good
This phone want real good voice phone without multimedia web surfing services
 

A great candybar phone
 Everything pretty easy intuitive
I get great reception
 The small fairly cramped buttons take getting used to, actually work well
 My previous phone didn't quick on/off/options button top like one--a useful addition
 The speakerphone tinny works
 My favorite phone yet
 

I've mine little one year now
 It's held well abuse throwing around, etc
, it's showing seriously irritating signs use now
 Using keypad especially frustrating
 Many buttons register two presses every one time I press them
 I'm constantly backspacing
 I'm currently shopping around replacement
 

This simple phone w/clear reception, great features simple use
 It built speakerphone, headset enabled, rapidly charges/hold long charge, brighly lit colored screen, dropped callsSprint great network friendly customer service, perfect plans coverage
 By far best phone network I've experienced past 10yrs

 Shipping high
 

This great pouch great way carry phone
 Very sturdy convinient 




















love phone
 im nokia user discovered another brand
 enjoying using phone using it
 

reason got cellphone around 100 bucksand also features need
 really multifunctional, lacks mp3 player, video player, make product inferior, also advantage like longer battery life, important, least me, want style cellphone doesn't really care shiny features, get cellphone 

I phone several years now, works great take travel US India
 Get India swap sim out, good go
 The phone charges well either countries using charger, though charger needs different wall-adapter
Its simple use, intuitive
 The chocolate bar ID, perfect ID like
I highly recommend product
 














































































I've two these, three? The case fits 6682 fine (I didn't mind 6680 hole), found I dropped phone, case would pop off, phone fine
 This good price protection
The second case I ordered first starting splitting broke within couple weeks
 The company nice enough send replacement
 But case starting splitting I installed it
 Oh well
 Time new phone (I've 6682 since 2006)
I wish InCase iSkin made case Nokias like iPods
 

I sorry mine broke almost inmediately dropping phone able repair
 

So I purchased case 6682 arrived, discovered 6680 [extra hole front euro version's front camera]
 Not big deal
 The company felt necessary totally satisfied
 They offered partial refund
 They went way gf also case new N75 [also quality case]
 Thanks goods
PS: I hear ATT getting N95

The price great, shipping cheap quick
 The case fits cell really well
 I searched box stores even cell service provider stores
 I could saved bunch time I went Amazon first place
 

This case cool
Its really perfect 6682
U juss blindly go this
 










I've used product twice, satisfied it
It lasts long time (my experience ~10 days, would vary according speech time vs
 stand-by time)
In situations one needs product (e
g
 field trip, one cannot recharge battery), battery delivers worth price
The reason giving product five stars rechargeable batteries similar capacities,

 except calling someone you've recently called happen pressing green button clicking name
This phone, worst phone ever made
 I don't even recommend buying son daughter first phone
 It can't anything, embarrass them
 

EVERYONE selling phone category, must stupid


 The category says "Nokia 2610 (Unlocked)" implies phone unlocked used ANY network



However everyone category selling phone states phone locked "AT&T;" "T-Mobile" therefor implying it's unlocked phone


 don't buy phone category plan using another service provider
 

It won't work western USA
 Costs extra time find won't work send back end getting one phone company anyway
 Not good idea
I washed yet another phone got iphone best thing I ever did
 

This great, simple phone want phone making receiving calls text messages
 Reception quite good battery life great -- I go days days days recharges
 However, plastic cover display tinted mirrored virtually impossible see display outdoors daytime
 Most phones, especially basic ones like this, difficult see daylight conditions, one impossible
 It bad going getting new phone, even though I pay big bucks so
 This fourth (or fifth?) Nokia phone first one disappointed me
 

The 2610 promise great upgrade improved issues I GREAT 3120 3220 previous, almost perfectly enjoyable, Nokia phones
 But, alas blew couple stupid totally unnecessary killers
First GREAT things 2610
 They allow customize(assign)the navigation(arrow)keys functions YOUR choice
 theirs
 They added needed center button navigation keys
 They replaced infuriating proprietary NOKIA POP-PORT combination USB HEADPHONE access port separate STANDARD USB HEADPHONE jacks
 And expanded number length info added addr book contact
The killers me? The USB port PC Sync port
 It CANNOT used Nokia's PC Suite sync software, mfgs, back personal contact, etc info laboriously put phone
 Nokia, reading this, without IR Bluetooth wireless connection phone, one BACKUP data otherwise excellent phone put USB port on??? Second, heck would reduce readeability phone daylight removing ability remove wallpaper(increases contrast) behind contact lists, remove ability choose list place stupid miniuature unreadeable wallpapered icons Menus, add insult injury decreasing readeability daylight non-removeable shade display
FIX things PLEASE I come back otherwise excellent phone
 

Pros:- Simple Phone, lot bells whistles
- Good battery life
- Sound quality good, although, occasionally, hear echo faintly
- Comes speaker phone important feature me
- Customizable top two keys
 I've set alarm clock, useful feature right home screen
- Predictive text typing good
 Remembers non-dictionary words used past uses them, self-learning vocabulary
- Lightweight Slim, fits nicely pocket
- Displays day date along current time home screen (if configured)
 A useful feature
- Customizable Navigation Key assignments
 You assign whatever function like use press one navigation keys home screen
- Sending SMS text messages multiple recipients single message
Cons:- Impossible see display outdoors day
 (BIG flop)- 4-way navigation keys cumbersome
 Top okay going left right, keys buried keys hard press, almost resort using nail thumb press it
 Also center navigation key noisy makes cheap plastic clicking sound press it
 It frequently used key, settle noisy key operation
 (During meeting can't text friends tell bored are, noisy, example
)- Although phone feature Multimedia Messaging (MMS), buy unlocked, feature work AT&T; service
 Everything else works e
g
 SMS, Call Waiting, Call Conferencing, switching calls etc
- There mini USB port phone, charger headphone jacks, USB port maintenance personnel, cannot used sync data phone PC
 

I'd never recommend 2610 single issue display unusable daylight & barely marginal inside viewing
 It's shame sound good
 Maybe that's AT&T gives away free - hoping get rid them
 

I needed simple phone phone delivered
 everything perfectly go days without needing recharge
 also, withstand damage sense I accidentally dropped alot still works fine
 overall, phone perfect
 

This phone works great ways except daylight viewing display
 The display barely readable daylight, must shaded hand so
This phone gets close signal quality, great, last Nokia (6010)
 It great battery life talk standby
 I able use previous chargers phone too
This great basic phone want small phone bar-phone signal capabilities really good battery life
 

The Nokia 2610 great basic phone
 If need phone easy use one you
 Call quality reception great
 The phone straight forward user friendly
 

Doesn't matter free



this phone trash



it primarily designed get run cost meter internet


nothing more


 screen times seconds, hard read sunlight, contrary manual neither user friendly intuitive


I older black white screen Nokia "shorty" runs circles around phone
 Good luck
 

Nice phone design marred several faults can't overcome:1
 Who thought put tinted screen model? You barely see inside can't seen outside least bit light hits it
2
 Manual states volume easily adjusted pushing arrow keypad
 Guess what? I saw difference matter I pushed button
 The screen said volume going wasn't
3
 No vibrate mode
 Claims manual makes mention it
 Later discovered set vibrate -- making call
On plus side, good reception seems last 8 days standby, give take
 

This phone advertised specifically "unlocked"; therefore, nothing wrong read description
 It functional aren't interested messing extraneous applications
 
























This item good, information description failed mention type connecter modem itself
 The description say type connection modem x-jack one not
 There nothing tell information provided
 I would ordered knowing wrong connector
 





















































































































































I ordered earpiece directly Nokia 6800 $25, cat ate cord
 So I glad find set included earpiece much less -- two accessories besides
However, I disappointed
 The leather case useful never open phone use keyboard, even it's cheaply made
 The charger didn't much I already several those
The real disappointment earpiece
 It poor sound quality end
 People could hear fine, I couldn't understand -- covered phones pillows tried talk -- muffled quiet
 This case several phone calls several different people, wasn't person's phone connection
 Also, time, asking person repeat dozen times, I would give pull earpiece talk directly phone, sure enough -- without using cheap earpiece call clear
The last straw -- part prompted take time write review -- tiny piece earpiece plug broke got stuck phone
 It took while, tweezers all, get piece phone I plug earpiece there
 And guess what? I'll plugging $25 earpiece directly Nokia
 I guess it's worth price Nokia product all
 Certainly cheaply made, poorly performing "3-piece starter set" worth price
 




good product, well made
 protects phone without added weight
 cover stays place 












































I like appearance headset retracts well
 Initially, I pleased idea headset without spaghetti cord entangled previous phone headsets
 The device precisely picture indicates
But, work Nokia 6350
 This retractable headset supposed Nokia package price sticker 24
99
 So I assume retail outlet sell passed various hands sell online
 The package appeared opened previously curly part cord twisted though extended recurled properly
 I don't think I first person open pack
The packaging headset says "Connect headset headset jack phone
 When using headset, plug charger phone charging
 Please see User Guide specific installation instructions"User guide simply says 'Accessories', 'Setting', 'Headset'
 But, nothing it
 I purchased another model (not retractable) headset wife's Nokia 6350 worked instantly
 So, I sure problem headset installation phone
I don't know model particular cord device faulty
 





















































El producto es bueno, es elaborado con un material resistente y se ve de muy buena calidad
 Lo recomiendo, el articulo es como se describe en la p&aacute;gina, lleg&oacute; en el tiempo estimado
 

This case fits really good Lumia 800
 You get one without worries
 Go it
 

I replaced Nokia 3220 7360
 I excited get pretty phone
 I'm ringtones, videos, photos, etc, even though phone features many others, I use good ole' regular cell phone
This phone bigger I thought
 Definitely bigger 3220
One thing I trouble with, setting speed dial
 It would ask I want set up, I'd say yes, would ask enter phone # name I would
 Then would ask I want set speed dial (on digit), etc


 entering info again, would keep asking set speed dial


 kept going circle
 That extremely annoying
 20 minutes later I finally figured out, I don't know how, turning phone times, finally set speed dials
 It annoying brand new phone, shouldn't glitches
I also didn't like fact buttons hard (my 3220 soft rubber buttons)
 It also extremely difficult open back install sim card
The resolution camera definitely better 3220
 I hate handsfree earphones/microphone
 The microphone placed halfway chest way adjust higher
The speaker great
 Even crowd sound great
I received phone German Manual, English, European wall charger
 That's seller's fault, phone's
 It easy download English version manual internet easy purchase charger Ebay
 Make sure purchase phone comes correct manual charger
Even thought I didn't like model I huge fan Nokia phones keep buying them
 



First all, 8/24/01, Amazon wrong picture shown product
 You'll go somewhere else see actual pic product
 Good ear piece design
 Good fit good speaker
 The boom small works well
 People I talk driving pick-up truck able hear problem
 First design flaw: volume control
 There answer/disconnect button cord, volume control
 Too bad
 Second design flaw: cheap cord
 The cord stiff, light-weight grade
 This bad cord doesn't want lay flat body/chest
 It sticks out, defying gravity, according kinks developed packaging
 It would much better heavier, flexible cord, like used walkman headphones
 I could deal absence volume control, cord issue drops 4 stars (almost 3)
 Amazon's prices make great value, though
 I'm using company phone, I can't compare performance Nokia headset came -- never it
 

I 8260 since ATT started selling hated Nokia earbud ever since
 No one compatible headset I found Jabra EarBoom I happy camper
 It's comfortable, works (REALLY 
) reliable
 If I give ding anything would cable
 It's bit stiff - oh well - IT happens one perfect
 Bottom line - Nokia 82xx - get Jabra 

This far Jabra's bestm model clarity end person you're talking with
 Less wind background noise disturbance models, Jabra rivals Nokia's earpiece clarity
 One caveat, don't plan keeping little thing ear 20 minutes expect pain free
 Jabra could molded ear gels better wasn't sharp edge way around
 Of course, depends shape ear, I've heard others, it's something consider
 

Maybe I funky ears gelfoams come EarBoom worthless
 I Nokia 8260 love earbud came it
 However, I lost small foam piece (covering earbud) actually helps hold earbud place
 Since then, tough keep earbud ear without foam piece
I decided buy EarBoom replacement
 Bad mistake
 In addition staying ear, intonation tinny best
 The reason I gave product even 2 stars foam piece microphone portion EarBoom I placed Nokia earbud
 Small retribution worth couple stars
 

worth buy
 it's old item
 ear piece comfortable either
 

I recently purchased Jabra Earboom Nokia 8260 phone, Earboom excellent
 As many people noted reviews, image Amazon showing item incorrect, Earboom features small flexible microphone comes approx halfway face
 With 6 provided &quot;ear gels&quot;, I easily able find earpiece fit contour ear snugly, yet comfortably
 The sound quality listener quite good, people I've called told sound quality end also excellent
 With Nokia earbud came phone, I often found others couldn't hear well, dangling microphone would bump shirt collar get twisted around
 The on-off button also much-appreciated feature picking ending call driving
 

I tried 2 different Jabra Earbooms
 I sent first one back I thought deffective, make clickity clack snap crackle pop noises Motorola 720
 So, iffen phone, I can't recommend it
 

It good sound, actually I motorcycle I've using problem whatsoever
 People end hear well also
 

The ear attatchments great didn't plug phone well (Nokia) sound aweful looking part time use ear phone work
 I really liked way attatchments fit ear snuggly I didn't worry falling usually happens stock one Nokia sent me
 The clip little big bulky too
 




























This phone powerful clearly capable great things, implementation horrible
 The buttons don't feel right easily pressed accident, hinge feels weak breakable, software huge mess
 Even adding memory turning auto-data feature, battery life still disappointing phone often felt sluggish
 Tack nasty echo every third fourth call, enough return it
 I wouldn't order again
Make sure call AT&T; return phone amazon within 30 days
 You qualify 30 day satisfaction guarantee, able offer new free phone number
 

Too bad it's two year commitment
 I wish cheaper plan nokia n75 oriented providing easy way communicate/operate rather self-entertain
 I found phone functionality pretty dumb intuitive
 They call smart phone don't know that


 sometimes thinks long press button
 Reminds early era computer technology supposed slap monitor make work faster
 I'm happy though 3G phone connection quality remarkable
 This purchased phone for
 


Nice product
 Takes long time charge I guess problem car chargers 

I bought charger nokia 6120, listed compatible is, works supposed to
 It takes charge phone I guess "car chargers" disease
 Other say feels firm toy like chargers do
 Also say NOKIA branded, original part
 















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The photo shown item incorrect

The leather-type case clear plastic front shown photo another item

Although N-Gage uses Nokia BL-5C battery, I tried using model, brings better power supply original recommended Nokia
 If give hard use N-Gage opt battery
Best Regards
Gonzalo 

It took one two charging cycles hold charge extended time that, works like it's supposed to
 

Fast delivery excellent value
 Battery holds charges well days, I thought could lasted least 5 days
 

I ordered battery Monday received following Thursday, good
 Also battery exactly I needed I don't charge phone everyday now
 

Curiously, spite fact Nokia battery I followed registration setups instructions first use charge - particular battery seem hold charge long previous battery
 

This battery can't seem hold charge
 Dead within couple days device off
 You're paying get
 

It exact replacement battery Tracphone, still running original battery several years
The bad news: first battery shipped dead doornail
 I left phone plugged charge overnight got nothing
The good news: shipper included toll free number service, service people helpful
I go trouble shipping bad battery back them, quickly sent second one started charging immediately working fine
 

I previously purchased battery seller another cell phone I great (worked like should)
 This battery however "does not" hold charge longer one I replacing


 I blame seller I think better QC battery probably already couple years old shipped me
 The price, customer service shipping great
 

After reading reviews, even though negative, I still bought item thinking low price worth risk
 I completely satisfied product seller
 Bought Bluetooth previously i'm happy products
 

As I longterm user Nokia 3650 previously powered Nokia BL-5C, I say new battery I bought (BL-6C) really makes life easier keeping phone powered 5-6 days
 I would recommend product use Nokia 3650
 

With price low, I afraid going brand
 Was glad everything ad said arrived
 I felt made shipping much small battery weigh? Still, I would paid I would walked store, I get it
 The battery matter buy charged often
 Will consider I purchase new phone
 It probably use battery
 

Just like one came phone
 Works great
 




























Of three leather protective cases I used 5100 models Nokia cell phone, Technocel case best fitting much better clasp arrangement quick release
 The phone keys readily visible clear plastic front cover case
 I would recommend leather case
 















































































































































































































Before buying phone, doubts
 It's cool gadget like Sanyo Samsung phones are, hand, phones much expensive don't provide really 'must-have' features
After buying phone say great choice
 This Nokia phone easily beats Sanyo 8100 Samsung phone before, departments
 While 8100 looks like tech wonder, 3588 job cell phone do
 Clearer calls (even though, displayed signal looks weaker 8100
 weird), good sound quality, intuitive menu clean color display
In terms goodies, 3588 comes 3 games (only one really worth playing), polyphonic rings (some really good ones) couple wallpapers
Overall, need great cell phone, strongly recommend one
 It may hottest toy there, one best phones Sprint has
 

Due software issue Nokia Sprint phone's text messaging capabilities don't work Sprint's system won't software patch comes &quot;some time next months&quot;
 You spend least 1 hour Sprint's award winning customer service team find someone admit you
The problem Nokia designed phones incoming messages retrieved quickly viewed &quot;offline&quot; way providers work
 Sprint, however, likes people hook server first stay connected, burning minutes check inbox, compose reply wait Sprint server respond send out
Innovation money-making finest
 

I got phone January 12, 04
 I enjoyed ever since
 I replaced old Qualcom 2760 Nokia 3388i
Pros: Has bells &amp; whistlesGreat signal strength even basementBRIGHT display loud ringerEase use navigation menus3-way calling feature easy useVery clear earpiece(use standard earpiece)Voice dialing capabilityAn empty battery fully charged exactly 2hoursBattery talk time lasts 2
5 hours


many nifty toolsCons: Volume small without using earpiece attachment(best use earpiece)No CameraNo Speaker phoneLimited ring tones background images
The ring tones background images poor good
Can add additional ring tones background imagesOverall phone splendid functionally good price
 If want good phone particular ring tones background images I strongly recommend getting phone
 It light weight, good reception, clear sound, many additional features/tools
 

I bought phone year ago using ever since, Sprint PCS network, replace old TP2100
 The first time I bought it, phone defective, I get replaced days
 I liked phone okay first, I really wish I go back time buy better phone
Several issues:*mediocre reception
*rather bulky unattractive
*cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials
*screen easily visible bright sunlight
*battery life marginal
I go little detail things
 I get okay reception phone
 It NOT GOOD reception
 The phone work areas good signal, areas marginal signal, apartment, phone drop calls left right, fade 5 seconds every minute (this outside, interference building cause)
 In residence, I use husband's Sanyo, gets excellent signal, doesn't drop nearly many calls
 I Sprint check phone, say working correctly
 I assume poor quality phone blame
The phone quite big I would expect modern phone, camera
 In small purse, takes lot room
 What important phone cheaply made, cheap feel it
 It's made rather flimsy plastic
 I dropped phone onto concrete 3 feet up, antenna head got crack corner phone got serious scratches
 Also, screen difficult read bright sunlight, it's quite bright otherwise
As far battery life goes, it's great
 I've gone bed battery half full woken dead phone
 I believe poor reception immediate area blame, phone searches signal takes battery time
 Talk time decent
Pros:*LOUD ringer*lots features, I rarely use them
 

I've never owned Nokia phone before, first me
 I really like phone alot, reception great


even though signal strength show's low
 The quality phone great too, feels sturdy weighted
 I highly recommend phone
 

This phone great don't care vision capabilities
 I used samsung sch-3500 earlier, phone beats aspects
 I satisfied it's performance
 

1
) Slow - If want check missed calls list, phone feels compelled inform whether new calls list


it 20 seconds
 Of course, take half second read message


and probably don't care says
2
) Annoying - Ever anyone scream ear? That's sensation I get phone regular basis
 It nice ability attach voice tag phone number


a useful feature


when works
 About 80% time, recognizes number I ask for, 20% lets know doesn't understand


by screeching (next head)
 Want know feels like phone? Turn ringer highest setting, hold phone next ear, call phone
 Not pleasant
Add fact you're searching one numerous menus phone (menus least 5 items them), menu system uses whole screen display one line text
 It three lines available it


but uses one
 What's next? What pass? Go back look, can't find another way
3
) Fragile - My phone cracked
 Why ask? Because I took battery cover
 Why take battery cover ask? Because I wanted write review way find model number
4
) Heavy - Speaks itself


the phone weighs way much
5
) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks itself
My recommendation: buy better phone
 This one make cry night
 

I got phone Samsung A460 died (2nd A460 died year)
 This phone really cool
 I don't really care much Spring phones camera
 I've already bad experiences Samsung gonna stay away phones
Only good things say phone
 Never realized good signal place till got phone
 Even though shows half stregth voice quality great
 People phone hear really clear
Phone cool colorful, easy use menu
 All features ask cell phone
 Highly recommended 5 stars
 Too early say long gonna last got really good feeling one
 Hope Sprint keeps long time, unless come another Nokia
 

I wanted new phone, without camera, dependable easy use
 If ever owned Nokia able use right away
 The reception good, battery life fine, fairly light compact
It take month Sprint get text messaging setup me
 But I get unlimited text messages it's nice little feature
I 2 real issues
1) The vibrating alert strong
 If pocket may feel it
 But get call, lights also flash see dark theater, room
2) I getting dust inside screen
 I think might getting opening ear hole
 It's problem yet I plan going Sprint store look it
 

I love phone all, I really need one, I didn't expect price bill I received one
 Also, I've phone little two months still yet receive free accessories supposed come phone
 Every time I call company, keep telling wait couple weeks, I receiving shortly
Other that, I love phone I able it; I'm talking making phone calls
 :) 

This great, reliable phone
 I also purchased phone samsung A460 died
The menu easily comprehendable speed dialing available around 300 numbers
 Voice dialing also nice feature, takes longer speed dialing
The thing bothers games


Nokia seems taken snake (1 2) phones
 There skydiving game, bowling, tennis (like pong)
The ringers nice, feature available choose different ringer person calling
 However, ringtones available online download phone
 You're pretty much stuck have
 There vibrating ringtones regular (midi) polyphonic tones
All need covers reasonable price range


 

Bought phone months ago beloved Motorola Timeport died
 It decent phone Sprint offered (don't need photo, web, etc,)
 I've used phone daily areas continental U
S
, worked flawlessly
 I don't like way side panels phone light functions performed (namely, phone rings)
 That kid's feature, way disable panels lighting
 I knew I bought it, I thought &quot;so what?&quot; As such, I swapped Nokia daughter, LOVES Nokia, Sprint LG-LX5350
 It's flip phone (which I like), far, good
 The Nokia dad's phone
 (The rating courtesy daughter; I'd give &quot;4
&quot;) 

I got phone november 2003 I really excited upgrade 3390
 This phone great display wallpapers soonly enough I realized phones textmessaging work
 I got touch Sprint said launched January 18th whichhas passed still doesnt work
 Not mention coverage sux
 went 2 mall street house charged roaming charges
 So getting new cellphone I cant take sprints crap
 

I bought two phones use Sprint PCS
 My wife's phone locked (GPS failure) two months use
 After hour arguing store reluctantly replaced
 My phone failure six months use
 I'm switching another company's phone next week never use Nokia product again
 

Hello, I phone used I decided buy flip phone
 I NO problems battery new cases--it new fish case stays well original one
 I added ring tones, music good me--as matter fact I willing sell phone, home charger car charger great deal--email me--(


) 

Got (non-Amazon) Sprint store replace pre-historic Sony-Qualcomm CM-600 &quot;dogbone&quot; falling apart
 The Nokia bright screen easy-to-read large fonts -- unlike almost every phone available Sprint -- make usable older/visually impaired user
 The phone small light, features require number different button nav selections, it's worse most
 However, voice quality, per Consumer Reports eval, par
 I frequently use earpiece/headset combo understood
 

My Kyocera QCP-3035's battery died replaced Nokia week ago
 The phone web browser despite Sprint's product info description
 Neither enclosed hardcopy guide downloadable version made mention browser
 I called Sprint techs unable locate anything either
 The Rep said she'd reporting flaw supervisor perhaps might recall phone
 I would like see Sprint offer phone offer
 The bigger font color screen good I don't bells &amp; whistles I took granted &quot;old&quot; phone
 Locking phone manually prevent accidental calls well using voice command (when driving) pain
 I returning phone next week
 

I Samsung A600 awhile absolute doo doo
 You read review detect rage stupid thing
 It finally died I used Nokia phone I bought garage sale $1
 I wonder y sold cheap?


Bad: ===> I hate menu
 It takes forever get want scroll endlessly
 Usually phones numbered categories u simply press # get want go
===> It's pain put silent vibrate
 If you're class rings, turn immediately
 There's fast way silence damn thing
 Always remember put silent
 I learned hard way
===> It's true case
 It's mission get break ur nails process
 Also, you'll damage case time u try
 For reason phone started giving problems I succeed opening it
===> Buttons could bit bigger
 Vibration could stronger
Good: ===> Reception shabby
 I using elevator remarkable feat considering old phone would lose service simply putting pocket
===> Compared old Samsung, phone works quite well
 The ring tones loud enough hear phone actually charges quickly great battery life
 It doesn't heat like potatoe oven either long phone convos
===> Nice bright, large screen
===> Cute ways customize it
 Scroll bar set purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc
Overall: Okay phone
 It serves purpose definitely pales comparison new phones coming Sprint
 Why get get great? 

If want phone never gets reception, makes afraid entire thing fall apart, randomly lets know voicemail, constantly Sprint store battery failed yet again, phone you
Sprint ashamed selling thing
 Pure excrement
 I can't wait till contract up
 

The phone great every purpose offers, except day bought it-i couldnt get case off
 You take case put pictures jaket super cool, took back store-an employee said meant hard get off
 Well, could barely even get off- came close snapping casing half
 I never able get isnt THAT big deal, got dirty clear casing looks really dirty now
 MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF
 Oh charge ALL time
 

This phone junky, always falling apart
 Some features neat, phone terrible reception, compatibility more




 The battery charged many times dies rapidly
 Don't purchase phone
 

I've phone year I really like it
 Having never partial flip phones, I appreciate Nokia's features
 The color screen nice features easy use
 The keylock simple two-button sequence though I wish timer keylock like old phone
 It lot useful features, like calculator, organizer, stopwatch alarm, three games lame play
The customizable features nice, lacking variety
 This isn't ideal phone guy
 You're options pretty girly
 The ringtones also lack something desired, decent ones
The battery life pretty good, nothing special, definitely bad
 It gets average day without problems sometimes lasts several days
My parents, sisters, husband got fancy Samsung flip phones cameras toys, I must say mine works better
 The battery lasts MUCH longer recpetion MUCH better
The downside cute phone case
 It's made weak plastic cracked months
 Also, you're thinking getting different case it, DON'T
 Once take off, keep slipping off
 It never attaches firmly again, neither new case bought
 I've read reviews too
 Because this, last time I dropped back piece popped battery flew out
 Now phone issues
 Drat
Overall, it's great phone, you're content simpler things life
 Who really uses camera thier phone anyway? I reccommend buying protective case leaving don't drop delicate thing
 

This excellent choice Sprint use enrolling new customers service
 It free option new customers excellent year ownership
 I love lights someone calling helps really find phone quickly dark
 If phone purse really makes easy find due fact
 The Nokia phone seems tougher Samsung phones Sprint store also
 So issue phone fact since flip phone keypad must locked I drop phone pants pocket
 This annoying get used owning flip phone moving Nokia
 

The 3599i overall nice phone, except Nokia made universal headset jack incompatible 2
5mm universal headsets (even own)
 A phone call tech support required find need buy headset plugs Pop-port accessory connector bottom phone
 They ended suggesting HDB-5 headset
 

I want say everything cool it, I wanted able download new games ringtones possible phone? What website model download phone? But overall great reception colorful nice
 

I love phone
 I got days ago perfect
 It small gets service everywhere
 I pretty young don't need web-browsing capabilitys offered phone
 But I still love it
 

ok well im school need text messaging ive phone month text messaging supposed start working 2weeks ago
A conflict software type stuff btween nokia sprint
(Its 4 stars) And fact cant download ringtones
(3stars)Or games(2 stars)But cant beat nearfree free color phone(back 3 stars) soon gets text messaging b 4 stars
 

I got phone Christmas present
 It first phone I ever I absolutely love it
 It many different features really cool looking too
 I couldn't wait show friends
 

Cool
 Cheap
 Color: 3 words describe Nokia 3588 perfectly
I mean, DO want? This beauty's got classic, sleek looks jerks little Nokia 3310's looks
 The 3588 also amazing ringtones
 And I cellphone shop, I experience
 I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE
Do need prompting buy this, pal? Well, comes
:The Nokia 3599 includes alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator stopwatch 
And trust me, good value money you're tight budget
 And oh, you're thinking getting teenager, you've come right phone; they'll go crazy looks AND color LCD (which happens little oversize)
If phone's goin' adult, you've hit da soda pop again, lucky person
NOW ya convinced mobile's REAL
 (it is)
 

I got phone November 2003 I really excited upgrade color phone
I told friends told text well I tried message appeared screen saying service yet avalible I tried emailing sprint said would launched 18th January I eagerly waiting date date long passed sign text messaging
 This phone may free definetly worth stress causes
 If mainly get cellphone text people phone definetly right phone you
 I mean phone nice features three way calling whick friends nokia 3595 screen nice bright easy use
Another disappointment I found phone didnt downloadable ringtones wallpapers
 Another doubt towards phone I spent $40 cover phone found didn't fit right
 They wouldn't take back said couldn't take back wasn't fault I receipt everything
IF getting phone looks I recomend go verizon wirless het nokia 3589i looks exactley like 3588 silver 3589 navy blue
 They dont problems them
 













I ordered charger Amazon, Nokia 2610 cell phone
 My old car charger stopped working age phone, compatiable chargers usually available local stores
 This charger compatiable phone
 It charges fast strong
 














I purchased cable Nokia 6255i
 The cable came faster expected (I find Amazon fulfillment orders VERY slow)
 The cable came software driver (although I need it) worked great already installed Nokia Sync software
 Electro Island best price far service excellent
 I would definitely use again
 

I 6255i phone used cable connect windows XP home system
 The shippment came extremely quick
 Installation seemless drivers XP worked fine recognized cable immediately
 Downloaded Nokie suite software Nokia site work cable phone also worked fine
 Cellphone companies wanted 50 bucks cable
 Use one save money cable
 

I written cable faulty,and promised replace it,but


zero


where right cable nokia 6225 would recognisable computer?Send me,pleaseEli 


































































far I used three times ok
 It works fine
 

Item works great 6103 phone
 No errors phone plug fits like glove
 

I buying Blue Tooth headset I saw seller, CCMACCESSORIES 


for $4
00
 It came looked OEM packaging far works OK, excessive heat build extra charging time use


it works perfect
 The pin connector phone fits fine cigarette end fits good well



no forcing connections all, indicator knock-off product
 I bought Data cable folks well price, packaged works perfect (buy item, really great option simplify working cell phone 'Contacts' list instead pushing little buttons phone
) I don't know deal here, AT&T store items $30 - $35 online fraction cost
 

Been using product couple months problems
 It works great charges fast
 And great price too
 

product great works well would recommend family friends stylish I thinks would I phones

 

Aloha,The item came quickly, NOKIA product, work
 I haven't tried car yet
 Price best internet
Mahalo,Rudy 

This first car charger, disapoint, works great
 I highly recommend it
 

Just purchased 2 OEM Nokia car chargers (Nokia E71x) price, chargers shipping, super reasonable
 These original Nokia products, cheap aftermarket product
 And shipped fast order


highly recommend merchant
 

You always keep one car, nokia phone
 I one car truck
 nice design
 green light on
 

Great price
 And charges phone
 Not much else say it
 

This works fine
 It's Nokia product really shouldn't anything review
 

nice car charger, given original Nokia accessories, would assume, would say charger lives everyone's expectations looking car charger phone 

I tried saving $3 buying generic car charger fit Nokia 6133
 I reviewed piece junk
 It didn't work plugged cigarette lighter splitter end kept falling phone I picked phone dial
 I ended giving friend reports works decently Nokia (I think Nokia Music Express
 sure exact model number it's 6133 like I have)
 I ordered genuine Nokia charger I'm glad I did
 It works plugged splitter doesn't fall fall phone
 What world difference
 

Works flawlessly
 Item even arrived much earlier expected - time Christmas - despite Amazon estimated would arrive Christmas
 

Somehow I order properly
 The company accepted explanation I able exchange proper item
 

The product shipped quickly good price, one two chargers received works intermittently properly charge phone
 

Genuine Nokia Product
I Nokia 6133 found really good buy charger
 I seen charger sold 3 times I paid
 No problems far
If I *HAD* complain, car plug console I stik shift
 Since charger doesn't bend (some do), get way
But I light plug extension I use things low profile plug - resolves issue
 Since I didn't buy extension resolve issue, non problem people may go extra step find annoyance
 

I've using charger got tell helped lot nokia n80, battery runs fast use cell lot, charge whit little thing whithin one hour less got full charge, good look price
 

It took weeks track shipment
 Finally got re-shipped item doesn't work Nokia 6101
 Such waste
 

This OEM Nokia charger N80
 It works perfectly, made well, cheap too
 

Everything OK purchase
 The delivery time fine, product received good shape
 

This charger find cellular dealer, problems all
 

The charger works perfectly
 I really surprised fast got me
 Since I love going places, handy
 I planning install recepticle boat too
 

ok hour drive Iput charger still charged
 

This item OEM charger, cheap knock off
 It "control LED" comes bulk packaging
 The original DC-4 green LED light come zip lock bag
 A1 accessories: I supposed lick phone connector check power what? The cord short flimsy
 I several car chargers,(none OEM) one looks feels cheapest
 I gave star charges phone
 

I tried 4 different branded, car adapters phone (have tried 3 different phones well), yet one actually charges
 My extra dc adapter truck 15 amp circuit, works enough power
 I using DC AC adapter, regular wall charger
I don't know serious design flaw phone, charger


 For me, doesn't work, may well drive another brand phone next time 10 years loyal nokia customer, 3rd model phone them


 







































































The item didn't work
 I returned I'm waiting refund
 

I can't hear threw ear piece
 My recommendation buy product
 The ear piece doesn't sit well ear allow proper usage
 

Okay, Amazon items wrong
MX303-N1 Retractable Headset Nokia 6600, 6010, 3585ANDMX303-N3 Retractable Headset Nokia 3300, 6500, 8800 series 

Ok

 bought recently surprise compatible nokia 6600

thats phone
 So little research found product manual online ( submitted amazon

so appear sometime)
 I believe Plantronics people messed classified MX303-N3 one compatible 6600 MX303-N1
 Have look manual know
 

Was best work well 

































































































































































































































































I phone 2+ years (with T-Mobile) great
 One day son broke anthena I got newest version phone
 This phone soo much better new one
 The battery good, I loved everything phone
 

My wife loves phone
She phone years tell wore out
Then I got new one like old onefor ChristmasThanks Amazon
Yogi 

Since ATT GoPhone 'extras' contract phone ATT able use none-the-less
 Got AS PROMISED problems
 Will happy deal again
 























































The battery shows fully charged (4 bars) first day next day, drops 3 stars even without phone used
 So I'm sure new battery recycled one
 Also, product didn't come company pack I'm sure new recycled
 

I pleased NOKIA BMC-3 Extended 900 mAh NiMH Battery (chrome), I purchased January 2012
 I've problems I received less 1 week
 I strongly recommend buying anything seller
 

Easy use, easy apply, blurring lint issues application
 Recommended
 




































































































If buying connect Nokia phone beware
 It non-Nokia part easily interface Nokia software
 It uses different chipset Nokia data interface cable, prevents using standard Nokia drivers
 You may able get working, I spent four hours met success
 I installed drivers provided
 I installed Nokia's drivers
 I even installed PL-2303 serial driver, I could make work
Also note cable serial interface
 If converts USB connection computer serial port, likely happy data transfer speed
I would recommend purchase
 Spend extra money buy real thing
 You'll save head aches heart aches
God bless you
 

I assumed I would get DKU-5, supposed work according Nokia site
 However, I got DKU-2, indeed connect phone (6016i) recognized neither Win XP Linux
I'm bummed


 The part number properly displayed somewhere
 The packaging indicates fact Nokia part
 

The cord connect phone computer register phone
 This cord pure crap
 

I Bought one MyDealsNet It never arrived
 Be aware future buy seller
 

My equipment Nokia 6225, I 2 PC Windows 2000 Professional (SP4) Windows XP Pro don't works 
 They don't know device, PC Suite Nokia connected either
Who help ?Thanks
 
































































































































































































































































































































































Doesn't seem authentic nokia battery
 Made China instead Japan holds charge less day
 

I bought 3 tried 2 far
 The battery life 2-3x life battery replacing, best I remember phone new
 I couldn't happier
 I carry spare car, one office
 















I use Nokia 6010 primary phone
 I detest Smart phones want/need calling/texting capability
 This old phone served adequately 10 years rough handling extreme environments point crazy
 What phone could claim this?This fourth case phone, tell it's through
 The others ultimately ended non-salvageable condition
This particular case well made, better others I've used
 It leather, without stretchable fabric wears fastest
 In transparent plastic face round hole, I without, permit entrance dust, water foreign matter
 I may cover transparent packing tape
The stitching appears adequate leather, thin cheap looking, appears adequate
 None previous cases similar leather failure material
The longevity cases helped proper leather care, I regularly, especially exposure dust rain
If device want keep using I highly recommend using form case protect it
This case meet requirements
Note: I never use included attachment device
 I've two fail potential bad results
 I use razor remove attachment stud case back crazy glue cut/flap down
 This repair never failed
 With case protective sleeve I use exclusively belt pouches velcro flap
BTW, phone still operating without malfunctions although decent batteries becoming difficult find
 The ones I've found wear quickly
 My old battery lasted 7 years replacement
 The new ones I've found seem last 1-2 years best
 


























































This sturdy case holds Nokia E62 snug inside
 No shifting shaking inside case
 The keys easy get case opening keyboard
 The unfortunate thing case metal, also decreases signal strength phone
When making receiving phone calls, calls come through, within 1 minute conversation, call drop phone say network busy
 I tested out, making phone calls case without case discovered signal strength goes phone case
 So, live area coverage spotty, case diminish signal strength significantly
I tests home also work
 Out case, I'll see full six bars signal
 When I put Nokia case, front cover open, I see 3 bars disappear 3 bars remaining
 When I close front case, remaining 3 bars disappear nothing
 I test located inside building, ground floor, near window
 Without case, I get excellent reception drop calls, case locked, reception
 I make outgoing calls, call quality poor case on
So, want great shielding Nokia, literally armor PDA phone
 Unforetunately, also shields cellular signals well
I initially gave phone 3 stars sturdy really protect phone, I'd downgrade ONE STAR renders phone unusable
 
































































































































































I picked couple generic ear buds never worked phone, great selection works fine
 







































































After six months use, I've quite satisfied Nokia 3390 T-Mobile service East Coast
 While hardly-cutting edge terms technology, phone covers basics communicating pretty well
 The reception, even moderate weak signal, crisp clear
 The ringer tone doesn't sing polyphonic songs, loud enough carry book bag heavy jacket
 The buttons well-placed
 The menus pretty easy use
 The backlight display panel won't light room like newer Nokia models, gets job done night-time dialing
The batteries last two three days, could longer
 Don't expect lot features
 The calculator pretty hard use
 One complaint clock, shuts time phone turned off
 In areas, regional signal sets time phone turned on, places
 Not accurate time phone hassel trying figure missed calls received
It's plain, simple phone, nothing more
 

I used switch cel phones order keep technology
 Crazy screens crazy features
 I always made fun (then) fiancee nokia
 Also, I hated nokia ring
 You know one I'm talking about
 Because I hated nokia phones
 Then got married


To save money, I needed plan offered shared minutes job, I needed something flex contract (I wasn't going sign anything TWO years
)
 I comparison shopped everywhere brands
 It pretty easy choice came it
 But
 The phone required following me:-Text Messaging-Stupid Addicting Games-Ability personalize rings-Ability personalize display screen-Hands-Free hook-up-One number dialI got Nokia 3390
 Plus I found surrounded numerous faceplates, keypads lights choose from
I weary design
 I always flip-phones before
 They always protected embarassing accidental calls put phone pocket
 Nokia easy way get key lock: menu + &quot;*&quot;
The predictable text text messaging part amazing
 Leaps PT I used past
Battery lasts days charging
But best all: When I break it, parts VERY easy get
 My wife smashed display
 I immediately new screen
 The aftermarket parts plenty, careful


I remember reading woman's hair caught fire dropped phone aftermarket battery
 

Although phone lacks modern technology stuff, great durable, user-friendly phone
 It easy use cost efficient
 I actually done everything phone dropping hard floors water still operatable
 I phone almost 2 yrs I upgrade I still keep back-up
 Has color camera still download ring tones, instant message, send text messages, play games
 I recommend phone people want make receive calls afraid hi-tech phones

 

I recently traded 3390 Samsung x105
 I got rid battery dying I wanted try new technology
 My Nokia, though 3 years older, compares quite favorably new one
 I rarely missed phone call due non-polyphonic ring tones
 The sound normally stuck I could often hear upstairs blaring radio
 The vibration feature powerful I always felt it
 Overall, simple use practical
 Newer phones often many useless features, actually takes away phone
 I miss phone
 Aside dying battery, I major complaints 3390
I'm definitely looking buy another Nokia future
 Hopefully live standard
 

I phone year now
 I think durable phone nusance
 I dropped many times, even water
 It broken works well
 I like lot features- basic
 It works well me, simple phone
 

Well NO matter someone says it's one best phone Nokia
 I agree basic 

 fancy stuff like camara GPRS WAP got AOL messenger
I phone 2 years works great 


 battery time still good
 perfact voice quality 

 good network coverage 


 else need 


 basic phone
 

As simplific longest lasting cell phone EVER
 Bravo Nokia
 It fell concrete pavement many times
 - falls apart - doesn't even disconnect call
 So, finish talking put back together voila
 

I've phone 2
5 years now, it's great
 Always reliable basic comes features (except AOL IM)
 The bad thing faceplates hard remove
 Other that, it's good basic reliable phone people want something simple
 

cell phone year could anything it
 get one try self
 

A little bulky missing modern features, looking cheap, well build phone talk long battery run - item buy
 

This great basic phone
 There bells whistles
 I got phone reasonable size basic phone
 I like cell phones simple
 If don't, might phone you
 

I remember phne first came VoiceStream Wireless
 Jamie Lee Curtis, family plans, girl party wth phone hip dad constantly watching thru mobile-to-mobile calling
 Everyone I knew phone
 With AOL IM
 I also 3360 AT&T


 both, since similar are, opinion, best phones EVER
 Despite absence color, cameras, etc


 They excellent talk quality, excellent battery life, could kicked around beat up, still work


 My 3390 3360 standby time 5-7 days, I dropped 3360 several times, left rain, 3390, I left pants pocket washer still worked 100%
 I liked 3595 T-mobile b/c kind like update 3360/3390, I didn't like t-mobiles service
 In opinion, If I could, I'd definitely go back use phone
 And sometimes, I stilll do
 I motorola RAZR V3, I 3390 unlocked I could use cingular



 

The phone certainly going overwhelm features
 While battery life good
 The phonebook barely passable requires entry every phone number want store single person
 But annoying thing long takes turn phone actually use it
 I upgrade different phone I managed throw one ground last time irritation
 

Within past 6 months, got 3 different phones, best
 Battery last 10 days works great
 My wife wants keep forever
 

Iv'e phone little year recently iv'e getting problems it
 The problems call phone hang sudden get bad echo gets irritating
 I probably cause problems though countless droppings, getting stepped much more
 The phone works great games plays them, IM want text somebody
 So yea little essentials phone
 You customize changing faceplates even downloading tone two
 So yea I recomend want phone dont want worry bout getting hit two like new color screen phones
 I really dont know want phone half stuff fragile I already know three people broke screen phones opinion trouble worth
 STAY WITH THE BASICS YOU'LL LIKE THIS PHONE


 

Its really master peice everyone own
 Its peice wherein u receive calls handy one sms
 I think u enjoy pleasure owning peice
 Its master peice me,u n everyone
 

This si reliable phone never failed me
 The ony problem bit old date
 The problem realize buttons bit small, may big fingers
 

cellphone year got rid anything wrong wasnt color really wanted try out
 biggest mistake ever tmobile one best services stuck sprint one get absolutly sucks 

This best phone I ever used
Even though many new phones market
This phone still compete them
A cell phone shold work like phone camera anything
If looking best performance phone go it
 















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































This phone compact, attractive, powerful
 It's hard believe Nokia packed much phone did
 One best features ability make "Internet calls" wi-fi connection
 I use Vonage home phone service, I add "softphone" service plan, enter connection setings E65, join available wi-fi network anywhere world, I instantly able place receive calls without using wireless service provider all
 Now I Hong Kong business I sit hotel room call home FOR FREE
 Likewise, husband call using local number reach wherever I may world (as long I connected wi-fi network)
 I also check email browse web new phone, watch Slingbox using mobile player, listen audiobooks, use built-in calendar keep organized, sync address book Mac using iSync, list goes on


 True camera greatest world, phone all
 When I want take memorable photos I'll use real camera
 It's fine sending quick picture message somebody though
 I feel little gadget well worth I payed it


 kind cool carry around RAZR clone everybody else
 My one gripe lack stereo bluetooth


 I'd like able use pair bluetooth headphones (real headphones, little one earpiece thing) compatible
 Oh yeah, I use T-mobile USA absolutely problem getting phone work
 I access voicemail, T-zones, etc T-mobile branded phone
 

This phone lot great features it's really nice, takes time get used menu


 main problem found kind leathery paint peels carry pocket, don't recommend carrying jeans pocket days off


 looks really bad


 

My typical usage comprises text messaging, handful calls browsing web
 This first smartphone capability open business documents, built-in html/xhtml browser, wi-fi gps* considerable upgrades previous phone
 The Nokia E65 replace video digital camera, ipod, radio gaming console
 I fine since I choose add-on capabilities mind
 Its weight thickness liking
 It may razor thin still remains unobtrusive tuckered jeans front pocket
 Here rest review:- The phone, bought Amazon two months ago, extra [Chinese?] characters keys 1-5 # along Roman alphabet
 Yes, I bit disappointed first getting keypad version likely
 It mentioned Amazon's site seller websites cell phone mostly sourced internationally
- MY startup times** 43 seconds memory card, i
e
 seven seconds time button pushed white screen 'NOKIA' logo
 Another 36 seconds menu
 37 seconds without memory card, i
e
 seven seconds first splash screen appears 30 seconds menu
- I wanted slider design choice SE W580i
 I found keypad cramped
- I like phonebook search works matching character order typed
 On old phone, first character contact name searchable I scroll list
- Wizard setting internet access point detected AT&T; Medianet T-Mobile T-zones
 Although I modify one setting T-zones make work
- Humming buzzing sound emanates unit is, apparently, normal (from noted Nokia forum)
 It audible really quiet environment
 The sound stops backlight timeout kicks in
- There one alarm setting needs reset daily
- The case creaks typing message
 My solution place small folded rectangular paper padding sim card area latch
- The plating navigation buttons prone smudges since one would typically push slide up
 I covered area screen protector remedy
- A charge lasts three four days based usage bluetooth wi-fi scanning disabled
 One week standby
* Only I crazy enough shell dollars addition regular cell phone service
** Counted seconds tick watch
 

This telephone great
 It works like charm
 If windows base, imagine never reset phone
 

really nice phone, visually
 it's thin, elegant, beautifully designed, thou lil masculine side
casing / back doesn't feel metallic, leathery feel really neat - hopefully hard(er) drop floor
issue N80 (the fact slides open easy) fixed - one opening handbag calling people like N80 used to
menu similar Nokias, thou never make exactly - getting-used-to-time required
the beef phone camera
 compared 3 megapixel N80 Sony ericsson 3
2 megapixel autofocus camera, E65s 2 megapixel flash nothing camera real step back
its e functions justify reverse evolution camera dept
thus title 4 stars
 

It's nice, lot features still, camera 2 mg
 

















































































































The quality manufacture generally excellent
 It reasonably well finished
 The belt hook completely inadequate, primary (and secondary) reason selecting product
 It starts weak hold gets progressively weaker
 




























The batteries good life work well
 No problems price great
 

Great battery; I lasts long never problem it
 

I'm happy quality product I short time I recived product 

saudi battry ( made china ) verey verey adynamic butt battry made japan verey Excellentmr
mazzen 

I worried might fake, looks like genuine Nokia battery presence holograms
 However, new batteries
 They dents scratches, general grime show used removed another cell phone sold Amazon "new
" The battery doesn't hold charge 2 days
 False advertising
 Since cost $10, trouble worth file claim, dispute charge, etc
 etc
 

HiI bought item couple weeks back, worked 2 days thatit stopped working, I sure could reason, I replaced another battery mobile worked
I extremely unhappy product
ThanksSuresh 

Battery DOA
 Fully juiced, manages hold charge mere 12 hours IF don't make calls
 Batteries shelf life, obviously past theirs
 And, make things even better, cost nearly much ship back replacement cost purchase 1st place, thus nearly doubling original price (seller doesn't cover shipping)
 AND I would run risk getting another dud (seller 5 stock)
 Easy way flush $$ tube
Do favor buy new phone, stop trying breathe life dinosaur (like I was)
 

The replacement battery work
 Not sure why
 Since relatively inexpensive, I return it
 I still getting old battery
 

The battery looked like mine previous genuine Nokia, definitely heavier
 One I ordered work all: took charge three-four hours even without speaking
 I asked received refund
 

I nervous first purchase current mobile phone provider
 What fit, work, I cannot return it? All questions answered satisfaction purchase battery
 The seller responded requests prompty
 I received battery record time battery worked great
 It came without charge, again, I thought,"Oh,No
" However, charged, battery life usually atleast 3 days works perfect Nokia cell phone
 

I bought reserve battery N80
 The n80's use electricity drains power fast rate
 It great backup I get gaught dead phone
 

It lasting long problems
 Plus, great price
 I trust anything Nokia OEM battery
 

I really glad find battery every store I looked one size
 Actually one store price 3x cost
The issue I might battery life bit shorter original one
 

Great place batteries
 This second purchase here
 It goes show much cell phone companies mark accessories
 











































































It fits perfectly
 Only thing back cover camera keeps poping out
 Pretty good case
 

This case great way protect phone scratches dirt
 It's glove-like fit looks great, it's open compartment sections align well phone
 I definitel;y recommend case anyone Nokia N72 (or N70)
 


















































































This works fine, nice better original, little led reminding it's plugged (thus reminds unplug use)
 






































































































































































The case perfomed excellently, protected phone, popped belt clip, fits phone well
 It lost star, however, silver decorative markings began rub off
 In opinion, case would attractive without flawed meaningless decoration
 That said, since best case available particular phone, I would buy despite minor fault
 

This great case
 My phone fits well
 The clip little fatter I wanted great buy
 The swivel nice I work school kids hit phone hip moves them
 Thanks 

































































































































































I bought case I would protection everyday scratches shock-- however seems much ask
 I dropped phone ground (as I sitting chair) recently case snapped two places
 This shows poorly made case is-- I would advise anyone may drop phone 2 feet high consider buying better quality case
 I went ahead bought another case different company-- I probably say worst $12 I spent long time
 

The case sturdy



the edges broke within week

i dropped phone mishandled it
 It either sitting pocket desk
 

Thankfully, I spent $
80 I bought like first reviewer, I found provide NO protection all
 Cute, yes
 Effective, no
 FYI, I logged buy another 8-10 $
80 price point, I figured might last 4-5 months, $4
95, way
 $19
99? That person's smokin' crack
 

The case wouldn't even snap together inexpensive really wasn't worth effort anything it
 I purchase anything like again
 






















































































































































































































































































































































































































































The price good
 Apparently microphone works fine, end sounds like i'm listening muffled tin-can
 It's also quite uncomfortable
 Fortunately, it's cheap enough throw find one better sound variable sized earpieces
 

Whoever came pop-port idea aware faulty design
 This ear piece lasted 1 week


i'm 10th ear piece horrible design allow easy insert removal ear piece


the pop port connector stinks
 Is buy 10 get one free deal there? 







































































This antenna sub-standard even dipole elements like original 6185
 It works good original antenna elements broken
 Waste money
 Find Nokia genuine replacement
 









The low price battery made skeptical
 I'm glad I ordered anyway
 So far, it's performance equal battery came Nokia phone
 It holds charge well original battery, provides excellent connections
 Before ordering, I priced comparable replacement batteries Radio Shack
 Their price appears thing $49
 

This battery work properly
 It accept full charge
 Sometimes says fully charged, run charge go dead soon make first call
 It seems charge properly AC adapter, car DC adapter
 

For year, I've trying find replacement battery 5165 Nokia cellphone, since I desire "migrate" ATT Wireless network much abbreviated Cingular prepaid network
 Nokia supported product since I first started looking
This after-market part works better original battery ever did, fits perfectly, hasn't given one second's trouble, caused problems
The best part that, outlay $20, I still full use one best, AMERICAN-made, cellphones Nokia ever built, and, unless Cingular offers moon, stars, brand-new Corvette migrate Cingular's network, I another 4-5 years superior service superior network
Thank Technocel - keep good work
 

The battery I received doesn't seem hold charge nearly long original
 Bit disappointment
 


























































































Quality product fit phone perfectly
 It replacement one I years worn out
 




















































































































































































































































































































































































































































Even though I'm able hear whoever phone fine, person I'm calling can't hear word I'm saying microphone isn't close mouth AT ALL
 But again, it's always safer accessory driving hand-held phone
 

This works, earpiece big falls ear
 The earpiece (speaker) cover fell missing
 The part connects phone doesn't stay connected
 One side falls I hear person end, can't hear me
 Sometimes, I get high-pitched squeal I headset plugged in
 When I remove it, squeal goes away
 I high hopes I use phone lot serious concerns radiation exposure, item left disappointed
 

This example pay for, get
In less month thing fell apart longer worked
 I somewhat impressed I got it, job flawlessly
 I suggest going headset though something wont slide ear
 

When I received gift, I thought would really boon since I spend great deal time discussing business clients need able use keyboard time
 Due static, connection problems(to phone itself) uncomfortableness, within 30 days thing become useless
 

Although good headset, I found mine tearing bottom plug



several wires stripped bare copper
 I splice wires myself
 Besides less comfortable (ear piece) awkward phone belt
 

This ear piece Nokia awful product, lowquilty
 The speaker piece way near ear piece, two one
 I recommend [higher end products] one, I'm willing pay them


 



























































































































































































































I settled headset hesitation lot research
 However, I extremely satisfied earpiece
The best feature definitely way clips ear
 It looks kind funky initially putting intuitive
 However, on, going nowhere
 I friends different brands earpieces fell ears
 However, I went amusement park rode roller coasters rides day long
 Nothing could budge earpiece year
 On one ride, sunglasses almost flew one move
The second good part sound clarity, part due design clipping mechanism
 If used ipod style ear bud headphones handsfree devices, realise without sort pressure earpiece, sound quality really best
 You need press finger get right loud sound
 However, earpiece like cell phone instrument ear
 THe clipping mechanism creates sufficient pressure result reasonably loud crytal clear sound earpiece
 It actually better phone (NGage QD)
Battery life also good, along features like voice dialling, mute etc (which reviewers covered below)
Due strong clipping mechanism, may initially feel uncomfortable even hurt ear hours
 However, subsides within days start feeling wierd ear :)The microphone good person end always able hear clearly
 I also left voice messages check clarity perfect
 One caveat, though applicable wireless headsets, due distance microphone mouth, suitable discreet conversations especially disturbance
 This earpiece better others respect though
There features I wish Nokia included make headset uber-headset
 I wish indication battery level
 Though I run trouble, nice know stand
A vibrator option would also nice
 Though I know would end adding considerable bulk earpiece, seems like nice thing have
Overall, I really like headset would definitely recommend anyone
 My friends headset like Jabra etc used one really impressed
 I tested Motorola Sony phones works perfect too
 

This first bluetooth headset I must say I really impressed
 It's unique design fits ear perfectly voice clarity excellent
Becasue I also Nokia cellphone (6230), I able utilize phone's features bluetooth headset (HS-11W)
 You can:1) Perform voice-dialing (press hold send/call button)2) Mute/Unmute conversation (press power button air)3) Auto-redial (press send/call press hold)4) Lastly, favorite feature


you listen phone's MP3 music (too bad can't listen radio--you still need connet enhancement headset)Overall, I impressed product
 I highly recommend it
 

This item works quite well
 Especially connected original i
e
 Nokia phone(6310i), I also connected Siemens S-55 good results
 No problems far, nice clear sound
 And remember excellent battery life time;-)As pepople mentioned; I understand doesn't fit ear, worth trying it
 It took time figure fit ear



- I never imagined could difficult getting dressed;-)Final benefit: It came nice battery charger also fits phone
 GOOD
 

A co-woker headset
 I got use Nokia phone today
 It looks like something star trek it's ear don't even notice there
 It's super-lightweight sturdy
 We looked funny shaking heads trying make fall thing stays put
 Very good voice quality nice solid design
 5 stars Nokia making unique, well built headset
 

I several different wireless Bluetooth headsets now
 I want share criteria I believe need apply buying next Bluetooth headset
 The Nokia HS-11W unfortunately fails several criteria, almost every headset market right now
An excellent Bluetooth headset following characteristics:1
 Comfortable fit - need headset comfortable least hour time, entire day
 (The Nokia fails miserably; tines dug ear top bottom, impossible correct it
)2
 Secure fit - nod shake head, don't want feel headset wiggling around shifting position
 If does, constantly reaching check adjust it
 (The Nokia fairly well this, two tines hold ear may creep time ears, needing occasional help right hand stay place
)3
 Excellent incoming sound quality - anything less thrilled
 Nearly every headset market today fails criteria
 (The Nokia middle pack this; times fairly good, sometimes wretched, certainly never excellent
)4
 Excellent outgoing sound quality - surprisingly, absolutely relationship incoming outgoing sound quality
 I tested wide number headsets nearly every one fails either number 3 number 4
 You don't want callers ask calling wind tunnel, don't want echo either end
 Echo major factor headsets
 (Although I never heard myself, callers sometimes experienced echo; overall sound quality mediocre besides that
)5
 Noise cancelling - headset form noise cancelling technology others hear speak noisy environment
 The best Bluetooth headsets available offer DSP (digital signal processing) filters noise, implementation technology inconsistent, DSP necessarily mean happy performance noisy conditions
 (The Nokia cancellation circuitry, became obvious trying use bars even outside mildly windy conditions
 I recommended loud environments all
)6
 Sound isolation design - The noise cancellation helpful outgoing sound quality, incoming sound, I believe earpiece fit INTO ear canal, completely blocking outside noises YOU hear CALLER clearly
 I tested many variety, disappointed maximum volume low, also fact others could sometimes hear caller saying standing close I use it
 I pair Shure E5C earphones I use iPod
 These inserted ear canal, I assure personal experience effective means solving incoming sound problem
 An in-ear design completely isolates incoming sound, meaning I don't turn volume high hear even noisy environment
 It also helps secure fit issue above
 (Like today's headsets, Nokia speaker rests ear, fails criteria anyhow, I also found volume low even quiet conditions
 It impossible understand callers noisy environment
 Impossible
)7
 Fast connection speed solid connection - phone rings, need headset react quickly
 Many headsets not, sometimes miss calls headset's slow reaction speed
 This often fault phone's Bluetooth implementation, headset
 Also, want connection phone stable
 Many headsets drop frequently must reestablish connection even re-mated phone
 Again, sometimes fault phone, always
 (The Nokia well category, it's one criteria I could score highly in
)8
 Excellent battery life - want headset need charging infrequently phone itself
 In words, want last least day, need remember charge charge phone
 (I happy battery life; Nokia middle pack
 It also hard turn off, power button difficult depress, especially unit still ear, sometimes even think it's it's still drawing power
 The battery life long enough that, like phone, never turn don't care to
)9
 Low battery indicator - want know headset getting close juice
 (The Nokia beeps low batteries, give warning far enough advance
 I would like see headset start warning least half hour it's going die
 Better yet, actual battery indicator like cellphones?)10
 Features - want able initiate calls headset, want support voice recognition phone offers that, literally dial end calls without ever touching phone
 (I test Nokia features I already disgusted bother)I found ultimate Bluetooth wireless headset
 I currently testing Gennum nxZen Plus 5500 Cardo Systems Scala-500
 If don't cut mustard, next another promising entry, Plantronics 645, yet released due day
 Also interest Jabra JX-10, I hands yet
It become clear headsets better certain phones worse others
 My tests done one phone, new BlackBerry 8700c
 However, product enough flaws design make unacceptable phone
Bottom line Nokia HS-11W: keep looking
 

This headset great battery life, dedicated volume power buttons another button answers hangs calls activates voice dial
 It great sound quality microphone clear
 Also, looks cool
 It doesn't nerdy, annoying flashing lights
 It's slick
 Judged features, deserves 5 stars
 I give 3 I barely wear hour
 I wear earpiece headset work, sometimes day long, without problem
 This one squeezes hard actually gets painful
 I thought I would get used it, I've 3 months luck
 I wear hanging halfway ear can't clamp hard
 I applaud Nokia trying something different, it's good
 

I purchased headset local retail store
 I impressed clarity, comfort, ease use


Then went completely dead 32 days, time overlap 30 day return policy store
 I mailed Nokia repair
 Everytime I call, say cannot find records put hold 30 minutes finding it
 It 8 months Nokia given run around last stating would send check amount discontinued bluetooth headset
 Let's say, I still waiting
 In conclusion, Nokia really bad customer support
 Out principle, I never buy Nokia product again
 

Interesting design, get right great fit
Sound quality excellent
Downside battery life substandard
 

After week reading forum forum different available bt headsets, I decided give one shot
 Overall, keeper
 The earclip different, definately secure "forget there" comfortable (I find secure horizontal position)
 The first call I made noisy steak house, problem either end conversation
 It instantly effortlessly paired V3 Razr, takes 3 seconds connect powered on
 The change I could see would perhaps optional eargels, although thing PLENTY loud clear volume high
 No adjustments necessary (or possible btw) change ears it
 The range seems real-world impressive too, distortion/static whatsoever Razr within 15-20 feet
 Ive actually people know I even cell phone, muchless wearing bt headset



 even rural cellular void
 Works great put phone near window, pull good cell talk away Nokia HS-11w
 No fumbling controls uses either, seperate volume, call answer/end/voice dial/last redial, power/mute buttons breeze manipulate
Slick, secure, actually *works*
 What could anyone ask



 midrange priced bt headset, I recommend anything Jabra Moto offer
 Do homework hopefully you'll buyer's remorse



Btw, doesnt fit ears, might want check family tree stumps ;-) 

I everything good say using bluetooth headset
 It pairs easy, long standby long talk time
 Conversations clear, full fedelity available telephone
 It small enough fit shirt pocket, take good care lose it
 For talk quality, pleased
What need know headset many others batteries cannot replaced
 I purchased October 5, 2005, November 9, 2006 gave dead battery
 It made year 4 weeks
 To compare, 2 Motorola H500 made 3 years
 I disappointed trash good functioning headset since cannot replace battery
 I intentionally went higher priced Nokia, learn year later poor choice
Next up, look review every bluetooth headset replaceable battery
 

I purchased nokia headset less year ago died today
 Despite flaws I rather liked unreliable nature nokia's products annoying
Like- long battery life- comfortable fit, never falls off
- easy controlsDont like- Drops connection every then- Sometimes calls would garbled require "reboot" headset- Unreliable
 Died 9 months
- Nokia's warranty slow unfriendly- Only supports Bluetooth 1
1Once start using bluetooth, never want place another handset ear
 Unfortunately, bluetooth headsets problems call quality, connection fit
 I guess time start looking devices support new Bluetooth 2
0
 Looking back time I used HS-11W feelings mixed
 Did I like using it? Yes
 Could better ? Very much yes
 

This easy set phone (Nokia 6255i) worked easily


 day two


 We unable answer call w/ BlueTooth, answering phone, headpiece worked great
 Checked w/ phone company today- claim it's software glitch w/ Nokia
 If shut phone off, turn back again, BlueTooth works fine again
 Nokia supposedly working correction program issue
The earpiece comfortable- though little weird looking figure use it
 Hubby came home forgot even take off
 Was handy last night answer phone snowplowing without dig phone pocket, etc
Good Luck
 

I paired unit Motorola RAZR V3 Verizon
 It works flawless
 Prior unit, I Jabra 250 V (broke weeks)and Motorola HS850 head set (returned users end complained static and/or poor sound)
 This unit comfortably wraps around ears stays there
 Only thing I wish longer battery life (Nokia claims 6 hours) compared units sold market
 But plus side unit flash red light battery low
 This big plus since bluetooth devices sold market low battery warning
 

This first blue tooth headset I ever purchased
 I found easy use - clips ear easily slide around
 The sound quality also good
 I happy purchase
 

I really like bluetooth
 It comfortable ear, I problem hearing people hearing me
 The thing I finding people telling hear talk
 Like echo I using device
 I don't hear it, party I talking
 I guess annoying them
This reason I didn't give product 5 stars
 

I LOT difficulty finding kind headset either earbud hook-over-the-ear variety fit in/on STAY in/on ear--When I got new phone (Sony Ericsson W600i) jack standard, wired headset, I additional challenge find BT set features I need want would fit ear stay there--This Nokia fits bill every way
--It's lightweight I'm really surprised people said found uncomfortable I really barely know it's stays place beautifully--It control buttons I ever need they're easy access manipulate wearing it--I initially bit trouble getting voice dial work phone, since learned issue indigenous phone, rather headset and, interestingly, voice dial feature works flawlessly moving car there's moderate background noise, almost quiet room--Go figure--On hand, since feature really significant importance driving, I'm quite satisfied that, too--So far clarity concerned, it's perfect far--I've experienced absolutely static garbling sound clear bell, incoming outgoing--The range-from-phone connectivity also completely adequate--Battery life great thusfar, too--All-in-all considering fact lower end price range BT headsets I looked at, I honestly couldn't pleased purchase would highly recommend it--D 

Excellent features, great battery life I can't stand wear what's point? Never would bought I tried first
 I can't seem get phrase "binder clip ear" head I think headset
 

I originally purchased headset 2006 trying many different styles
 I cannot stand anything ears; therefore earbuds question
 The problem "non-earbud" styles fall ear, hold securely ear hear call
 This unit great compromise
 The thing negative I say become uncomfortable worn constantly, day
 I reasonable luck tilting different position ear reduce possibility soreness
 I mistakenly loaned ex-husband lost 3 years
 I moved unpacking found former junk drawer
 I able find compatible charger figure pair brand new phone, problems since
 I would definitely purchase another one
 

This extremely comfortable headset, light
 It doesn't come off, even jump around lot
You hear party OK, don't hear well
 It sounds like you're box, there's higher-frequency sound
I also Plantronics M3000, sounds much better, falls move much, heavy, brittle external casing
 

I bought HS-11W year ago duty-free shop opted Nokia I also Nokia phone
 The sound reception feeble
 Same thing sound transmission
 Three times five, people ask speak louder
 Once disconects phone own
 Two months ago ear attachement atarted going pieces
 I found three things: a) people problem, b) The Nokia dealler spares stock, c) waranty six months only
 

I love item
 Most bluetooths staticy hear echoes
 That case product
 It works well, comfortable reliable
 I charge several days
 

I thought complaint BT headset would way hooks ear
 Actually, I found pretty nice fit
 It works fine home voice command system phone picks commands
 Once get car start driving goes toilet
 I guess picks much background noise something, absolutely recognize voice commands
 This makes pretty much worthless me, handsfree aspect BT headset important driving anywhere else
Oh, one thing
 I found ear volume much low tastes
 

Got headset 2 days now


 everything seems fine damn uncomfortable


 ears would start feel sore look red approximately 1 hour take switch ear
 I hope adjustment period hopefully ears would get used eventually
 It also easy put headset ear

 hard time one too
 voice quality easeness connect phone breeze though
 

Its simple got lots options good reception too
 

I bought based strong reviews Amazon
 It works Treo 650, it's comfortable (at least me), people I speak say sounds terrible
 Another complaint charger makes sorts high pitched noises it's charging
 Strange, distracting
 I'm looking something else


 

satisfied device, drawbacks fact mic bit sensitive driving roll windows turn radio person hard time hearing you
 becides getting used people looking like talking cant see unit lol
 great product
 

You hardly know wearing although buttons small, easy manipulate
 This works well Nokia 6600 phone
 

I quite satisfied Nokia BT headset
 After trying Motorola H500 Motorola HS850 I thought nothing piece plastic go ear
 The Nokia headset easy use
 Pleanty loud hear
 When work around noisy equipment day problems hearing cell phone
 This thing broadcast power
 There times cuts little bit
 Like doesnt full connection phone
 But that, GREAT buy
 Mine also came car charger travel charger
 This something would go buy expensive Motorola phone car charger order use vehicle
 I cound HUGE plus
 Had I gotten Nokia first, I would never second thoughts bluetooth technology
 By Way, also doubles mic speaker PDA computer Bluetooth
 

This headset really nice features
 It fits comfortably either ear quite easy operate
 Volume level clarity decent, although enough noisy environments
 It fits comfortably eyeglasses
 However, I found mine becomes "garbled" while, become slightly mistuned phone, fumble transfer call phone disconnect
 That quite frustrating you're middle important call
Otherwise, clean, simple design good value makes good option consider
 

This ear piece bought amazon really amazing
 really like think doesnt get better this


its really light compact


fits ears perfectly hard ear
 im extremely happy product
 go nokia 
 

sound clear, lid earphone's part ear fell several days ago, So comfortable use I don't think processing quality good enough
 

This review response vendor, SF Planet, product, beware buying product from
I bought two headsets Nokia 6350 SF Planet
 Neither worked
 After contacting seller, quick send replacements (thank you), guarantee units tested prior shipment
 Unfortunately, neither headsets worked, either
 I looked Nokia manual said ANY 2
5 mm headset would work phone
 I tried four headsets least three phones - luck
 Let's say phone problem
 If case, wouldn't headsets work phone? In addition, product NOKIA, third party brand, reason Nokia compatible product line
I since given trying use wired headset phone went Bluetooth route (not loving it, works alright)
 And sidebar, headset jack work
 I different spare wired headset case works like charm, expected
 

headset working nokia 6350
 waste time money

don't buy similar hand set
 

Nokia Oem E66 E71 E71X 6350 6790 Surge Fold 6010 6161 6162 7705 Hs-40 HeadsetI know head larger average persons
 way large stay ear
 What good hold ear
 

I ordered two headsets two different Nokia E71x phones
 Headsets work either phone
 One phone recognized something plugged made horrifying screeching sound attempting use phone call
 The phone even recognize headset plugged it
 I ordered different over-the-ear headset another supplier Amazon, work perfect
 Overall, disappointed product
 






















































This case surprised high quality low price
 I bought Nokia E71x it's tight loose
 I liked much, I bought one husband's Blackberry since similar size
 I highly recommend product
 

Bought case Amazon Nokia E71
 Fits well
 Good quality good price
 It cost less $10
 You disapointed
 

This universal pouch thus loose Nokia E71, makes handy opposed tailor-made ones snug
 

case made leather
 product description misleading
 case nice slick design made leather
 

good quite
 Good stuff, prolonged use 5 months, split rear clip leather protected him, hurting skin 

I surprised case looks good spite price 
 My Nokia E71 thin silicon case fits holster perfectly 
 Phone holster comfortable belt 
 My concern belt loops belt clip 
 They look sturdy 
 

Time tell holds well impressive first glance
 Appears well-made worthwhile own
 It clean durable looking
 Simple attractive
 The worst failure pouches generally clip fails leather falls apart stitching
 More review time passes
 

When I bought Nokia, came NO accessories; company said working soon
 So I took shot case protect touch screen
 It listed specifically phone time
 Basically it's firm solid cover snaps shut; thick belt hook back makes even stronger, I feel secure nothing going squash skinny Nokia hurt delicate screen
 I KNOW I phone adds bit heft confirm presence
 It's life-saver
 I've dropped number times without damage
 The case STEPPED plastic phone cover split tad
 But without case, phone would totally kaput
 

This nice phone case
 It I expected description website
 I typically like carry phone pocket, however, female wear jeans everyday, I don't always pocket
 This case clip attaching waistband well loops belt
 It fits phone perfectly, magnetic clasp, (which I like), leather
 I satisfied customer
 

High quality, works well, believe theprice then, China 

Works perfectly
 Has belt loops stays securely belt
 I've others belt clips I've knocked machine shop floors such
 No problems one
 (It belt clip also
) 

I bought husband thought phone little delicate him--He drop didn't look fall
 The case great
 It definitely makes phone feel like would protected fall
 The problem I case cut circle control doesn't fit exactly should
 maybe time stretching will
 Other wise works great buttons features phone accessible
 

















































The Product fine, however, photo shown Amazon NOT match photo actual product
 The photo shown includes &quot;hang-up&quot; feature, headset include
 However, box headset came matches UPC page
 So buyer beware - purchase headset based item tech details, NOT item photo, NOT correct photo item listed
 

This try number four get hands free set I put driving kill myself
 The first three attempts ones extended microphone
 They either impossible get properly without lot hassle designed professionals art ear torture
I found model simple put quality sound I receive excellent
 I asked I call hearing say tell I hands free set
 There little background noise quality good
My complaint mute button fragile fallen apart
 It still works bit ugly wires hanging out
When finally gives ghost I buy another one like it
 

This headset worst three I owned
 The sound quality pathetic
 The two cheaper - I bought thinking would fit nicely won't keep dropping out
 Even purpose wasn't solved somehow earglove design digs ear worn cumbersome
 

I Samsung A500 mobile phone
Pros: easy ear, bulky ear piece fit inside earCons: sounds like I talking tincanWhile using phone headset together - sounded like I talking tin can
 I tried calling cell phones normal phones received feedback
 I don't know would function another mobile cordless phone
 
















































Nokia definitely brought lot useful features model, obviously us go unlocked model aware unmatched capabilities handset
 In context, I believe duty caution notes purchasing Integron Technologies (unfortunately, I don't know merchant featured link fares; feedback might apply it)
 I would given 5 stars product, experience purchase
First off, something hidden words "BRAND NEW
 UNLOCKED
 "3" BRANDED PHONE" appears Integron's product listing: The phone arrives "opened" factory seal packaging broken - merchant's version (before I returned item) 'normally' open box Nokia's original packaging make '3 Branded'
 May it's me, I admit I don't understand intent branding new unlocked phone
 While handset could possibly 'unused', repackaging content, lot dust accessories, running loose box 'open box look' create apprehension mind product's condition
Having seen 'Open' packaging, I searched UPS box see Integron enclosed explanation, I realize packing slip all
 At this, I started suspecting UPS box tampered with, I went product manual check standard accessories; - "Finnish" language
 Without packing slip 'unreadable' manual, way knowing received everything original Nokia box also contents box genuine Nokia products (unless already bought handset another vendor opened box Nokia store - sure many would chance that)Within minutes, I raised service call Integron find happening

 response week (their website displayed 'temporarily unavailable' days - might coincidence - I almost believed I taken ride malicious site)
 About 10 days purchase, I received e-mail stating product new, opened make branded don't 'normally' send packing slips
 There contact name number mentioned anywhere (come on, dealing call girls, two-way communication channel essential ensure business transparency)
 Anyway, I sent another e-mail, yet another couple days

 word merchant
At this, I logged claim Amazon's A-to-Z guarantee
 Hats Amazon's customer service, I started getting calls Integron 'enquiring' issue
 However, kept justifying position I already lost trust merchant (Lack timely responses & contact details irresponsible replies like "we cannot wrap cables exactly like Nokia does" much take me; seemed didn't understand true meaning 'customer service')
 I ended returning item getting complete refund
I would definitely suggest buy great product another merchant even better, directly Amazon
 Believe me, extra money might shell out, buys lot confidence purchase
 
































I travel work I always cram car charger, wall charger headset phone laptop bag
 Then I would always loose one items would get tangled
This great product concept - portfolio holds receipts inside portfolio three pockets hold products
 One product COMBINED (one unit) CHARGER FOR THE CAR &amp; WALL
 This great
 charges phone either car hotel room
 The headset good car holder conventient hold phone car
 The car holder works carrying case holster, great phone
I also bought one wife doesn't even travel combined car wall charger spare portfolio me
 


















































This battery gave phone great boost -- it's like new phone
 And price affordable
 













This product purchased expressed intent upload/download update phone book, pictures, music ringtones SamsungGleam SCH-U700
 The product description promises gleam, actual product cannot access anything telephone book
 waste since get free software cable $5 another vendor rather price paid amazon
 

I amazed I could find 2 software vendors provide software necessary extract pictures cell phone 1 extracts videos
 Fortunately, Mobile Action useful tech support extremely helpful
 

The loose screw probably typeing review I can't get work
 














































































This worst set I've ever owned
 The handsfree set even usable - I barely hear person I'm talking everyone I called said couldn't hear me
 The charger really slow it's charging phone all
 The holder poorly made
 Don't waste money
 

For money nice kit, unlike kits cost much phone cover made leather clear plastic face belt clip cover fits phone like glove
 The kit also head set hands free operation power cord use car boat way power outlet (cigarette lighter) 

This starter set Nokia 3120
 The auto home plug chargers fine
 The earphone pits
 The sound quality poor plug broke 2nd use
 Very poor design poor quality plastic plug
 

The headset working consistently
 At times, person end unable hear
 It stops functioning randomly
 Guess pins missing connector
 

The phone cover charger kit perfectly fine, however headset included terrible
 The cord phone earpiece far short comfortable place phone shirt pocket, holding close chest
 

For car cord, leather case earbud price amazing
 I always like carry spare car cord kit I got car cord great price
 

For price, kit can't beat
 The component worked quite well several months without issues
 



















This holster fit phone perfectly, cost far less Nokia version
 I would buy heartbeat
 

I used week abandoning it
 The good news kept phone handy, easy extract phone needed
 The bad news grip loose, release trigger caught everything
 My phone self-ejected three times every one time I really wanted pull out
 

This holster small works well
 The quality good price
 


















































The BLD-3 model two different batteries: One Asian market one US market
 The Asian market batteries slightly bigger recognized phone
 The batteries I purchased Asian market work Nokia 6200 US phone
 

battery sucks
 definately used
 old battery even better one 
 lasts 1 day
 

excellent product
 prompt delivery considering postal strike on
 company used courier extra cost me
 phone works first bought it
 nice get brand name
 didn't expect that
 going "london drugs" telling pay 80bucks new phone
 like old one fine long remains compatible
 thank much
 


































































































This best cell phone case I ever used
 Its really tough
 I pool maintance rub case stuff day
 It shows little signs wear, silver buckel scratche thats ok
 At first I afraid magnet would hold flap down, I yet phone ever fall out
 

I've case week, I love it
 I concerned magnets affecting phone, I've noticed difficulty far--I've got iPhone 3GS, haven't problems it
 The magnets powerful, though--at 6 inches, distorted color CRT (old-fashioned cathode ray tube) monitor
 I didn't get magnets closer, I didn't want put "hole" image, magnets screens
 The case secure, really good fit
 (It provision expansion--two snaps back provide two lengths "tongue" bottom case, making room shorter taller phone
 I love color, too--it's beige


something little different black, black, black
 I wear pretty narrow belt, belt loop case sliding back forth (no fault case--just result narrow belt), I tether belt loop velcro cable tie
 

This probably best cell phone case I've ever purchased

I LG Cosmos Touch rubberized protective case, fits perfectly
It's easily accessible needed well protected
I'm pretty rough cases far case done it's job
The magnetic flap pretty strong cause phone go "Bluetooth"mode







but CURE I always put phone back screen facing inward, took care problem
I really like case
 Good job Naztech
SteveM 









































































wont change phones needed new charger
 boy happy 

Not much say - it's flimsy plastic charger works perfectly
 

I'll keep simple


works GREAT, dirt cheap
 A++++ 

This charger advertised off-brand, is
 And wondering, it's seller's brand either
 It works fine, I penalized star lack disclosure off-brand
 



























































































Works charger should, easy plug charge
 Great travel easy pack
 

I expected big old charger model instead I got small charger newer Nokia models
 They simply mixed I guess
 

Works well
 You can't beat price I problems (I've several months)
 

The basic charger basic old Nokia
 My UK charger American adapter work charger arrived good time job
 Thanks
 

Beware product
 It Nokia models: 1260 1261 2270 3285 3220
 If another model listed description, look elsewhere charger
 

It works like supposed do
 Moreover, it's cheap
 


























































Cons: construction material strange first, almost feels cheap, light- joystick keypad weird use first, I got used them, I don't complain much
- wireless internet- software ultra fast, going happen smartphones/pdas market
Pros:- Amazing photo camera phone, easily compeats lower end digital cameras
- Works great TomTom navigator 6- AMAZING batery life
- Great audio quality music (MP3, radio formats)- great screenI always loved Nokia, opinion one best phones market, I'm really pround (bought quite cheaply Europe)
 I would say together small/ultracompact laptop makes perfect combination business fun
 If dont small laptop, maybe consider buying PDA full keybord wireless internet connection instead this
Overall, I highly recommend product
 

















Does job perfectly, problem all
 The noticed sometimes troubel hearing me
 They comlained voice low speaking distance not

 But overall great headset

 Good build quality


 

This headset I use without people complain able hear correctly
 I hear clearly hear cutting out, fuzzy speach, ringing, hollow sounds
 I wish I could find headset great would fit Verizon cell phone
 

I one 1st came out
 I lost years I ordered one replace it
 I use nokia 6800
 It works well
 Call old fashioned I prefer corded headsets don't charge them
 This one fits securely ear easy use
 It would nice seperate volume control overall good product
 For less $4 hardly go wrong
 

































































































Pros: Great Camera, WiFi, Bluetooth, Sharp Resolution Screen, compactness
Cons: No autofocus press camera button
 Can't find decent carrying case it
Overall 5Features 5Performance 4Price-Value 3I've owned lot mobile phones, I Nokia N93, N73 N80
 I also Sony Ericsson P990i Sony Ericsson Cyber-Shot k800i
 I love mobile phones
 This phone I like among N-Series phones size it
 Very compact compared bulky N93 remove lens cap capture quick photo
Also, screen phone amazing
 Very sharp
 WiFi comes handy times I need download huge attachments surf internet
 All all, nice phone tech heads there
I didn't like fact I paid little $800 3yr replacement warranty CompUSA
 The phone $499 NokiaUSA website CompUSA sells $699, I guess I want peace mind expensive purchase
 

I k790a phone finally decided I willing pay $200 extra WLAN, WLAN useful I expected
 It works great strong signal pre-configured, expect able wander around use free WLANs walking around disappointed
 It takes time set network phone lists network places laptop solid connection
 But work screen large enough look almost website
The Camera great bright environment photos worth saving, dark still takes photos fun worth keeping, (dark grainy)
 I also noticed slider little loose even though slider phone still need lock I find annoying
It fits comfortably pocket worry camera lens seems like easily scratched given cover
Overall I happy I I might choose k790a use extra $200 upgrade little sooner
 

great phone, nice audio, cam awesome
 nice aplications, anyway nothing complain
 really great phone
 

People don't get phone

 This phone every bit great people say is
 Actually, technologically savvy almost anything thing beauty
 But major problem w/ phone year case 8 months sliding mechanism gives out
 More specifically, ribbon cable attached slider
 This ribbon cable turn activates screen phone slid open (or closes slid shut)
 But time cable gets worn eventually screen goes white cannot see damn thing screen
 I research nokia website
 Much written nokia repair forums
 People refer 'white screen death'
 Because soon happens, phone completely gives (in majority cases)
 I currently fighting w/ nokia I send new piece
 Not I use again
 But sell make money
 I give phone 2 stars phone awesome worked
 

product came like new


 works like new either


The complaint I tryed order another sold out




Good seller 

I got phone iPhone 3G due features blessed with, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Infrared, USB, FM Radio, 3

PS And Bluetooth available headset also file transfer unlike iPhone
 

Is whole year since bought phone
 It great
 Unfortunately finally gave me
 The screen went white end it
 But phone worked great
 The picture average
 I loved that
 The internet faster phones
The colors great, ability download themes screen savers too
 Over great phone
 

I really enjoy using phone, features useful, plus option intalling new applications expand capabilities
 

It great phone basic features need,the thing battery last long keypads function says manual
 

I personally fone, everything nice, it's limited software use plus battery problem
 everything else cool 

Mobile Nokia, durability, ease use reliability
 I pleased n80 feel really came new world super cell
 I recommend purchase cost benefit, n95 still fortune never recommend purchase iphone ipod unusual iphone certainty still full bugs
 Nokia forever
 

fantastic item
 I love phone
 It works quite well 

I N6260, rotating screen, I really wanted upgrade N93, way way expensive, thus I reluctantly bought N80 instead
And course I miss rotating screen, I find keypad small fiddly, phone feels small short hand I talk (not surprising, 2 phones N6260 N9500 communicator)
Besides, keypad glides open easy, phone unlocks bag, makes sorts phone calls, makes pictures

how annoying
That sort NON-THINKING side mobile phone designers
 you'd think started designing stuff yestarday
And finally, camera - I find much upgrade compared 2 phones I own
Feature I love real simple transfer data, including pictures, phones, I believe Ns feature
All all, XTREMELY UNHAPPY paid 700 bucks it
 

This phone stunning
 I Sony Ericsson K790a I got phone in, promptly returned Sony phone
 The screen single best screen I've ever seen portable device
 I great vision I can't see pixels, resolution tight images interface looks amazingly smooth stunning, even
 The screen easily readable outdoors, doesn't serious reflective problem like Sony's K780a
 This phone actually smaller K790a, feels smaller pocket
 The K790 big bulge camera is, one flat back, makes far comfortable hand
The controls take getting used to, get down, pretty easy navigate
 Some might complain slow, place I really notice viewing text messages, it's THAT slow, it's still rather zippy
 Texting N80's keypad dream come true, keys responsive, feel well made
 They far enough apart make texting dialing easy
I phone slightly slide pocket, enough screen turned on, needs latch closed position little securely, sliding mechanism feels sturdy well built, balanced holding ear texting
The N80 won't give fantastic battery life use lot phone calls, last day two without charging mess interface, text, make brief phone calls
 After 2-4 hours phone calls, battery life drop bars, I've never die me
It's best looking phone market, silver version (which I got) looks fashionable chunky bloated like smart phones
 The camera phone OK, nothing special
 Every picture I've taken far relatively fuzzy, focus, colors accurate photos still far better phones
 The camera front N80 nifty, I never use it
 It's nice anyway
The expandable memory phone important, play tons Flash games, music, videos
 Music sounds good speaker, plenty loud
 Callers sound crystal clear N80, say hear much clearer old mpx220 K790a
 I terrible time hearing people K790a, device wasn't loud enough
 It could phone though, I'll never know
 It comfortable talk people device slid open, hold closer mouth ear time, works fine without open, callers hear well
If like options, phone you
 You adjust anything it, makes customizable set exactly like it
 I'm new Symbian, far I love it
 It looks better Windows Mobile, and, again, it's configurable
 I suggest downloading themes net (on PC, transfer N80)
 There really cool ones there, I found one I really love
The N80 doesn't sit flat surface, switch back switches camera macro mode
 The top part phone rests tiny switch, makes kinda unstable wobbly, doesn't bug me, I wished sat flat surface
 The N80 volume rocker, I used without
 Instead, use directional pad raise/lower volume
 This works okay, take phone face order change volume, could easily solved simple volume rocker
 In fact, 2 buttons sides unit, power (on top) camera button (on right)
 This good thing, pick N80 without pushing buttons
 On K790a, many buttons crammed onto sides every time picked I pushed one, got annoying
I wish I got black version, silver nice too
 Fingerprints show silver version rather easily, though screen generally stays clean, recessed
 The shiny area around buttons shows prints, cleans easily, Nokia includes soft cloth this
 I wish N80 came case, include headphones, USB cable, 128 MB memory card
In conclusion, buy phone
 It blows many smartphones water integrated wifi, music bluetooth, IR, it's amazing screen
 It may pricey, it's well worth it
 I got mine Nokia directly
 Avoid TigerDirect, sent 2 Russian versions K790a row, allow NO returns cell phones
 

I must say I'm impressed phone
 I bought mainly WLAN functionality, tell works best expected
 Actually I'm writing review using phone, connected Home WLAN (with WPA2 Security activated)
I like online everywhere I go, don't wanna pay expensive cellular data plans (using GPRS)
 So WLAN I use dedicated apps phone like gmail, google maps, Yahoo Go
 Windows Live Messenger I'm caf&eacute; another free hotspots
Preinstalled software phone includes: Quickoffice (for viewing Microsoft Office documents), Adobe Acrobat Lite, Music Player, Flash Player, Real Player, Voice Recorder, excellent Web browser, Movie Director (for edit videos), Kodak Mobile (so share photos Kodak web site o order online prints) useful utilities like file manager application manager
Need apps, wanna change phone look carry favorite mp3 songs? Ok, although phone comes 128 MB miniSD card, notice enough
 So buy miniSD Card (at least 1GB) surf web download hundreds free apps including ones I mentioned earlier (Be careful

 apps harm phone, download trusted sources) buy specific apps handango online buyers
You take breath-taking photos 3 megapixel camera included phone
 You choose 8 different shooting modes manually adjust features (shooting frequency, white balance, exposure, color tone, sharpness, brightness, contrast color saturation) use self timer could included pics
 Video quality nice also
 But want digital camera performance you'd better buy digital camera
Battery life could issue, especially use features intensively (FM radio, Music player, Internet Browsing, play games it) better additional charger you
 A tip could help save battery: go Menu - Tools - Settings - Network set Network Mode "GSM", phone won't look UMTS networks
Worried specific carrier MMS, SMS, E-mail GPRS settings? Nokia Setting Wizard (installed phone) work you, choose country carrier voil&aacute;
 All settings configured
A last comment


 I prefer Stainless Steel black one
 

FEATURES: In addition basics high-end unit, N80 comes equipped w/ uPnP, WiFi, video calling & recording & streaming & editing, Adobe pdf, flash player, powepoint, Excel, Quickoffice, VoIP capability, 3 megapixel camera w/flash & zoom, 2nd front video & camera, 256mb removable memory card (NOT 128) handle 2gb removable memory hold 500 songs, FM radio, 2 browsers - 1 robust 1 WAP & download Opera NetFront well make 3, equalizer, Symbian operating system allows endlessly customize unit w/ programs, USB cable, stereo bluetooth & headphones
 You download podcasts well Google maps
 You store entire movie memory card w/ space left & play 'wirelessly' another uPNP device (computer, tv)
 You bluetooth tunes auto w/ bluetooth like iPod
 Quad band 3G-WCDMA, bar code reader
 Exceptionally bright, large, vivid screen
 A ringer w/ option announce name caller
 Insanely loud ringer & speakerphone
PERFORMANCE & USE: The 3rd edition Symbian MUCH faster 2nd UIQ
 Lag time greatly reduced
 If you're used smartphones, you'll 'get it'
 If not, N80 frustrating
 This casual caller
 It takes lot codes Nokia update firmware
 It takes knowledge access points relative carrier
 It takes lot configuring, reading & little trial & error
 These flaws, somewhat par course camera-quality phone w/ 2 browsers, full media player & WiFi
 For simple callers, don't pay something won't use confuse you
RELIABILITY: It's fairly new phone & I've short time
 However, previous phone Nokia 6600 smartphone I 3+ years
 It workhorse
 I've used net airports hours time
 I've downloaded tons programs
 To date, runs like beauty
 If that's indication Nokia's smartphones general, I happy camper
 I've ZERO problems w/ Nokia smartphones
 The N80 solid, small, thick phone
AESTHETICS: Well, that's subjective, I find silver better looking, less typical, less safe cheap-looking black unit
 Sliders don't take well cases leather case must adjusted operate unit crystal case crack month up
CONS: Sending items via bluetooth isn't reliable w/ 6600
 It receives files reliable, sends files computer every try
 Not big deal
 Battery life, expect w/ unit much? Let's unreasonable
 


but could little longer
 Takes configure connections & download updates which, again, expected packed media & business smartphone
 The cursor makes navigation easy misfire large fingers
COMPETITION: Then there's iPhone N95
 The iPhone RAZR high-end phones
 It's stylish great marketing campaign
 For want function, take note iPhone one less megapixel, video calling, removable memory card, MMS, uPNP, FM radio, etc


 costs marketing
 It's showy simply league
 The N95 exactly competition due difference price (+$200-300)
 For extra, get couple megapixels, GPS enhancements
 I can't justify paying amount 2nd laptop upgrades N80 aren't significant
 No unit comes close yet sheer size N80 quite small
 As PDAs (Curve), none features N80, QWERTY keyboards which, N80s features, doesn't quite tip scale favor, especially PDAs run addtl $20-30/mo net access & none offer much
BEST PART: If you're American using phone AT&T;, must pay kb net usage
 WiFi, however, make less issue
 As may use VoIP sevices, needn't eat minutes, that's issue you
 I suggest, however, using phone w/ T-Mobile
 T-Mobile charges flat fee web usage even w/o WiFi, won't break bank
 T-Mobile also offers minutes dollar carrier
 Notice American carriers offer smartphones w/ service plans
 They offer QWERTY PDAs
 They found Americans willing pay addtl $25 QWERTY keyboard
 We 'smart'phone users know needn't pay extra hop net
Sorry long-winded, it's testament exhaustive features small, flies-under-the-radar unit
 If want Cadillac, get iPhone, it's blingy & less reliable
 If want Benz, get N80
 That's really comes to
 

I phone almost 11 months, truly tell certainly worth money
 Having received free upgrade network waiting list while, I found difficult recommend anyone
The phone sleek superb sound quality
 The clarity vocals second none, Nokia really sets benchmark
 The music capabilities also outstanding
 However doesn't really balance sorts shortcomings phone has
The ABSOLUTELY worst 'fault' phone battery life, please fooled thinking battery become issue, certainly be
 Do expect exceed past 1-2 days without charge, even minimum usage
 Also, design fault fragile charger unit means, vulnerable breaking, even careful owners
However, battery life prolonged switching '3G' functions, something many network providers make impossible custom software
The second problem unreliability phone
 It 'WILL' crash, calls, calls, become exhausting annoying
The slide function also prone opening pockets also annoying
If patient person, phone might you, price I certainly expected handset
 

feature really got buy product wifi feature well 3 mpixel flash camera


 met expectations I disappointed
Connecting home WAN breeze continue browse, chat using phone wife browsing laptop (although I laptop, nothing beats browsing lying sofa bed)
The camera wonderful I started regret buying digital camera


 flash good great

 but, I dont take pictures total darkness, fine too


 Flash + night feature nokia phone enough get good picture night night light acceptable (though want professional looking picture, go buy SLR something)
So many complained battery life, you, like me, used Panasonic X700 before, Nokia Phone heaven sent
 The Pana Phone lasts 12 hours standby mode
 This Nokia Phone lasts 4 days straight standby mode
 Just initial 16 hours charging fine


 You able browse 1 hr, take 30 mins worth call, play games 1 hour phone could still last 2 days
so over-all, satisfied phone


 look apps though coz Symbian S60 v3 backwards compatible


 




then probably best buy
 I looked N93 - size put off
 By picking N80, miss 30fps video recording (you get 15fps instead) - get one best phones appealing form factor
 I upgraded overused 6600 N80 - improvements OS, form factor, performance quality impressive
Pluses:- Wifi works great
- The web browser shipped phone one best Ive seen mobile devices
- Very intuitive user interface, you'd expect Nokia
- Good camera, fairly extensive settings (including white balance)- Ships virus scanner
- Supports TLS/SSL IMAP email accounts
 The 6600 didn't, major issue me
Minuses:- Lifeblog proprietary doesnt work out-of-the-box blogger wordpress
- Battery life anything impressive
 I use voice data pretty extensively (1500+ mins/month) need charge phone everyday

With program call SimpleCenter, I take picture phone show image PC monitor wirelessly
 There glitches there, overall phone pretty good
 Size good, screen nice
 If want Nokia, one I would buy
 

Well start 



 ITS A NOKIA
 For people complain battery, keep using phone use battery
 For 5-10 minute calls 4-5 day wont use much battery
 Plus use much 3G functions must charge phone eveyday
 Otherwise battery much much better Moto RAZR V3i I had
Usability phone average, navigation button flimsy thick fingers phone you
Camera good
 3M makes good pictures
Wish LCD screen little bigger
 But clarity contrast amazing
 High resolution too
 Heard N95 better many ways
Wi-fi first confusing get used it, breeze
 Google maps works great bigger screen would nice
There limit size mini-SD card use 2GB bummer
Overall good phone want keep within budget dont care moolah go N95
 

Nokia well-deserved reputation quality hardware (radios, mics, camera slider mechanism) stable OS reputation evident particular handheld unit
 This called "Internet Edition" 


 there's internet browser board allow user surf internet despite presence WiFi radio
 The entire "internet" experience use VoIP
 The N80's three major features (VoIP, camera music) come addition excellent GSM cell phone, mixed
 I find VoIP service potential treasure *softwares* photography music are, me, disappointment
Two VoIP carriers, Gizmo Truphone, service softwares N80ie
 Since Gizmo software already onboard, I chose Gizmo
 And, unlike Truphone, Gizmo attractive CallIn service
 Imagine US European expat living Latin America WiFi home able receive calls, 24/7, flat rate $36/yr friends relatives US/Europe dialing US/European number
 The international use VoIP could easily pay N80ie (or Nokia's N95 also comes Gizmo) modest time period
Will carriers able fully respond competitive threat 4th generation technology VoIP? I doubt home business WiFi networks mostly fully paid subscriptions newly installed 4G cell signals extend miles cover costs -- look Sprint's massive WiMax (known "WiFi steroids") losses see costs implementing (what call) 4G large urban areas
 VoIP WiFi-enabled handheld incredibly cheap compared future subscriptions 4G WiMax networks carriers investing heavily
 So 


 every reason carriers put pressure handheld manufacturers stop mobile VoIP across already-paid-for WiFi
The N-series Nokia Gizmo's VoIP service available N95
 That popular/expensive handheld overcomes several issues: unit slightly wider screen larger, 3
5mm audio jack present bluetooth includes remote control protocol
 Both, however, imposed software limits one measly minute voice recorder case someone idea podcast files developed either VoIP enabled handhelds
The potential drawback investing use mobile-Voip Gizmo online help poor I, least, worry Gizmo's long term survival unless bought company serious commitment customer service
The photography music softwares handheld disappointing
 On posiive side I admit impressed onboard photo-editing software
 And I'm attracted idea resident software allows one directly upload photos WiFi online service
 But already paying subscribers Yahoo's Flickr, know that, upload photos Flickr, retrieve originals unless pay Flickr $25/yr
 If want avoid charge, it's attractive keep one's originals computer and, one going store originals computer, editing computer since need see-to-edit 2048x1536 pixels (= 3
2Mp) severely limited screen 1 3/8" wide
There features N80ie undermine value camera phone, viz
, absence autofocus significant shutter-speed delay
 The best part camera phone ease I could transfer photos MacBook via bluetooth
 I've decided keepmy photo albums computer online Google's WebPicasa service
 But I would occasionally like friends see photos handheld small screen N80 largely undercuts wish
But take large screen store play music and, help matters, Nokia's loudspeaker excellent sound quality
 But might like use headphone headset: The first problem Nokia's proprietary "pop-port" elminates usage headphones standard 3
5mm audio jack
 But Nokia's bluetooth easy use supports A2DP stereo protocol, use wireless bluetooth headset, especially since allows hands free driving
 But alas, support remote control, AVRCP protocol
 Once you've gone cordless sound, it's surprisingly natural want reach stop/go fast-forward buttons earphones (where sound emerging) rather fumbling phone-in-your-pocket, latter you've got go w/o AVRCP
There pretensions high-end camera and, consequently, I wasn't disappointed photos I've conveniently taken handheld
 But 


 one would like ability easily organize ample number photos pieces music
 But onboard softwares organizing one's photos music were, someone accustomed iPod, iPhoto iTunes softwares, major disappointment me
 Had I spent many hours dinking hoped-for emerging photo library trying get unit work well music device, I would gladly allocate 10 stars outstanding dual mode VoIP/GSM phone Gizmo board
 But I've subtracted half-dozen points time I squandered false hopes
 

It's realy great phone
 The menu simple intuitive, configuration realy simple
 The sound loud clear, good reception
 The lcd display really great, bright colours great image quality
 The funcionability best, wifi realy easy use navigation realy simple
 The camera gets good pictures light good, video
 The voice commands realy great simple
In hand, battery life using functions realy short, talking it's fine (2 3 days) use music player wifi (especially last one) extra battery need close charger
 



























































































































































In addition charging Nokia 6620 phone, device provides convenient place "park" cell phone I get home
 Before I got charger, I would always pick charger wire floor fish behind dresser
 Now, I gotten inito habit automatically placing phone charger I change street clothes I get home
 And I never forget pick phone charger I leave house
 Great device
 I've often wondered manufacturer Nokia make similar device
 

Great charge Nokia phone battery time
 A space saver carried traveling
 






If fit ear buds ears, sound good
 The anti-tangle feature every phone cord come with
I think people actually use headphone incorrectly
 If used correctly, mic comes chest
 I believe, oddly, connect clasp cord together around head - like necklace
When that, earbuds - secure little square rings hang untagled chest mic half way chest
In configuration, whole thing secure, untangled eminently workable
Everything good, except little button doesn't appear work I don't get good press answer, hang-up voice command stuff I would like
 

These little earbuds offer surprisingly good music reproduction
 I tried Nokia HDB-4 boom set awhile wanted stereo better bass
 The HS-3 delivered easy manage configuration
You can't really see pictures- wires enclosed clear nylon mesh resembles braided wrap inside shielded audio cables
 This outer wrap helps make HS-3 wires much less prone tangling affords strain-relief way pop-port connector
There also pair sliding square rings slip earbuds ears- keep buds snug little controller/microphone switch; another effective anti-tangle touch adds ease use storage clever little headphones
Although I don't like microphone way sternum phone calls, addition mic allow fast answer incoming calls option unplug headphones carry conversation using phone itself
When using phone radio mode, answer switch also serves radio station frequency changer; press answer switch selects next station phone's memory- handy extra radio surfing
I sure wish I'd bought HS-3's here- Amazon price quite bit less Nokia website
 

This thing weird, get it's pretty cool
 First off, ear buds huge
 If small ears won't comfortable you
 Second, cord really long useful annoying
 Third, wires wrapped plastic weave far stiffer regular headset wire (but well protected you're that
) Fourth, microphone sits around level waist
 It's miracle anyone hear you, somehow Nokia figured (although supposedly sounds like speakerphone echo
) If get it's awesome accessory
 The phone interruption feature push-button answer sweet radio works well enough
 

I purchased headset 6230 provides stereo sound plus connector phone won't block charger port
 When using headset actually get higher volumn using handset, gets pretty loud crank way up
I usually get 1 bar signal I work calls always breaking up, one day I found I headset plugged I actually hear clearly still 1 bar signal, somehow helped reception although user manual 6230 says wire acting FM antenna
 

I one people reviewer advised steer clear headset
 Only, thing is, I dont particularly small ears
 Hence, Im afraid people find set pretty aggravating really press earpieces set earlobe
 30 minutes later ears pretty sore
 Also, sounds quality isn't really great either, especially bass
 On good side, anti-tanging system shave valuable seconds disentangling cord, depsite anti-friction coating, still occurs
 

Seems pretty simple CD included
 Newer software online Nokia--but I could get connection Nokia 6820 gave up
 At least cable cheap enough
 No idea I failed cable incorrect
 

Really fast delivery
 And great price, I may return computer runs withVista particular cord seems uncompatible
 But, would definitely order guys again
 

Item shipped promptly would work
 Called assistance told drivers, cable can't bad
 The drivers supplied didn't work I downloaded many different drivers none would work
 

The cable simply DOES NOT WORK
 The PC detect phone
 I wrote seller telling cable DOES NOT WORK
 They wrote back requesting SKU number cable package
 I emailed SKU number them
 Then wanted cell phone model number
 I emailed info
 Then sent email telling "the cable fully compatible" phone, I make sure I latest software drivers
 I already downloaded latest Nokia PC Suite (which contains drivers), I emailed back telling so
 Then wrote back telling make sure PC detecting cable
 I wrote back explaining that, yes, PC detect USB cable, phone
 At point offered free replacement
 I wrote back stating I willing try replacement cable, I willing pay shipping
 They sent new cable
 The replacement cable DOES NOT WORK
 Basically, company selling product DOES NOT WORK
 Considering number reviews stating cable work, considering company *probably* received numerous emails customers telling cable DOES NOT WORK, I *suspect* company knows selling defective product, I know fact
 My advice purchase seller's cable
 Save money, even dollars
 (Incidentally, I read previous reviews prior purchasing cable, I would purchased one
 Unfortunately, I see reviews I purchased cable [


]
)Update: 6-13-2010 - Today I received Nokia brand CA-42 cable I ordered
 It came CD driver cable, version (7
1
40
6) Nokia PC Suite I already downloaded Nokia web site installed includes necessary drivers, I need use CD came cable
 I simply opened Nokia PC Suite clicked "Click connect phone" start connection wizard
 The moment I plugged cable phone PC detected it
 I problem problems all
 By way, Nokia brand cable, end connects phone six little wire pins sticking out, two six pins longer others
 The non-functional imitation CA-42 cable wire pins away across end cable, pins length
(Psst
 I got 2010 Ferrari California copies sale
 Just fast original
 $1
93 each, plus shipping
) 

Yeah want, Nokia really cut corners bundled software
 What headache, still cheaper getting screwed AT&Ts file transfer rates
 

neat cable, good connectors, haven't established communications PC cellphone cable yet
 

Connects old Nokia 6820 laptop
 Just aware emulates COM port thru USB
 Make sure COM port set correctly Nokia PC Suite match virtual COM port assigned driver
 This check Device Settings Control Panel
 I need set COM port COM16 every time I plug cable
In short, product works - long willing put bit effort
 For price, good value
 And saves turn bluetooth - slower drains battery faster
 

I bought phone save photos computer
 It works well
 And also easy install use
 I happy it
 

I 6102i installed drivers cable Nokia's software XP computer
 The software saw cable attached never saw phone
 I tried find updated drivers, luck
 I called store, shipped new cable
 Same problem
 Tried uninstall drivers use Nokia's software
 Still luck
 After phone tested, I've concluded cable/driver problem
 Guess get pay for
 

This item exactly half I wanted laptop - allowed connect computer old Nokia phones
 This allows edit backup contacts (3588i, 3589i, 6610) send backup SMS (6610)
One part work Plug Play
 Each time I plug cable computer I need tell Nokia PC Suite look COM9
Because Plug Play doesn't happen seem work Modem functionality
 I plugged 3 different phones Modems (3588i, 3589i, 6610) case Connectivity Cable Driver add appropriate devices Device Manager
 Without devices phone cannot act modem laptop
It noted product isn't proved fault
 Until unless I get genuine Nokia cable I know maybe Nokia software blame
 But limitations setup
This item includes USB-Phone cable, packaged CD including Windows drivers, guide (MS Word doc), Nokia PC Suite version too
 This quality package two dollars so, need do
I followed directions worked, although probably need like I pay attention advice change COM port (as viewed My Computer -> Device Manager)
 On laptop meant changing Nokia program reference virtual COM port 9
I also followed advice Nokia software install let download current version PC Suite
 But great CD included version bootstrap process, instead go Nokia website
 

It little janky, finally worked
 I connect disconnect cable several times checked internet tips get work, I can't complain--I got work, downloaded info ancient phone, I wanted
Good luck
 

After looking reviews, I thought I'd jump hoops get cable work
 It worked fine me, I'll describe I others
Computer system: Windows XP Professional Compaq 6910pPhone: Nokia 3120bWhat I did:(1) launch Nokia PC Suite (v 6
85
14
1)(2) plug cable phone computer's USB port(3) put cdrom cd player(4) start / settings / control panel / system / hardware tab / device manager* Here yellow "other device" list devices alert option install drivers* I clicked install drivers, chose install software automatically
* Windows found cdrom installed software(5) After installation, device manager showed "Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COM6)" "Ports (COM & LPT)"(6) In Nokia PC Suite, I chose settings / Manage connections
* Choose Serial cable (CA-42) click "Configure"* I chose COM6 (use whatever port matches one shown step 5
(7) In Nokia PC Suite, I chose settings / Add phonesNokia found phone world smiled little 

I unable give kind review item since I shipped wrong cable
 On positive payment refunded I required return ship incorrect item
 

I impressed price-to-value even including shipping charge
 The fact seller includes Windows USB drivers (that I don't use) bonus wasn't expected
 Delivery fast, packaging protective easy deal with
 I highly recommend product seller
This matter people, USB end cable converter lets easily adapt cable uses
 In case, I using cable monitor Rom Monitor embedded Linux device, Patriot Box Office
 To this, need remove proprietary "Nokia end" replace standard CDROM four-wire connector
 The built-in converter makes possible cheaply easily diagnose issues system level embedded Linux development work
 

Product cost reasonable, arrived good order
However, different phones need different cables
This fit phone, although model number ofmy phone listed
 

I bought ran setup file find drivers files meant xp
 I vista good
 I don't experience phone data cables I cannot figure out
 It would nice included instructions
 I get feeling I wasted $5


this official nokia cable I saw posts forum people saying need different drivers order work
 The links said drivers posted 5 years ago dead
 It may 6800 locked, I'm sure tell not
 Perhaps I try backing contacts different phone/cable
 Ah well, live learn


 


















































































































































































































































































































































Do waste money product
 I ordered doesn't work
 When it's plugged phone make call, person end cannot hear cannot hear them
I thought must 'mute' button pressed accidentally something, alas - doesn't work
If got one work, may OK I wouldn't take chances
 The over-the-ear part isn't even comfortable
 













































































My new Prius Bluetooth capable, none phones compatible Virgin Mobile Bluetooth capable
 I need hands-free phone use car, $20 Nokia brand speaker/mike/charger perfect
 The "earphone" speaker right behind head easy hear mike boom doesn't get way picks voice perfectly
 It even comes excess cord taker-upper velcro/adheres someplace way
 Well designed, Nokia, well made
 














I received Bluetooth 11/5, would charge
 I took Nokia shop, deemed defective
 I mailed back 11/8/07 PRIORITY MAIL (at expense) CCM Accessories instructions replace Bluetooth refund shipping costs
 (Haven't heard word)
I called CCM Accessories 11/19/07 8:30 AM
 The CCM guy said would call back hour
 (That didn't happen)
 I called 1:15 PM 11/19/07 guy answered
 He said would send e-mail call next 24 hours without offer resolution
 I told I want refund, didn't respond, I hung up
 (CCM Accessories shown VERY POOR customer service skills 718-606-0395, resolution Bluetooth)
 CCM Accessories money cost extra money I NOTHING
 

speedy delivery, product promised
 good seller
 thing headset button boom hangs call
 thought volume button hung people couple times - paranoid hitting trying adjust earpiece conversation
 

I hands free ear bud much better comfort seems clearer ends
 The mike picked lot extra noise one doesn't
 I like tap answer hang feature never go phone
Chas 

Opinon reserved 'till experimenting
 Admitedly non-gadget friendly, I successful determining hear person end
 The device came instruction
 

I ordered headset trying I never used again
 I could hear call AT ALL person end trouble hearing me, even I shouting
 I tried I house minimal background noise - I'd car way either us would able hear one
Do buy product
 








Works like supposed price reasonable
 I like kind ear bud head set personally
 Would buy one broke
 

shipping fast, quality earpiece really great, best all, it's 70% less market price,great buy
 

This headset works well enough, it's annoying Nokia chosen nonstandard jack it
 Standard headsets course cheaper available wide variety suppliers, get one easily office supply store need quick replacement
 Also, headset tends come unattached fairly easily bonk phone take pocket
 

Got headset Nokia 6102
 It's far cheaper service provider, exact product
 It takes bit forcing get attached, works well sound quality good
 It's bad phone don't take standard 2
5mm headsets (there adapters want go route though)
 

I've used headset exactly like paid $29 it
Yes exactly one you'd buy Nokia dealer
 I'd recently bought new phone really wanted Blue Tooth
 I'd tested several couldn't decide
 As I never use phone driving unless I'm wearing headset, I decided go back 'trusty standard
' This on/ff switch important even works 'voice tags
' I honestly couldn't believe price wish I'd ordered two time
 Shipping fast
 Definitely recommend
 

The product description indicated Nokia Headset Nokia 6085 phone
 Unfortunately, upon receipt headset, fit phone
 The seller kindly refunded purchase price, well
 I'm still attempting locate correct headset phone
 

This first headset taken lot abuse getting stuffed bag, jammed inbetween car seat, stepped on
 Thumps it's durability
 And quaity good, great
 

I bought wife birthday
 She really likes it
 Good sound
 Good value price
 

Works great mom loves them
 Blue tooth much hastle
 Keep simple
 

works year, else want something costs less $5 including shipment? I always order spare one current one works, use without interuption 

sound volume talk hands free much lower though, comparing headset, sometimes creates trouble, especially im loud places
 But aagin, price- nice product 

This great price good product
 Service fantastic
 Very quick shipping
 The negative high shipping cost low price made it
 

I previously bought one Nokia 3100 worked perfectly
 I subsequently bought 2 I could keep one home, one work, one car
 It looks different original headset included Nokia, works well
 

I got one two others broke
 It's basically one comes phone except comes cover part goes ear
 

This transaction great
 The delivery time merchandise I expected
 I would business vendor again
 

The headset works, sponge cover earpiece
 I tried contact vendor, never got response
 Be warned 
 What see picture receive
 So much good customer service
 And I thought Seattle/Bellevue commerce bad
 

THIS FIRST ORDER OF NOKIA WIRE-phone headset HS-5 WAS OK, BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER WE ORDERED TWO ADDITIONAL OF SAME PRODUCT, THEY CAME AS DIFFERENT STYLES AND FUNCTIONALLY DEFECTIVE
WE EMAILED TO THE SF PLANET, BUT THEY HAVE NOT SENT ANY REPLACEMENT
 

It worked 2 weeks, I dont think I trust buying electronics online again
 

This transaction truly awesome
 I received item way ahead indicated time I pleased quality item
 Thanks awesome experience



 

fast ship, product works great, exactly like original nokia
 cheap knockoff
 

I've got Nokia N75 got order facilitate answering calls road
 While I usually don't like talk cell phone driving, sometimes can't miss call
 This little gadget really good w/the ability answer/end call via cord-mounted button, it's heaven sent
 Would've given 5 stars, radio/music-player sound would've bit better
 

I bought Nokia came stereo headphones usually tangle I like
 So mono headset it's one cable plug go, cable mess
I even use radio feature use free ear keep touch rest world driving, walking, etc
 

I enjoyed product
 It lasted far longer cheapo models I bought
 I guess oem best
 

I like headset



it rough used


yet works fine



Nokia phones great voice quality speakers tad bit low


otherwise great product



 

Item arrived expected, work model phone claimed web site
 I wrong connector type
 Be careful ordering, lists phone type compatible, doesn't mean actually is
 

The delivery estimate Jan 11-Jan 18; I received January 10
 Very fast great service, much better expected
 Product works expected
 

My ears small side, ear bud wouldn't stay put long
 Also, cord felt taut short
 It unsafe playing driving worth money return it
 

I bought ear phones Nokia-6133 working well
 feel worth buying quoted price
 

The product serves purpose


and replacement Nokia supplied headset broke
 For reason I never get good wireless headset hence preference wired one
 This good, issue I call answer button, hard like rock


I really need squeeze it
 You get pay I suppose
 

I'm happy
1
 Was able find another replace mine went open connector
2
 Even Better



they changed right-angle wire entrance allows put phone slide-in holder without "squashing" wire, afraid would shorten life/break mic wire leads
 I'd putting phone "upside-down" long time, prevent wire damage, snagged time/coming unplugged lot
 Still took wire damage anyway
3
 Always thought sound quality good
4
 Love ability keep tucked shirt quick "stick ear & answer", using inline module answer/call end button
 Don't pull phone answer call
5
 UNREAL price Amazon, dollar



but shipping sort high
 End price still $5, compared maybe $20 elsewhere
6
 Do NOT like Bluetooth units: big ear, inconvenient take & (compared near-effortless use one), need batteries, doubt sound better, etc
Thanks, Nokia
 

I bought product amazon
 The one I recieved however doens't look exactly like one pictured here


but one recieved clear crisp
 I love it


 

The headset works exactly advertised, good price well
 

It doesnt stay plugged phone
 I dont think new one
 They start falling alot wearing out
 I phone long time
 Never earpiece new
 

I never got product, I made mistake adress, gave credit next order, thanks
 

I ordered Nokia headset phone I almost 8 years
 The headset arrived 2 days works perfect
 This real bargin $3
10 

Fast delivery works perfectly
 I purchased 3 Nokia earbuds hard find
 I would buy 

Using hands-free device much easier holding phone ear
 Both I person I'm talking hear well
 The drawback earpiece tends fall ear I'm moving around, I imagine would case device type
 Overall I happy product
 

This product functions well
 A little hard connect phone whenyou get used becomes easy
 

I recently ordered wired headset cell phone
 I purchased one retailer paid $35
00 it
 This one mailing Great purchase less $6
00 
 I happy
 

Comes loose open plastic bag that's buy bulk packaged, ship one
 It indeed new price good
 Works great
 

I bought product Bluetooth enabled phone died I point contract I couldn't get new phone free
 I went back old Nokia phone, actually great phone, Bluetooth
 Since I sometimes use phone car law California use hand-held device driving, I found little doozie Amazon
 It works well certainly steal price
 The problem little difficult connect-you need two hands-so really need connect prior starting drive
 The earpiece little bulky, too
 It's still great little device don't plan leave ear day
 

I purchased headset go cell phone
 worked great last
 broke within three months
 

This headset inexpensive works well Nokia 6102 phone
 The speaker clear microphone picks well
 

I use mine Nokia 6850
 It hands-free unit also "enhancement" allows receive FM radio
 I use time, one complaint earpiece huge ergonomic all- like trying stuff penny ear
 If fit better would block external noises too; I always turn volume way hear anything
 The answer button nice, plus never call people accidentally I sit activates voice dialing feature rather acting another "send" key
 I foresee wire failing meets base connector, price can't beat
 For shortcomings I listed I love thing
 

Great Service, prompt delivery, product excellent condition
 Will shop again
 Terrific customer service
 

Always winner - I'm always trying replace damaged lost one
 Nothing else compares
 

The exceptional thing worth mentioning "hands free" device price- I first got phone, old Nokia 6102b, I bought headset nearly identical Target $16
00
 Seeing one listed price incredible really makes wonder way things work
 Why give away?That said, works well one
 Didn't come three different foam earpads immediatley lose, though
 It seems OK I need, violation new California 'hands free' law
 I stil actually talked anyone, messages I left home machine intelligible, barely, I could hear outgoing message well
 As long I windows rolled up
I still believe holding phone one's head distraction driving, conversing
 Which I rarely it
 Even Bluetooth requires little input phone, it's still totally hands free
 But talking someone vehicle truly hazard still resolved new law- say nothing scant sign people respecting it
I seen one result though- great number people seem think less shame walk around public little Borg headsets place
 

Too GREAT price even paying shipping pass up
Works great also, wish ear-plug rather ear bud




personal prefernce all



 

Had get one stupid new law
 The ear buds cheap work fine
 


Nokia HS-7 Hands free head set, designed do, nothing great work, need hands free incoming calls great
 

This product exactly advertises
 It works well, I hear perfectly, microphone good picking voice, comfortable
 I bought before, I lose again
 

This useless NOKIA 2600 advertise
 I complained seller
 NO RESPONSE
 BUY IT AT YOUR RISK
My money gone forever, seems 

 

I bought replace damaged set kind came phone
 At first I bought set earphones local shop, I couldn't get used listening conversations one ear
 Even mono, two earbuds improves sound lot
 

This great company deal with
 They one believe customer service
 I continue order them



Speedy delivery time
 

I dont feel confort product
 As saw it, tought returing moment
 Some feelin odd it
 

The replacement battery I received holographic Nokia logo sticker that's original (OEM) battery
 The replacement also doesn't hold much charge
 It's comparable OEM, AFTER OEM used years
 Ironic, considering point purchasing replacement charge would last longer
I purchased 3rd party vendor, Amazon
 After I brought attention vendor, refunded money assured genuine I'm still skeptical
 

The battery works well, brand different NOKIA
 Is original battery
 

It lasts day
 The original battery came N80 last 3 days
 This one doesn't even look authentic package open
 

It exactly listed



works great



no complaints



on time



I probably buy another another spare one
 

I bought Nokia phone trip England 2008
 It cheap obsolete model
 The phone worked well AT&T Go Phone trips Europe
 Preparing trip Spain, I discovered original battery wouldn't hold charge
 I surprised find I could buy new battery elderly phone
 The new battery holds charge week regular use, month backup phone
 Very pleased I could get another trip old phone less $10
 

Works well, fit many new phone styles
 Easily plugs car charger
 Infinitely adjustable
 Overall works great
 




Ordered item
 Received MBC-15S, antenna coupler
 Sent order back sent another MBC-15S, wrong item again
 Returned again
 Now told problem widespread send another item
 Also, idea right item ever stock
 Think blew advertised wrong product low price
 Bet won't ever offer item described foe $14
99
 Maybe fess screwed up
 

I ordered MBC-15S-AC, received MBC-15S DOES NOT antenna coupler
 

After reading first review, I emailed customer service find description accurate BEFORE I ordered
 I referred back description; I figured checked
I also received MBC-15S part, NO antenna coupler, I sent back
 

I place order 17 may 05 MBC-15S-AC Mobile Holder Antenna Coupler got order 20th great
 If right, holder I recived MBC-15S I really needed part's right first time
 

I odered Nokia MBC-15S-AC Mobile Holderwith Antenna Coupler received MBC-15Swhich DOES NOT antenna coupler
 You sent holder package
 That sucks


 


























































The NOKIA E61/E62 already large phone product makes far bulky
 And snap close well
 

The case fits perfectly, unlike one size fits look
 The workmanship excellent too
 Also worked belt clip previous case different cell phone
 The draw back I found new belt clip didn't hole attach cord chain clip
 I've managed knock belt clip cell phone causing early demise phone, safety chain would asset
 

The price great, shipping cheap quick
 The case fits cell really well
 I searched box stores even cell service provider stores
 I could saved bunch time I went Amazon first place
 

I bought Classic Multidapt case Nokia 6682 flew air fell pavement
 This case totally awesome; fit perfect, quality strong leather, spring clip detachable
 The back case pull expose camera lens, attaches 2 buttons velcro, perfect
 The front clear plastic press phone buttons pretty good
 You see picture case manufactures website
 The model#87125 case
 I highly recommend case Nokia 6682
 [


] 

Great somethin Son able protect cell phone
 Makes fully functional & I don't worry much breaking it
 

Fits 6682 snugly
 Good quality
 Excess hole top-right, three half bucks who's complaining? Only annoyance: overpackaged item I've ever seen


 

PROS: The product fits snugly phone gives comfortable feel
 Its sloppy like cases
 Worth every penny spent
CONS:The special outlet memory card reader perfectly alligned position phone
 There extra opening phone top right corner accomodate N80 camera
 I'm using 6682 dust keeps getting in
 

used case several months quit headache giving me
 kept pocket due (unnecessary) holes case, speaker, data port, what-ever-the-thing-on-top-does, case fills sand kinds bits stuff
 collecting behind plastic makes screen visibility difficult lighting conditions
plus friends made fun case :( tossed it
 































































































































I one usually leaves OEM screen guard phone company provides
 Having item allows change plastic cover whenever deteriorated plain scracthed
Price little steep good use me
 

I bought phone replace aging motorola
 The phone worked fine 30 days started need re-charging frequently
 As today I've two half months needs re-charged every night
 Nokia let send look policy loaner means I buy another phone anyway
 My conversation Nokia's repair service ended conviction I never another Nokia product
 Admittedly partially due unanswered emails I sent prior calling them
 

PHONE HAS HELP UP WELL
 BATTERY LIFE IS EXCELLENT AND PHONE SERVES PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PURCHASED
 THIS PHONE IS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE SAME MODEL WHICH I HAVE HAD FOR OVER THREE YEARS
 

great phone would given 5 stars USB connection, doesn't
 

This worst cell phone I ever owned
 The call clarity horrible, instrument panel clumsy design, software lag according T-Mobile insider won't last year let alone 2-year contract T-Mobile made sign-up phone
This first phone Nokia (I always happy Motorola) dissapointment
 But I went ahead got 6133 two faulty 6103's
 The 6133 good phone 


 everything says well too
 




















































































































































DOA
 Same story reviewers, charger work, little red LED functional
 This JUNK charger, don't waste time money
 

Does work


 I tried Nokia 6101 charger


 Just message "NOT CHARGING"


Will return piece junk 

Bought two Christmas; Feb 1st, thing worked little red LED
 The first time I tried use first one, I got NOT CHARGING message phone
 When I tried second charger, I didn't even get that; red LED still works well both
 I guess still get cheap junk pay dollars
 




























































































































It's amazing stylish, light powerful wireless accessory found enthusiastic owners users yet
 I gone thru Bluetooth headsets like candy (Jabra, Motorola, Plantronics


etc) I pleasure introduced fantastic powerful gadget, basically given finding something REALLY worked
But now, Nokia come superior sound quality input output, also done small form factor elegant hip 'jewel' like twist envied others
 I HIGHLY recommend easy use, comfortable accessible headset warriors need something works beautiful too
 

I won headset raffle, first Bluetooth headset, I Treo 650
My experience:1) Everyone sees ear says thinks: "Why USB drive ear?" 


just doesn't look right
2) If phone close (3 feet), gets static
 (my phone talk bluetooth laptop 15-20 feet away 


so phone probably issue)3) People tell can't hear well I use it, perhaps hear background noise
I'm purchase different Bluetooth headset 

wouldn't recommend one
 

Had one spilled coffee bought another white love it
 Great noice reduction haven't found better one yet
 

The chain Bluetooth headset hilariously awesome (and actually useful)
 For lack better phrase, totally blingin'
 The headset tiny, I wouldn't way
 I don't like sport things like Gladys Symbols many others do
 


















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Nokia know better
First let tell sound great speakerphone
 I small Celica, car filled sound powerful speakerphone
 The mic sounds clear (or I hear friends), I problems it
Here issues installation
 First cell phone requires new back (battery cover) work stand
 I switch battery covers every time I need use stand car
 Next, phone holder comes SCREWS dashboard
 I go Home Depot buy heavy duty 2 sided 3M adhesive get unit stick dash
 There way I putting screw holes new leased car
 And finally, wires
 You serious wires running around dash unit
 There wire phone speakerphone, speakerphone car charger, mic speakerphone
But


 Despite it's shortcomings, unit's quality performance lets recommend anyway
 After all, comfort I worth wires hassle I went install
 

The installation difficult, though I didn't actually use handset mount (I find easy dial picking phone)
 Running mike wire fairly simple figure routing wire (be sure won't come lose drop peddle area)
 The fault I I get frequent clicking noise phone plugged in
 It doesn't seem engine related, it's bit peculiar
 I yet call Nokia, however
 All all, lot better headset


 

This product works great
 Good sound vehicle people hear clearly
 The 2 downside issues noted reviews worth repeating: 1
) Installation isn't easy (my Lexus dealer mine pulled dash wire microphone), 2
) You need either replace backplate every time place unit cradle or, I've done, bite bulllet keep bulkier hands-free backplate phone time (has large clip back hold phone cradle)
 Sound great though
 UPDATE/REVISION: After while, mine developed static another reviewer noted above
 After sending speaker (which hardwired cable connects phone itself) back Nokia, promptly sent new unit everything works great again
 

Car kit works really well
 I advantage 6160 car kit installed I replace phone holder plug mic I already installed old kit
4 5 stars phone holder doesn't 'rock solid' feel 6160 kit 

This clip designed use Nokia car mounting kit
 As stand-alone clip can't stay on
 The clip doesn't enough clearance simple belt, doesn't enough holding power
 




This stand converts existing charging chord charging stand
 It works well much easier (and looks better) set phone stand end day charge
No complaints, works described
 

I quite disappointed find receiving must also buy charger actually charge phone
 It's nothing plastic phone display stand
 What ripoff
 

All plug AC adapter charger thing complete ease comes charging phone
 Works great
 

I item, description incorrect
 It second port charge spare battery, allow charging battery without phone
 Look larger picture see one two-prong connection, slot perfect size 8290 phone, way big battery itself
Also, keep mind stand come power supply
 You must use adapter came phone purchase additional one
 

I bought one these


and works great
 I go week depending much I use phone talk without battery going traveling
Plus, half weight extended life battery I used this
 This battery buy want extended life battery
 

This battery still really light, thinner 750mAh version is, really last forever
 But VERY thick
 I mean really thick, fit desktop charger (if once), easily fit pocket
 It also doesn't fit well belt clip either battery pushes phone away you
 It light, extremely light battery much power, I batteries smaller ammount power, albeit, weighed more, still preferable me
 It says does
 It lasts forever, it's really light, thickness matters warry
 

I've owned one batteries 3 weeks recharge twice
 It really lasts
 It's lightweight size


deceptivly light weight
I've able leave charger home I've taken business trips
 I've pleased it
 

I bought battery heavy cell phone user, 2000 minutes/month, I looking something long talk standby times light weight
 I've tried so-called super capacity lithium-ion batteries, they're heavy
 This polymer battery weighs much less much power
 It's battery I use phone I highly recommended it, even you're power user
 If you're light user you'll rarely recharge it
 

I like extra capacity battery, extended standby time extended talk time
 I also like price versus performance
 It fits okay belt clip
 However, doesn't fit standard Nokia car holster kit, fits albeit loosely third-party generic phone holster, I'm concerned might stay place sudden stops jolts
 Good really need extra capacity, fact costs less standard Nokia battery
 

Using standard Nokia battery, I could go 5 days,given amount time phone on, amount I talk
 Withthis battery, I go 6 (occasionally 7) days
Is 20%improvement really important you? Is worth [it]? (I gotthis battery special


 amazon, I still feel I got abad deal)
Don't believe anyone says go 25 days onstandby, it's going happen
 

This battery didn't last longer factory-supplied battery
 I left overnight 75% charge remaining
 When I woke morning, battery completely dead
 Also, others said, battery big fit easily cell phone case, pocket, purse, etc
 

I owned battery 6 weeks
 It super battery offers consumer new cutting edge technology
 The battery super light, very, thin gives Nokia cell phone completly different look feel
 This probably safest cell phone battery ever developed
 It also environmentaly friendly
 The battery long talk standby performance
Women especially like battery extremely light, easy carry purse
I highly recommend purchase battery
 

Finally, thin light battery lasts
 It turned Nokia comfortable, light weight phone
 I change phone I found battery
 

As preface, I experienced heavy mobile phone users
 I mobile nearly 6 years now, I 4 services, 5 different phones
 I love Nokia 5100/6100 line phones, battery fits those
This battery amazing
 It way light, way small (these good things
) I really believe enough power average mobile phone user charges phone every evening
 And user would impressed it's size weight, great unit
 However, I must say - me, quite enough power
 I known better 750 mAh, I wanted something thinner
 I use 2500 minutes month phone, get idea ussage patterns
 It last way MOST days me, days doesn't problem
 If use 1500-2000 minutes less, probably greatest batter could ever own
 My plan get companies 2100 mAh version battery everyday life travelling (where I might charge every night), keep amazing small one evenings, less weight pocket handy
 I highly recomended battery everything advertises, more
 Just aware extremely heavy user
 

Had mine month now
 I think well worth price I dont ever get shut lack juice
 I've waiting long time new technology everything web sites said would be
One nice thing battery &quot;memory&quot; issues recharging
 

This battery's amazing
 It lasts days it's super lightweight
 It's hard believe there's really battey inside plastic case
 It's really slim also
 It's almost like getting new phone
 

This battery extremely slim lightweight
 I carry cell phone belt everyday changing smaller, lighter battery made phone less cumbersome
 The thing I don't like battery limited talk time, 2
75hrs, compared battery I received phone
 The nicest feature able charge anytime Lithium-Polymer batteries build memory
 

I got new battery, REALLY IS like getting new phone
 This battery ONE-THIRD weight thickness standard battery, ALMOST SAME talk-time
 Before buying new phone, check out
 I think you'll like it
 

Excellent battery
 I've weeks I get really great standby talk time
 It's amazing long lasts
I've expensive batteries didn't last long
 This bargin
 I'm getting one wife
 

Despite site note compatible, battery convex surface faces flat phone back
 This fit 5165 model
 I guess I need try someplace else battery slimmer standard unit
 

Despite site note compatible, battery convex surface faces flat phone back
 This fit 5165 model
 I guess I need try someplace else battery slimmer standard unit
 

The advertisement page indicates SEVEN days standby time
 Upon receipt piece crap, I charged overnight 24 hours already lost half charge
Don't cheap buy this
 Go $60
00 one may actually last while
 

I've owned battery year longer holds charge
 I'm lucky I get day normal talk time it
 I'm dissatisfied product
 

This simple little holder grips Nokia firmly, mounted relatively flat surface
 You need one hand insert release phone
 Handy little gadget
 

&lt;sum> I bought great little phone holder almost 2 years ago 


 I liked much I tried soon buy another avail
 


 good tool I think is
 It easy put phone get of
 It won't drop, scratch damage phone
 It mounts nearly anything doublestick tape can't break
 I wish things made simple elegance item
 

I ordered based fact I could adjust would clip air conditioning vents
 However, clips, release button, adjust
 After receiving product, I think description given must different product
 



















I bought Cell-Grip Phone Holder hold Nokia phone car
 The holder works great far phone sliding easily - double sided tape keeps letting go car's dashboard
 I follow directions stated rub area holder would mounted enclosed alcohol wipe wait dry applying tape
 Either tape isn't strong enough, dash somehow hindering ability stick
 Either way, it's kind disappointing get car find phone lying floor


 







Nokia's charger adapter
 My N73's original charger 3
5 mm tip (like older Nokia phones) came 2
0 mm connector adapter
 This one fits smugly onto Kensington's M2 smarttip 3
5 mm tip
 So anyone doesn't want wait Kensington brings appropriate smarttip Nokia's new series, one do
 

I sent Osprey Talon wrong items I returned requested received correct item refund
 Luis Cuesta 

Fits nicely onto Kensington power block
 The fit snug secure enough fall get lost
 






I didn't buy particular charger
 I bought one eBay price
 I don't know they're manufacturer cares? The point it's basic piece electrical equipment that's hard screw up
Even Walmart wanted $20 no-name charger
 That's ridiculous
It's batteries
 The official Nokia Motorola Samsung brand batteries cost arm leg
 Buy no-name one $6 $9 save money
 I bought no-name batteries phone years ago they're still going strong
 

Worth money
 Delivery time
 One wonders come Cell Phone accessories shops sell item $22
00 

I think excellent charger excellent price, I paid $5 shipping included works perfectly
 I definitatley recomend it
 

So far product working fine
Shipment made timely
 I would suggest future buying
 

Great product--great price--very much Nokia's list price
 Just I needed
 Fast shipping
 Very pleased entire transaction
 

The exact Nokia Charger I wanted price much retail 
 Shipping also fast , I got charger within three days placing order 

This called travel charger seems work much faster charger came nokia phone
 This charger fraction price one sold Cingular works well, even better
 

Works fine, problems
 Added words stupid requirements Now I again, more, dumb this?????? 

Very good charger, like stock/orginal charger comes phone
 =)

 Works perfectly
 

This phone charger works fine I saved lot money compared Cingular store Target, etc

 Compatible works like charm Nokia Phone
 

This product matched original charger perfectly great value price
 I using charger several weeks problems, I pleased
 Also, shipping fast easy
 

My Nokia phone old, functional
 This charger inexpensive, works
 I'm pleased
 

Well beyond expectations price
 Extremely well built (by Nokia)
 As happy I could possibly something mundane
 

This OEM much heavier duty cord puts 5
6volts 800mh much faster charging rate original
 As may know Nokia 6015i phone one first digital "not smart" phones push button keys
 I still two in-house calls only
 No land line
 Old reliable
 I carry around LG-GLANCE smart phone magnet snap-shut leather carry case
 

Did work phone, phone smaller plug vendor show good pic description 

Although I complaints service, arrived I pleased
 But wrong charger nokia
 I put model number phone chose charger based that, well didn't fit
 I chose send back would much trouble
 Although I contact vendor I assumed I would pay shipping really wouldn't worth based I already paid
 The service good, wrong product sent not

 Works perfectly
 I couldn't asked better transaction
 I would definitely business seller again
 Thank you

I recently purchased Hands-Free Desktop Charger love much I thought I would
 Although, charging battery much faster, bit convenient desk right next computer, people I talked using say isn't clear I speak using it
 The ease wonderful, maybe something wrong one I ordered only
 It saved lot time computer, even ear-piece phone, still gets way need lot typing shuffling papers
 If room desk, get way
 Buy, enjoy
 




















































































































































































This cell phone awesome
 Nokia makes pretty hot cell phones
 It's pink color made kind girly me, I sold guy suggested purchase black cell phone holder put comfortable carrying around pink cell phone
 It contains lot features make really awesome
 The headphones came phone top line well
 





































































The phone awesome
 Very good reception
 Clear loud speaker
 Highly recommended
 Don't hesitate order now
 

phone came unsealed box
 i'm sure refurb even though sold new
 

I always buy items sold amazon
com directly, one, product gives feeling bought thrid party amazon
com forwarded me
The back cover problem


 

I bought phone last week although I live it, many things bug heck me
I'll list I didn't like:*The screen way small, especially phone bulky
*The screen VERY hard see sunlight
*The 262,000 color screen, well, it's enough
*camera poor quality (it's VGA)*The navigation awkward intuitive
Just pick different phone
 

make clear unlocked cell phones selling cdma work carrier work 

This's good cellphone BUT it's little huge, I'm supposed previous reviews I read it


 personal point view
The cam poor ligth neccesary
 The excellent part save movies want havea large microSD
The menu tradicional easy configure new features
 

If you're looking phone packed every useful feature $300+ phone would cost


 it
 This phone everything I wanted phone: best around reception phone I've tried (quad band), decent camera, excellent hands free (people can't even tell I'm using it), expandable memory, MP3 ring tones, MP3 playback it's relatively quick charging
In opinion, negative part phone size
 It's bulky, due thickness overall girth
 This I gave four five
This excellent phone much less others equivalent features
 

The Nokia 6085 relatively low cost flip phone stereo Bluetooth, also lightweight compact music device built-in MP3 player, expandable memory FM radio
Nokia 6085 good-looking phone high quality entertainment features user enjoy, get almost features usually embedded today's phones, reasonable price
However, Nokia 6085 features low-end VGA camera maximum resolution 640 x 480 pixels
 More features camera include self-timer image sequence
Despite low price, 6085 includes nice multimedia features, best Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)
 The MMS message (Multimedia Messaging Service) include photo video text & music sound complete finishing effect
Other features 6085 include: voice recording, voice commands, plus hands-free speaker; Macromedia Flash Player 2
The quoted battery life five hours talk time 240 hours standby time, held pretty close claims, though usual, use multimedia features drain phone quite quickly
The 6085 affordable phone got features users would want phone today
Overall, good camera phone anyone who's shopping budget
 Weighing 84 grams, Nokia 6085 easy carry around pocket bag
 

The first feature phone needs strong reception
 I one phones ATT impressed got another one Dad another country (Quad band phone helps here)
 I tried Tmobile Sim card unlocked phone
 With phone, I could get reception everywhere inside house
 Tried sim card Razr, Sony-Ericsson, Samsung - get reception near windows
 This point alone thrilled
 I impressed enough reception I felt need write review correct nonsense there
Other pros -Very sturdy build (just like Nokia phones)
Camera VGA takes surprisingly usable pics good color plenty grain light low
Quad band phone - works worldwide
Built speaker good quality - works well speaker phone playing music
Interface totally customisable (big plus me)
 I access bluetooth menu via one keypress
Small size
 Flip design means screen keys protected default
I put 2 gig card - plenty storage videos, voice, pics - phone told use memory default (very convenient)
Bluetooth works well issues using multiple bluetooth headsets motorola jabra
Voice recording works well
Bluetooth works smoothly - stereo bluetooth headset - phone MP3 player
 Complete customisable preset equalizers
Light small
Keys large - easy see - solid tactile feedback
Loud ringer - convenient
Good voice quality - person listening end
Cons -Does standard mini-usb jack data
 Charging also uses custom jack
 This ONLY thing I hate phone
Doesn't "look" good - - good "looks" reception sucks (like samsung)?Video jerky pretty low rez - shoot long want memory card
I get 3 - 4 days standby phones usage thrown in
Radio needs use stereo headset (my mono nokia headset seem cut - I use radio)
Screen marginally better Samsung - rated zero poor reception
No headphone jack - I can't use existing earphones listening music
If reception issues - phone consider
 It features normally use small sturdy flip phone
 Plus - everything works - works well
 

I've Nokia 6085 2 months attest compared brand cell phones price range, far features commonly used-- bluetooth connectivity headset, voice-dialing, easy file transfer/photo storage using micro-SD card, mp3 player, FM tuner
 It also receives well, battery lasting close week alternating stand-by mode "off"
The adverse comments I'll make regards following two things--1
 This phone loud ringer
 This major peeve I product, found trial period many customers complained it
 If you're thinking purchasing one these, go check one phone store
 Try case, clipped belt (or purse) ringer "max" see hear it
 I've tried factory rings, 
wavs, I'm trouble (and yes hearing good
)
2
 Clumsy use controls
 Nokia could done better this--I personally hate dig multiple levels menus find things, making phone's cool features tedious use
 The speakerphone feature, example, default setting, allows user turn "on" outgoing call gone through
To sum up, it's bad phone, definitely value money
 I would advise though check one person see ringer going loud enough you, find/easily use phone's features
Good luck
 

My wife I cell phones year I mixed feeling cell phone
 It free got via AT&T; wireless plan family I much complain
You get ones free Amazon qualifying AT&T; plans services &lt;&lt;&lt;Nokia 6085 Phone (AT&T;)>>> But get locked Nokia 6085 AT&T; phone
PROS:(+) Better average Battery life 3 hours talk time 10 days standby time(+) Music Player plays MP3 WMA, Music Quality good phone price
(+) The MicroSD slot used upgrade memory tested Kingston 2GB works perfectly, You get Amazon &lt;&lt;&lt; Kingston 2 GB Micro SD Card >>>(+) Has FM tuner built-in FM radio (You'll need wired headset act antenna Buy product achieve &lt;&lt;&lt;Black Silver Stereo Headset On/Off Switch Nokia [OEM] HS-23 Eforcity)>>>(+) Has voice recorder Video Recorder capabilities(+) Can play Java Based Games(+) Speakerphone calls decent qualityCONS:(-) The 1
8-inch (128x160 pixels) internal display disappointing part cell phone
 Graphics photos grainy colors seems washed out
(-) VGA camera poor quality sizes upto (640x480, 320x240, 160x120)(-) Does come USB Data Cable But purchased Amazon &lt;&lt;&lt;Eforcity Nokia CA-53 Compatible USB Data Cable Nokia>>>It still nice phone price especially Unlocked Versions cell phones used wireless carriers, expect much Cell Phone better ones today's world clamshell type cell phones
 

phone may look basic, perks unbelievable
 years i've wanting aphone could plug computer download music photos easily
 phone allows (and believe me, i've ton fun it
) create ringtones rather hampered phone company's limited selection ridiculous prices
 download photos computer rather buying phone company taking mediocre shots camera phone
 save ton money you're ringtones graphics - don't pay ringtones graphics make yourself
 far best feature phone micro SD memory chip
 basically unlimited storage capacity files - phone acts USB flash drive
 buy micro SD chip 40 dollars 8 gigs storage phone
 compare iphone
 iphone storage runs - can't plug new chip it
 mention pay hundred extra dollars get 16 gigs storage phone
 (my phone came 512 MB micro SD chip - enough storage - right now)in conclusion, wouldn't trade phone anything
 truly best phone i've ever had
 

Nokia 6085:-On AT&T; Network-Perhaps best Nokia flip phone ever
I would given 5 stars voice recognition > worked &lt;Pros:-Outstanding battery life-Outstanding bluetooth operation-Very good receiver sensitivity (reads weak signals well)-Very fast processor time-Rarely drops calls-Good voice quality reports using Nokia BH-700 bluetooth-Good everyday reliabilityCons:-Voice recognition terrible / unusable / using Nokia BH-700 bluetooth-Faint useable incoming call tone (while bluetooth)My background:1983 AS Electronics Technology 3
05 GPA1983 General Telephone Operators License1984 Began 14 year career RCA / Thomson Consumer Electronics Engineering Technoligist1985 General Class Amateur Radio License 

This actually second Nokia 6085h I owned first one quit working 18 days
 The second one although working failing fast year old
 The issues I model plenty:1) The screen dark dead line across center;2) Frequent SIM Card read issues (there nothing wrong SIM card tried several cards;3) It doesn't ring sometimes call received find hours later go dial one voice messages
 This happened numerous times;4) Finding signal keeping 


 I live shadow cell tower owned cellular provider I occasion phone say service give 1 bar 2 bars
 Very poor maintaining signal;5) The camera really suck I didn't get camera;6) Holding phone placing finger thing top outside portion screen cause person talking able hear you; basically dropping call;7) Not especially durable, said plastic feels fragile is
Some good things phone:1) Good volume control;2) Apps good;3) I found menu navigation pretty straight forward;4) Once get USB data cable transferring files easy allowing select mp3's ring tone;5) It likely good phone I think I got unlucky ended two lemons
 

This great phone even don't plan traveling


the fact it's unlocked alows freedom so
 

I purchased cell phone supposedly new warranty
 Right 30 day product warranty ran out


wouldn't know it, liquid screen went phone
 They told ALL parts covered warranty EXCEPT liquid screen
 Of course
Very poor quality


 







































One person's long winded opinion Amber 7370
About Phone Itself:I ordered phone another merchant last week
 When came I excited; everything I expected be
 It cute I received many compliments it
 There people actually asked was
 =)The phone sturdy I don't think falling average person's pocket hands onto ground would much damage
 The twist feature phone unique didn't take much time get used it
 The size screen great; I think it's much larger phones incredible considering size one
 The back phone Nokia describes faux-leather adds nice little contrast
The sound level phone average ringtone volume good different levels it
 It vibrate feature well
This phone bluetooth also fantastic downloading themes ringtones made downloaded others
The phone arrived text, multimedia internet settings T-Mobile easily fixed Nokia's website
 If search phone page section downloads send information service provider directly phone text message
 All open message settings put in, piece cake
There also 1
3 megapixel camera pretty cool
 If large fingers though plan rough time hitting button actually take pictures
 I don't abnormally large hands I struggling push button correctly
 That also goes power button side phone
 It small looks like something need search paper clip pen tip depress
 I able successfully accomplish two tasks I see may issue some
About Bands:I didn't know much "bands" difference "tri-band" "quad-band" (that means there's one more, right? *smiling blankly*) I received started using it
 This phone tri-band missing 850
 I would full signal one second, nothing next calls dropped every minutes
 After research I came realization phone missing 850 band Cingular uses (around area anyway &lt;Cape Cod>)
As I said before, phone came settings T-Mobile installed I'm pretty sure would work wonderfully service
 I can't say anything brands service it's definitly worth call company find out
The Good:~ Stylish~ Sturdy~ 1
3 Megapixel camera~ Bluetooth~ Large viewing screenThe Bad:~ No 850 band~ Very small buttons power cameraIf phone worked service I would happy probably wouldn't part it
 There definitly phones bells whistles chances good you're looking phone style
 





















































































































































What I say? I needed cable get photos phone laptop job
 

Awful
 Cable fit phone
 We squeeze hold still would stay
 The software seemed outdated
 Do NOT buy cable
 The good thing cheap
 We didn't bother return 1 cent
 

great product great price


 shows bad retail stores screwing us over
 

When I Purchased phone could use mp3 pictures
 After purchase I discovered needed cable download music I find cable $50
 There way I going spend paying $100 phone service
 I happy see Amazon much cheaper I trust products
 

This cable came good price ($
01) ^_^ Plus shipping course, makes putting thos pictures computer much easier don't card reader
 I used email pictures order get them
 Not anymore
 Other reviews recommended going Nokia web site downloading software insteard using cd, that's I I haven't problems far
 

The cable works sender prompt delivery
 By using product save time take tiny MicroSD card possibly losing damaging 
Plus, computers SD card slots; USB allows universal approach
 You simply used cable flashdrive like device download free software Nokia
 Data transfer slow large files however benefits weigh detriments
 I would highly recommend product
 And proprietary pop-port attachment I'm sure useful future Nokia phones
 

Great price, quick shipping, packaged well
 I'll definitely use SF Planet something I need
 

Cable Nokia 6133did fitThere mis-match cable end fit Nokia
 SF/Planet rebate cost
 

The illustration may generic, get correct USB Nokia model
 With Nokia's software, up- down-loads fast easy photos, music, lots stuff I don't bother with
 The main thing get right cord, pay tiny fraction you'll pay cell-phone provider's store
(I also bought one 6650Fold them)
 

Got cable fits, connect pc matter I do
 I wonder issue pc, cable, cell phone
 I strongly believe pc since I tried connect wife`s pc work either
I returning right away
 

The first time I attached phone - one plastic pieces go phone snapped phone - I couldn't get phone connector
 I bring phone T-Mobile dealer could remove it----carefully - way I gonna try get stuck damaging phone buy new phone - $2
00 cable

 Couldn't use - worth pay shipping send back get new one again
Ended buying card reader thumb drive
 

It's exactly ordered, price good
 The software came date, easily fixed visit Nokia site
 

I give item five stars does, complain that
 Also, construction pretty sturdy concerning link/phone cable attachments
I originally got I sound file computer I wanted used ring tone (make sure they're proper sound files proper size, i
e
 Midi files @ like 3
5kB, etc)
 Once get cable comes CD easy installment program (more like simple window) computer recognize phone
Once connected, it's simple another hard drive, disc memory unit attached computer
 You open window browse phone files like computer's documents
 Depending much memory phone holds, take sorts doc
 computer store phone, think like memory stick [again, phones don't come lot memory, thus upgrade + couple gigs] Be wary, I tried storing word document it, store
 However, can't open phone, wanted store safe keeping (or transfer another computer) could
 *** If you're thinking linking two computers, make sure software cable installed computers wish link between
 Or, phone memory sticks come big bigger adapter housing plug camera, computer sort attachment
The software also great little window allows manage music files playlists phone
 The format really easy follow, think like zune, ipod, media player
A perfect buy phone whether it's making select files easy store, personalizing phone one step beyond
 
























































































































































































































































































































































I first purchased item fit Mp3 player big
 Hey, fit cell phone T
 I love case clip, doesn't become loose use, holds matter job I ( I'm assistant manager lumber yard)
 






























This perfectly lovely little leather case 


 unfortunately phone I bought (the Ericsson T19LX) doesn't fit it
 Note Amazon
com: Since doesn't fit, shouldn't listed accessory T19LX
 This one's going back, I'm afraid
 

I received mine I like far
 It looks good (I've received two compliments styling) definitely keeps phone safe
 I already craked face regular leather open faced holder, phone popped clip one many times went I bent pick something
 I wish maybe model swiveled, I think best option holster I phone
 Easy answer calls use earset answer button cable
 I like magnetic snap front-- I get phone pretty quickly
 

This phone NOT fit Ericsson T18 phone, pity, it's nice item
 All squeezing world wouldn't get phone there
 

The pouch handsome, magnetic clasp nifty, little bulky
 It fits Nokia 8290 nicely
 Unfortunately, snap, used secure pouch place belt, broke two days wearing it
 This item going back
 

I've owned couple different phone pouches
 I would rate one pretty good except


 It defective snap belt loop I hate send things back mail
 



















The leather higher quality cell phone pouches, product fairly useless average user
 The magnetic clasp seated *just* right doesn't hold
 You can't use phone pouch
 The thickness leather muffle vibrating alert point might feel it
 Lastly, says &quot;large&quot; pouch, phone fit battery larger factory provided one
 

































































































































































































































































































































It's nice enough head set, didn't get use much
If still phone goes too, work fine
 















































































































































































































































































































































































































































I bought item $20, lasted five hours snap broke, seemingly accord
 I wouldn't buy again
 





























































































































































I first tried Motorola V330 return calls would cut-off reception always low
 Someone store recommended phone I couldn't grateful
 It works like dream
 My voice conversations crystal clear phone packed plenty features, i
e
 side color lights would blink new message missed call, even silent mode, awesome
 It friendly customizable, tons options far cases side light colors
 I hooked PC DKU-5 cable within minutes load screensavers, contacts, calendar items, I connect Yahoo Mssgr/ AOL chat right away, etc etc


 

My girlfriend tired paying arm leg call me, since T-Mobile I Verizon, decided get phone plan
 The sales rep T-Mobile store offered us phone charge
 I've never camera phone before, decided get it
 It turned nice phone
At first little difficult get used to
 The menu button indeed difficult push, although I yet screw options pushing wrong
 Other that, there's much complain about
 At first difficult hear, I realized volume turned almost way default
 The speakerphone greatest
 It's rather quiet, sometimes I'm heard end line, turned call connected
The lights cute
 The first morning I I set alarm, I idea lights would flash alarm went off
 The phone sitting desk across room, woke up, I thought desk fire I saw blinking red orange lights
The camera decent
 I hardly ever use it, I I get rather good pictures despite size
 I don't know anyone would want good quality camera cell phone
 If you're looking one, buy normal camera
 Maybe cameras crappy cell phones built in


The phone withstands abuse I put against
 It's dropped, thrown, stepped on, sat on, I even ran car
 Other replaceable covers scratched up, phone survived
 If rubber side pieces come phone still warranty, T-Mobile replaces free
Overall it's decent phone
 I wouldn't pay phone I could help it, one exception
 If get free, not? 

I got phone I got rid Motorola C650 (i'll buy product ever again)
 The color display excellent bright
 Selecting menu little bit troubling, takes time get use it
 The camera takes great quality pictures (compared last two camera phones I owned: Sony Ericsson T610, Motorola C650)
 This phone ring
 The themes phone awesome, choose predefined themes customize way desired, customize them
 The ringtones come selected phone aren't great, send 
wav 
midi phone save them
 There isn't much memory phone, delete themes you'll never use clip-art you'll never use
 You insert clip-art pictures edit them


neat feature
 The covers aren't hard remove replace design back provided template
 The speakerphone pretty loud fully access menu conversation
 YOU CAN'T TURN OFF THE SOUND TO THE CAMERA
The phone nice size, little heavy, great display
 

Pros:LightsGreat gamesNice menusGreatly lit screenVoice recorder (up 5 minutes
)Call recorderDecent camera video abilityNightshotChangeable/customizable back coverX-press fun shell (comes seperately)Great reception (for anyway)Cons:No bluethootNo InfraredNo FM radioCamera quality great, decent enough meMemory kinda poorOverall: Despise flaws, Nokia 3220 still great phone It impress people around even days
 Very cheap pay-as-you-go capability
Why get it: If teen, yound adlut kid, like stand impress people, you
Why shouldnt get it: If plain person try Nokia 6610i
 I fyou dont care extras video, games changeable covers, phone aint you
 

This phone appeal want something stand little bit
 When get call, lights outside go crazy people first see like (of course get tired turn off, would you?)
 The menu button sometimes hard hit you're impaired fat fingers, shortcut arrows feel right
 The pad comfortable rubber nice touch compared plastic hard-to-hit buttons phones
 The stencil cut-out make back phone sweet, i've never tried appreciate option
 This fun phone like smart shortcuts easy navigate
 Only four stars camera leaves much desire, especially compared ot others' camera phones
Pros:-THE FLASHING LIGHTS-Personalization stencil-Reliable, good service-Long lasting battery, recharges fast - dont leave long malfunction (left mine months started acting weird/over-heating battery)-The keypad comfortable, fat fingers drunks beware menu keyCons:-Camera lags, impossible take instant pictures, flash (night mode doesnt see anything clubs), zoom pictures taken already-Scratches little easily, especially compared flip phones
 If you're clumsy isn't phone-Video recordings aren't good-No mp3 (fix: record favorite song(s) hit "set ringtone" put one ring profiles)-Maybe one good default Background/Ring, take picture background record ringtoneBottom Line:Don't buy you're gonna use camera like crazy limit apparent shortly
 Buy want stand fun,reliable,user-friendly phone also camera must save moments 

yes bought phone couple weeks ago, know read reviews one says can't mp3 ring tones, well that's kinda true
 can't download t-zones, record recordings gallery set recording reingtone
 sound, sometimes better, FREE




 That's right coolest phone ever



 

I use phone lot
I loved phone I first got it
 Its durable good tend drop phones bumpers
 A month after, though started problems
 First reception good, number keys didn't work
 The bumpers also started rub off
 

I loved thing I got year ago
 Since weird stuff covering lights side peeled off
 It really gross
 Never touch it, four peeled slowly, I'm sure that's good
 It decides wants ring ringer wants use use
 No matter many times I go change ringer sometimes use default T-mobile one
 Other complaints it's great phone
 I love Nokia, cheap, works
 

One absolute best features phone "disco" lights loud, distinctive ringtones (preprogrammed)--this phone incredibly easy find bottom tote bag one leaves shelf, closet, pocket, etc
Agreed reviewers main menu button frequently gets confused functions, ie I trying scroll phone numbers I accidentally open camera, thing
 That annoying time consuming, still happens even owning phone 9 months
So now, I lost phone trying weigh disadvantages advantages
 In comparing something like Razor, I would miss Nokia's informative lights--that alert simply inert, perhaps lying desk-- activity happened (such missed call, text message waiting, etc
) On hand, phones bigger screens, higher volume listening calls, newer technology, etc
Am undecided moment
 

bought samsung e715 last time USA
 phone simply great except took india, signal reception became bad
 couldnt get signal within house, kinda heart city

 time wanted settle nokia phone, know nokia known reception customizable features
so let start pros phone:1
 small size2
 rubber grip good prevents small phone slipping hand3
 rubber keypad- keypad design innovative makes usage easy inspite space constraint4
 glowing leds attractive teen group5
 decent battery lifeCONS:1
 first all, phone initially advertised triband phone operating 900mhz,1800 1900
 nokia sells 2 models 3200- one normal 3220 one - 3220b (this operates 850 place 900) - t-mobile usa sells 3220b means phone wont work india many parts asia
i called customer support
 promptly changed wrong info website asked return phone dealer
 dealer refuses take phone, saying would lose 25%
 2 days told spoke t-mobile t-mobile would send 900mhz 3220 phone 5 days

 today call cust service see theres record call
 im caught battle now

the CSR tells m since cant return phone 15 days

 buy new phone t-mobile cant replace phone
 damn


wish sued t-mobile got huge compensation fortheir blunder
2
 picture caller id another thing looking for
 samsung e715 pic called id, useless, u would see pic u open flip phone
 time, u would know caller form id front lcd
 opted non-flip phone

 here, nokias pic small that, tough spot caller pic
 major flop feature
3
 speaker loud

 quality bad4
 WORST all
 center key used select, unlike left key nokias
 tough hit center key correctly
 u mostly end hitting one arrow keys
 improved practise

 still pain5
 everytime u make call phone says note:call forwarding active
 bcoz allour phones set forward calls voice mail theres answer
 phone display note user this

 annoying

 t-mobile CSR says afeature phone cant customized deactivated

Ive phone since Feb 2006 damn thing doesnt want ring
 At first I took box, wouldnt work
 But I charged started messing around started ringing
 Then week stopped ringing
 I would numerous things see wrong nothing happened
 Then couple weeks (I lucky I another phone switch back forth I still do) decided wanted ring again
 Then stopped ringing week half
 This phone rebelious ringing
 Im actually go T-Mobile store go change it
 It sucks happens I absolutely love phone except fact doesnt want ring
 Ive surprisingly never dropped phone doesnt want ring
 Oh well, gonna go change it
 

Advantages-loud, Video recorder, Nice games, stencil so, draw make back picture phone,You change front back covers, AIM,ICQ, Yahoo
 Messenger
 Multimedia messenging
 You send picture video sound
 You add radio, comes headset,Disavantages-Too small, less inch bigger phone pictured box, No Mobile Internet (if you're prepaid customer)No mp3 ringtones, make another call T-Mobile activate T-Zones already made call activate phone, keypad mushed together
 The front back covers pain put take off
This phone decent considering price
 I bought phone Rite Aid $100
00 tax $108
00
 T-Mobile's prepaid service sucks
 You can't access web
 You can't even type URL
 There's polyphonic ringtones, use voice recorder feature, record favorite song, use ringtone
 The camera ok
 The video recorder nice
 It's actually better camera
 The keypad mushed together so, you're trying access menu, actually start camera, you're trying activate camera, get menu
 The phone takes little time get use to
 The sound quaity good
 The ringtones pretty loud
 The lights fun embarrassing public
 The memory bad
 I took two pictures I tried take another one, phone said memory full
 In order view videos send, download quicktime RealPlayer won't play them
 Anyway, If want features phone, prepaid service, I suggest Virgin Mobile
 Their phones excellent,especially Flasher
 

My husband I got one phones July 2005, I already replace mine once, currently process replacing his
 What happened? My phone started acting up, first I would try answer make call would dead air
 I would hear one ring making call basically cut off
 Then I would answer call hear nothing
 Next, phone got silly idea headset connected
 Which rarely recent time connected 3 4 weeks this
 I replaced mine 3220 still problems
 My husband's started acting way 2 weeks I replaced mine
Cheap Phone, send extra bucks get something last 6 months
 

The Nokia 3220 fun, creative phone pros cons
Pros:Changable CoversVery DurableSmallGood battery lifeCustomizableCameraSpeakerphoneCons:Primitive menus optionsBad quality cameraBad service signals(where I live least)Quiet SpeakerphoneAnnoying ringtonesVERY small memorySmall screenButtons smallOverall, fun phone small cool looking, lot problems Nokia could easily fixed someone tallked Nokia it
 I would recommend phone lower age group iat first sight it's much adult looking phone
 

This phone last longer rest
 I've dropped 100 plus times sidewalk outside work home
 Don't another cell phone
 I want basic phone speaker phone
 I don't want need adolescent features
 I already digital camera laptop desktop computer
 I don't want phone
 I don't want add charges come garbage
 I've 3220 2 1/2 years I haven't worn rubber bumpers it
 If have, maybe get rubber ball squeeze
 If hearing going try free firemens bell ringing tone offered phone
 If can't hear get hearing aid
 Or rely bright flashing lights phone flashes rings
 You turn feature off
 The 3220 like old T###X watch slogan
 It takes licking keeps ticking, (working ticking)
 If want basic phone I highly recommend Nokia 3220 
 All cell phone providers offer free contract, might keep customers happier longer
 

Me saying I "had" phone past 2 half years understatement, I practically used abused phone limits, still give me
 Battery life excellent, speakerphone loud clear, way be
 Looks fragile, highly durable sturdy, survive put back place even good drops falls
The best lights (for people keep thier phones permanently silent mode), lights really come handy, even hidden deep crevices ladies bag- highly recommend phone
But someone thinking substituting phone thier camera- phone doesnt much storing capacity, captures decent length quality videos aswell
 

I Nokia 3220 phone one year 3 months
 It still works perfectly
 Yes bumpers fallen off, supposedly replace them
 I dont care enough go get new ones
 The loudspeaker option great, bumpers lights 


 appealing
 The battery still holding well, I never turn off
 I keep phone without charging 2 days
 The buttons big
 You text without looking buttons face phone
 It's kind space agey looking, I hated first, it's grown me
 You put pocket forget there
 It thick phone thinner flip phones closed
The thing bugs high fi ringers
The lights sides blink missed call text message
 The ringers ring loudly need to
 It set well far menu goes
 Lots short-cut keys
The camera takes quite good pictures, although video get used to
 It's great, isn't terrible
 Perfect teenage college kid phone
 I also think older generation would like too, tech savvy use it
 :) I seriously would recommend phone anyone
 It great phone me, it's still working perfectly time
 

I like look phone
 I like size, shape, weight phone
 I like flip phone
I like navigational/menu button
 I strongly like menu system
 Sometimes automatically takes menu I don't want leave menu
 THE CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE A ZOOM FUNCTION
 Annoyingly, whenever I send picture tmobile album, I get message sent back saying sent
 There way display time phone's main screen
 There way automatically select I want menu (on Sony Ericsson, 1 corresponded top left, 9 bottom right, etc
)
 

Pros: Long battery life, reasonable size, loud, nice speakerphoneCons: Limited memory, bluetooth, limited group control, confusing UI 

loved size
 clarity
 reception
 great
 sucked phone pretty difficult hit menu button, dead center one button shares 4 commands
Window & case scratches easily phone i've had
The thing rubbery covers lights
 come eventually adn less 1 yr old phone looks like crap
NOT ENUF MEMORY
 delete lot included features use camera feature
 

I Nokia 3220 T-Mobile I quite satisfied, switching Nokia 6590 Cingular
 I highly recommend Nokia, even last phone Cingular great too
 Also, T-Mobile best customer service carrier availiable 24 hours day, definitely advantage Cingular, much less attentive customer needs
This phone great anyone, people late teens - 20s really like phone customization
 The phone pretty cool looking LED lights too
 Also, camera video plus pretty good quality cell phone, like camera-phones never good actual digital camera
PROS:-Excellent reception-Decent Battery Life-Speakerphone (Nice Quality loud)-They include two faceplates-Small-Color Screen-Camera VIDEO
-Customizable Faceplate Inserts (They include stencil too)-Charges fairly quick-It NokiaCONS:-The faceplates seem durable (the plastic scratches easily); however, include two, even one scratched badly, another
-Could thinner is, little thick, thinner almost flip phones-Slight speaker feedback calls, affect clarity though-No Bluetooth-No MP3 ringtones (Mega-Tones), obviously big deal anyways-No MP3 Player (iTunes like Motorola ROKR)-Video lousy quality 

There call button phone (green line) like phone
 Dial number press call, two clicks call anyone recently called
 This phone also fact 1-touch dialing, hold key seconds dial number assigned it
 Or, assign voice command number simple holding key saying person's name
 Making call different phone I've seen, easier
 The camera easy use fairly clear arent expecting digital camera quality
 The phone customizable many ways including case color cutouts
 The black chrome color cover looks sleek
 Ringtones interesting watch first time, much everyday use
 If don't want flashing lights strange music rings, easily turned normal nokia tmobile chimes used
 Menu's quick
 Call quality excellent signal strength suberb
 Construction solid, even changable covers
 The grips work well good phone small
 The one ploblem select key center 4 way toggle switch
 You accidently hit one 4 way buttons trying push select
 This brings quick menus hit back try again
 I might get used awhile, far I still hit wrong button awhile
 Overall, amount features phone has, excellent phone anyone (not teens, I far from)
 I also recommend read manual playing don't miss features end returning unsatisfied
 

Frustrated another service, I snapped phone free activation T-Mobile
 It's got little lights side I wasn't aware of
 They went phone silent mode desk
 Handy
 I'm always worried "vibrate" send bouncing away
 I also didn't know new toy came camera
 Instantly addicted I add $2
99 20 images month charge new service
 Buyer beware
 This fun little gizmo
 As frustrated buyer couldn't find "send" button - read instructions
 The instruction book simple follow
 Easy understand
 Helpful making "free" tools
 Deadly telling fun tools cost money
 It's joy
 I also love able put photo open back window shell
 What wonderful idea

 

In appears attempt emulate popularity customizability 5190 past, Nokia branding 3220 hip phone youngsters
 Regardless makes feel, it's useful
 Although menu graphics somewhat disappointing, phone's operating system stable fast
 The phone small, smaller average Sony Ericcson small
 It comes mobile internet browser, supports ICQ, AIM, Y
 instant messengers, comes standard handful java games
 Aside that, vast array Java applications buy add phone
 I switched phone Sidekick I color
 I relieved carrying phone size large bar soap pocket
 I reccommend product people want visibly attractive, light phone handle basics flawlessly occaisionally things
 

This phone suprising me
 I returned Motorola V188 I bought amazon problems bad phone
Loud speaker phone
Great call clarity
Lights great ringer turned off
MP3 ringtones would nice hey phone makes calls
Battery life seems decent






not great, decent
Camera takes ok pictures video
Good solid basic phone
You time display home screen simply set so


in regards previous post
 

I won't lie, phone gets strange looks it's flashing lights flashing lights serve well
 [Ever car system loud hear cell? This phone solves problem, throw dash somewhere can't miss thing
 It looks like UFO landing
 Not I've ever seen UFO landing
]The ringtones terrible
 No way around it
 It mp3 ringtone option unbelieveble phone video camera
Speaking camera, takes it's best shots bright natural light
 Indoor shots grainy, often yellow tint
 Makes subjects look like bad case jaundice
The keypad/size common complaint I get anyone using phone
 But hands small enough I quickly mastered somewhat odd keypad size disadvantage all
The reception is

hard rate
 Much like Nokia I one [and several others I've seen] phone randomly drops signal takes minute get back
 I think may alot Nokia's internal attennas
 But who's say? The calls always clear though, I'll give that
Battery life isn't bad all
 On "can't shut trap" day I'll need charge end day days I go without charging it
If you're looking cheap phone start I'd recommend one [more girl though, I yet meet guy likes phone
 It's small use
] - I wouldn't want pay "full retail" price though
 $49
99 plenty, thanks
 

I bought phone along RAZR, Samsung e635, Nokia 3220
 This one basic, it's still solid phone
Pros:Great Reception: I usually get 4 bars
 Way better old Motorola V60i
Good Clarity Volume: I get good volume, haven't yet dropped call
 The speakerphone adequate, I wouldn't recommend using street
 It would way quiet
 But nice use home hand won't get tired long conversation
Keypad: A lot users complain select button
 It little annoying, I haven't much problem
 About nine ten times I hit right
Size: This phone pretty small, easy hold
Price Value: The amount features get price (I get 100 dollars back rebate, meaning pay get service?) amazing
Accessories: You get two different patterns slip covers (I got red Hawaiian cover blue striped one), two hard plastic covers, stencil making paper slip covers
 You also get headset, works pretty well
Cons:Menu: The menu pretty crude primitive, probably resolution screen
 Also, get speakerphone call, press menu scroll order get it
Camera: The camera worst three phones
 Nothing low light
 You must bright conditions, even picture little reddish
 Not big deal, price amazing, I didn't get phone features
Ringtones: Selection pretty limitied compared phones
 Also, recorded ringtones weak, recording wasn't great quality
Overall, excellent value basic phone
 The camera pretty weak, I think basic phone
 More features phones price range
 

I bought phone tmobile service amazon couple weeks ago
 I wanted simple, compact phone easy use interface nokia phone almost exactly fits description
 I bit unhappy graphical interface (sony ericsson phones prettier) gui still good, especially compared Motorola
 Few complains: small center button, display show alarm time, unlock screen lingers second long keys unlocked, etc


 complaints minor
 I wish cellphone makers learn design intuitive easy interfaces (this would great open source project, similar kde:-)
 Overall, phone good making calls I care about
 

I taken picture magazine front page using 3220 I asked friend Motrola Razr 3 take picture magazine angle
 I compared pictures, Nokia 3220 picture clear colors present magazine photo, however Razr 3, colors changed bluish
 I asked one friend take picture magazine angle
 He also motorola phone (I sure model)
 That image also good compare 3220
 Hats Nokia 

im cell phone lover
 ihave owned best last cell phones market
 time ago looking camera built cell phone obviously considering motorola v300, v400, c350, panasonic gdu 88, saving cos little budget, trying find best best kept looking found awesome phone
 course wasnt looking digital camera, looking cell phone B
I camera, otherwise id recommend sonny ericsson k700i
anyways love one, takes video, pics jpg format, voice recorder, games, etc


so id like list pros conspros: plenty memory (5g) memory divided 3 different memoriesnumbers, gallery gamesyou erase predetermined phone settingscamera night vision, frame, short clips, voice recordings
you set voice records ringtones
great awesome battery life
ring tone loud enough
strong vibrating featurex press shellsloud speakervoice tagsxpress fun shell, speciall unique feature, u write messages air, incredibly feature, used long distance messaging, look ppl ;)
etc





great thing
cons:reduced gallery memory, u use camera feature without recorder clips, erase predetermined ringtones, screen savers, wallpapers etc,you save 50 pics, otherwise memory savings reduces
navigation clip little confusing hard get use to, u get controll it
a little bit slow compared k700i motorola e380 v300 etc
short life shells, made low quality plastic break easily compared nokias x-press
 onshort clips, 15 secs eachso great cellphone, really, wouldnt recommend best BI camera phone, one bestgo 

I T-Mobile 3 years first Nokia phone
 I got bc nice mail rebate
 I wanted camera/flip phone, expensive me
 I never liked Nokia 3220 bc looks
 The sales person talked good it, I decided get it
 The major problem phone, besides looks, it's silent mode, still makes loud beep get text/voice message
 That kinda annoying college student you're class
 The menu complicated buttons crazy work with
 Also, it's kinda small easy drop, decide get one, might want get case well protect it's dropped
 The speaker phone horrible
 I barely hear person phone conversation feature
 

I usually love Nokia phones phone piece crap
 I would prefer get Motorola phone phone
 I phone month
 Within month I've important calls dropped, side panels lights fallen off, reception awful
 I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GET THIS PHONE
 WARNING: STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PHONE
 

This phone 2 good features, slightly better reception slightly better impact resistance
 Aprt that, everything elase sucks



BIG TIME

I Techie I found phone annoying use


The Data software (PC Suite) piece hit, milder word it



please favor buy something else



Nokia sucks User Interface


they better reception, days networks strong enough, especially dont live remote area find happier another phone
I want give 0 stars option available 

My daughter likes phone ringer quit first two phones
 Here's hoping third one works
 Tmobile great returns though
 

someone take Lorene Addison cell phone away, decided act age shoe size





she compensate something listening cry baby story
 cell phone service rest family, plus ninety yet percent friends, one problems, think mostly user error part:) 

My parents live country phones get little reception
 This phone got great reception there
 The ringtones loud too, I like I want know phone ringing
 The lights phone add little touch personality
 

I think everything phone great
 I read reviews I bought phone
 All prombles said don't seem bad me
 The lights great different patterns ring tone virbate different
 You can't download HiFi ringers But The Meaga Tones good
 I like make faceplates
 You take picture want make cover phone
 I like record phone calls too
 I play around time
 Everything phone great
 I've always flip phone reason better
 This phone changed that
 It's worth every penny I paid it
 

This phone nice phone, camera nice, games ok, I delete themes pre programmed phone games I knew I never would use I problem memory, I dropped working still works fineI like use aol yahoo messanger right text messages I wish thru msn well can't everythingThe things I don't like scratches easy 

My first T-Mobile phone diminutive Nokia 8290, I loved dearly I still use back-up cell phone
 That phone harsh duty pocket, Houston, sorts (hot wet) conditions still I need do, namely send receive voice text messages
 I simply don't like flip phones
 I'm outside sales rep I use phone sparingly road times it's difficult avoid, thus I dropped 8290 3220 shirt pocket, plug ear-bud, put auto-answer voila
 No need take hands wheel say hello
I'm car maybe 20+ times day belt clip simply inconvenient; cell phones get caught seatbelt ends falling ground, getting lost, etc
 The 8290 thankfully 3220 slip unobtrusively pocket
 No, I didn't attract attention I didn't various electrical devices clipped hip - I didn't need attention
 I could hear feel 8290 ring pocket never missed call lost phone four years
Then suddenly choices T-Mobile Nokia replace it
 Years passed
 Now I 3220
 HOORAY
 I love phone
 One reviewer said wouldn't attract business people? Hello? I think dark blue/black body face offers unusually attractive alternative ho-hum me-too flip phones there
 And flashing lights shut that's problem
 Besides, I agree another reviewer, "Why kids fun?" The rubber panels sides make great grips holding onto phone, even rain storm
 Batter life very, good sound excellent
 It also fits unobtrusively pocket alerts even nicer tones vibrations call coming in
The keypad fine wife I send fair amount SMS
 Bluetooth simply requirement
 The camera fun I don't really much time games (I'll eat words next time I accompany wife shopping) I apologize selling features short review
 I used Voice Recorder feature times & getting like lot
 There many features appreciated phone & you're past Nokia user you'll find interface even easier user friendly
For it's simply size performance (no giggles please)
 I like speakerphone option talking noisy environment
 It isn't powerful enough set seat beside rather hold bit away ear
 Ring tones adequate pleasant subdued like
 I love detail screen shows battery power reception
 It good readability
Again, 3220 used 95% business I'm pushing 60 years earth - yuppers, I'm old fart
 I hope plastic faceplate stands abrasion/wear better 8290 needed replacement four times four years (currently getting hard find)
Regarding 3220, thanks Nokia thanks T-Mobile
 It's small, gorgeous, fun functional phone
P
S
 I like plastic on-off switch top vs
 older rubber ones
 This works great
 

This far best phone I ever had
 Everything fun unique
 I love lights dance ringtones
 I love ringtones upbeat
 I love cut inserts back faceplate
 The Wave Messaging feature tons fun
 I've amused many people it
 Also get Wave Messaging case, lets play games tilting phone rather using keys control it
 Very fun
I've heard people say don't like phone "obnoxious lights" "annoying ringtones"
 Why earth would buy phone don't like things? That's phone about
 If want boring, old-fart phone, don't get one
 

Please DO NOT buy set
After days use phone thinks headset connected either get replacement set use headset
I already got 2 replacements sets TMobile
It useless
 The replacement sets show headset icon hear anybody
 

Why Nokia still producing "high end" camera phones without built-in bluetooth? Because people don't know better continue buy anyway
 Can imagine buying plasma television without remote control? This phone lacking memory UI design well
 I guess clear scrapbooking arts & craft window back cover supposed make shortcomings? Come on, Nokia
 No wonder guys losing market share Samsung
 

This third cell phone
 First time t-mobile first non flip phone
 As soon I got phone I put black cover it
 It looks lot better, still looks kiddish
 After using phone, I would prefer flip phone
 Since it's easy press buttons pocket, I lock feature on
 So every time I need make call, I press menu button star
 This gets quite annoying since easy miss menu button
 This phone nice may cut some
PRO: Good reception, durable
CON: Feminine kiddish looking phone
Navgating phone hard
The middle menu button almost impossible presscorrectly hitting another key
Phone may small some
 

1
 The keypad badly designed
 The cursor keys easy operate
 The key functions jumbled up


Often I end starting camera I want move list using "down" key
2
 The phone vibrate function, sucks
 

I got cell phone good price {$35-} I glad
 I've seen advertized much $200- T-Mobile store
Unfortunately, it's worth 35 cents
 The feature I interested speakerphone 3220 doesn't quite deliver
 The quality sound poor, lot distortion
 In fact, even feature disabled you're holding radioactive device side head,it still sometimes unclear person saying
{but again,T-Mobile reception never greatest}
The built-in camera nice thing course it's resolution bad, it's worth activating, especially given least four ways go camera mode
The key pad designed aye-aye it's time make call
 The flashing side lights blink different colors phone rings embarrassing public places
And finally scroll key worst function 3220
It almost impossible press correctly going Menu, Messages, Call Log,Camera etc
 scroll there, button aggravates punch exactly right select something misstep whole process
 I'm going keep Nokia 3220 awhile, comes handy paperweight
 Original Post Date Dec
2005 

My husband loved phone
 He Boston sports fan way
 However, decal came quicker expected
 But nice lasted
 







































































































































The size product make convenient
 The communication clear
 After while, I headache using it
 











































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































This bluetooth great exactly I wanted
 Works well, fair price delivered earlier expected perfect condition
 















































I aNokia E61 - Cellular phone digital player - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - silverand although plenty bluetooth headsets go around, I wanted way control music call functions phone pocket bag
The bottom line: product gets job done letting control phone functions music functions showing basic information LED screen
 The built-in headphones actually sound crisp strong bass notes
However, drawbacks I would point out:1) The buttons small protrusions sides remote "labeled" indentations rubber
 Therefore, memorize location 8 buttons, it's hard operate without fumbling remote
2) The LED screen good idea, font huge song names don't scroll, you're left reading first 10 characters guessing rest
3) Built-in headphones
 On plus side, sound good
 On hand, I'd like plug headphones in
 







I ordered returned this
 Callers said heard static, couldn't hear clearly, poor quality
 I couldn't hear callers, ear piece flopped around ear, really fitting
 The bronzy looks kind cheap plastic-y, looks better online person
 

I bought husband Nokia phone could get work
 We even took AT&T see could help
 The suggested calling Nokia couldn't get work, returned it
 It might bad one, I thought know



 

Not bad
 It little awkward turn off
 It takes turn off
 Also isn't comfortable previous one, alot durable one piece moves
 























































































































































For people go like charger thing have
It's easy forget charge phone ,isn't it?With product that's one less worry
 Knowing I afreshly charged battery phone I'm road next best thing AAA membership
 

If purchased Nokia mobile phone, consider purchasing power charger car
 As soon get low-battery signal phone, plug start charging
 By time reach destination, chances phone recharged
 You can't beat great price
 It's worth purchase
 

Premium (no way) Vehicle Power Charger Nokia Phones
 Clearly purchased China made charger Nokia 1100 Tracfone detailed phone specs
 Nokia customer service advised use it, wasn't compatible phone
 Paid extra 10 bucks ship 1-2 days
 Total cost $17
97
 Found later (my fault checking) Walmart/Target sell correct chargers $7
95
 Original shipment container thrown away, can't return spelled Amazon return policy
 Another lesson life, seems
 Only recourse, buy elsewhere
 

Did work Nokia 6102
 Seemed like good charger though, wasn't hassle return
 
























































What's say - either works doesn't
 This one works fine
 

Works great
 Very useful life style always go
 I always forget charge phone home I I forget take ends forgetting home
 Works great me
 

Product delivered promptly
 Product works perfect, problems
 Much cheaper ordering AT&T 

I found dismay cable, used connect Nokia3220 cell-phone PC, perform either intended functions:- The phone recharge itself
- I find impossible initiate link phone desktop PC, either Nokia PC Suite WindowsME WindowsXP, KMobileTools Gnokii Linux(The link functions WindowsXP using Nokia original cable)
Caveat emptor
 




















































































I would never tell anyone buy this
 But, I charge every day, sometimes twice day
 It's worse old battery I had

 

This must fake, otherwise I can't explain stopped working week installed cell phone
 

I gave two stars brought mom's dinosaur phone back usable state
I give stars hold charge close week, it's holding charge 3/4ths day
 












This case perfect N95, new version
 Some bad reviews refer old version
 This one great, functional, allows access every function (including camera) great ease
 By far best case N95 I've seen


 

Overall, hooks phone belt, always secured sure belt get scrathed bad
 If phone locked, need unsnap cover enter password use phone; cover hanging like something falling phone
 Though making phone look prettier, making phone look uglier pouch
 And I don't think protect phone phone drops ground
 

Very useful product, case strong, protects phone beautifys it
 A good purchase
 I recomend every one 














































































































































































































































































































































I phone sence Christmas great
 I problems phone droped like 100 times still works great
 It good wallpapers ringtones ok
 The battery life sooo good better phones seen
 It would best phone camera
 If want good phone low price get phone
 

This good phone basic features
 However, WAP browser
 Also, Verizon & Nokia lock Nokia PC Suites cannot upload ringtones using DKU-5 cable
 However, easy trick get around rename 
mid extension upload ringtone Gallery
 Other stupid money making scheme lack WAP browser, I recommend phone
 

This mobile okay, anything extraordinary
 I recently bought phone I'm satisfied it
 Not many features keep know, though
 great reception
(this phone never dropped call yet, I spend money text messages, anyway) It excellent standard phone, I think I won't phone long
 If care phone looks spend money elsewhere
 

The phone so-so, positives negatives
POSITIVES:-The phone pretty durable
 I've dropped like 20 times break million pieces I could put back together
-The speaker loud clear
-The sound clear
-The phonebook great-The calender keep age put birthday calender go forever
-It four scrolls color screen
NEGATIVES-It impossible read screen without lights on-The keypad wears looks torn ugly
-After dropping phone 4 times, front piece becomes loose
-When using call waiting someone hangs line, sound goes can't hear anyone
-The phone would cut unknown reasons
-Sometimes push number shows twice
 This difficult trying put passcodes
-You can't download graphics
-You can't put ringtones gallery option
-The wall paper wack-You download 10 ringtones
-You can't download games
-The games boring
 

I phone since October done cause problems
 It get good reception
 The phone tends overheat die
 I never hold conversation fifteen minutes without dying, good day
 The screen started acting less month I got it
 It get good reception buildings around Eastern Washington
 It worked well Louisiana Florida, nowhere else
 I can't wait get rid mine
 

want know Nokia 6015i Phone (Verizon Wireless)
Ok, buy it
 

If want basic phone good reception battery life, interested cameras MP3 capabilities (and features), phone could good choice you
The one "feature" model speakerphone, works well IMO
 And amazon
com's rebate 1-year (instead 2-year) contract, it's good deal indeed
The drawback rebate takes 4 months receive (you wait two billing cycles, amazon takes 8 weeks top process it)
 If you're patient though, it's hard find better deal this
But want phone "impress friends" may look elsewhere
 This basic piece
 

I upgraded AT&T; Nokia (2years old) Verizon Nokia 6015i
 The difference amazing
 I'm sure whether Verizon 6015i both, service clear places I service - including apartment house
 On car trip southern Maryland I excellent service rural areas
 No static breaking dropped calls
 Works well METRO tunnelsI AM VERY, VERY HAPPY

PROs:o Clear Reception excellent voice qualityo Speaker Phone works wello Voice Dialing worked first time entrieso Light weighto Contact lists easy manage useo Good display visibilityo Works well hands free deviceso Tri-modeo Good battery lifeo Good ring vibrate optionso CheapCONs:o If looking games, calendars, fancy tones, pictures, MP3, etc
, etc
 - NOT phone
o Not compact light weight clam shell phonesMy choice somewhat driven fact I already Nokia wall warts four homes spread across country cigarette chargers four cars, also spread across county - using new phone saved pocket full money - BUT, I happy quality phone phone things

 

Coming ATTWS, let tell one thing first - Verizon means quality
 Coming phone, everything I wanted cell phone- Speakerphone quality good- Phone charge stays 3 full days (I heavy users)- Good call quality even 2 bars
 I think varies phone phone
- Size well fit shirt pocketNot good things:- Phone come headset
 Many phones come that
- IR port would nice feature 

This 6015 replaces earlier Nokia phone
 It seems Nokia got entry level phone niche locked me
 This phone everything I want well
 Personally, I need wireless phone make calls organize contacts logically without slowing down
The Good:- Easy use right box
 I never read instruction manual phone
 Thoughful design


- Decent talk time size battery- Tasteful color screen- Intuitive menus
 Each contact mulitple numbers assigned good directory/tree menu
 One touch dialing handy commonly called numbers
The Bad:- Sometimes I talk much phone
Bottom line: You really cannot get better phone set features price
 

I using phone year
 Like typical nokia, phone basics right
Good:1
 Good sound quality, great battery life (at least 2
5 hours talk time me), excellent reception2
 Has decent quality speakerphone3
 The keypad nice responds well fingers4
 VERY sturdy, I dropped several times, problemBad:1
 ** THE NUMBER OF CONTACTS IS ONLY 250, NOT 500
 Now becomes problem sometimes, although store lot numbers name
2
 Sometimes (once 100 calls) phone turns making call, never call3
 Has antenna thing I hate, well
All all, great phone people use phone phone, fancy gadget
 

A basic phone easy use, great reception screen easy read
I cells cameras, blue tooth, modems, computer connections, unlocked, modified firmware, etc; I don't care--all I want easy-to-use good reception
 If want cool latest clamshell-of-the-week, need every feature sun, get different phone
 As me, cell phone tool define I am
Nokias known excellent reception (this phone standard interior antenna, well additional built-in extendable antenna need extra reception/transmission), phone disappoint regard
 What good cell phone poor reception drops calls?For basic cell phone, can't much better this, especially price
 

I owned several nokia phones, though don't get much attention country, I found far reliable phones buy
 Seriously, drop motorola LG, you're probably going small heart attack; Nokias, it's like meant dropped (don't go trying home)
 All I'm saying they're super-solid, take beating, don't say whimper, super-long battery life well
Well, phone hold Nokia standard durability strong reception
 However, I disappointed buttons, size, battery life
The buttons fine, they're easy hit


 however I've ongoing problem sometimes I press button (any button), tend double-click reason
 frustrating typing series numbers paying bills phone whatnot--and also it's annoying someone calls me, I hit answer, simultaneously answers, puts call waiting
 This doesn't happen ALL time, I get used pressing buttons JUST RIGHT pretty much doesn't happen all
 Granted, "budget" phone, none previous Nokias issue
Second, size
 Why thick? There like 1/4" empty space inside phone, lot dust tends accumulate window
 How get there? I don't know, less dust getting in, probably would less mis-firing buttons
My last complaint battery life; definitely disappointment Nokia
 My first one ugly old 3650 (with ATT Wireless, yuck), MAN could hold charge
 I didn't recharge week, even I talked constantly, it'd still go 3 4 days
 WOW
 After I 3100, perfectly tiny indestructible, needed charged 2/3 time 3650
 And 6015 saddens I NEED charge every night, I run risk knowing make next evening
 If I don't talk all, go 4 days charge
 But phone don't talk all?I know don't sell phone anymore, I get $
02 there
 I currently bit frustrated Verizon currently offers NO Nokia phones, I can't trade move I wanted to
 Because real value using Nokia others (if put candy bar shape): Timex watches cell phones
 

The Nokia 6015i great base model cell phone easy use/program great reception well
Besides basic dependable, model phone perks
 A good speakerphone option always comes handy driving don't want phone ear
If looking basic phone Nokia option, means please obtain one
 

I love phone, it'svery useful nice
 The battery lasts forever (practically
) least good 175 hours (without using much)Things beware of:* The cover isn't sturdy, btreaks really easily* Very limited functions, use want bare minimum
 

The buttons wear easily punch number keypad, either work all





or sends number once
 I sent mine Verizon back warranty, new phone thing
 Very frustrating
 

































































































































































































































































































































This product great value
 It well made fits extremely well
 If looking case Nokia 6102i don't miss one
 I seriously doubt find better buy
 

Ordered case received time
 The case fits phone perfectly good quality product
 I would recommend case anyone Nokia 6102i
 

This case offers good protection cell
 My complaint opened, cover slips downwards tends cover ear phone little
 (A minor annoyance
 Never found cell cover perfect yet
) Other good protection reasonably priced



 

I looked Nokia OEM cover
 Cheaply made, worth it
 I also looked "stingray" weak looking wheel case antenna loop protects fastener comes loose reason
Quality unit's stitching top notch
 If belt clip release takes much effort open, email Cellet send replacement clip me
 BTW, Amazon also sells replacement buttons clips model
 Needs antenna loop protect fastener coming loose letting unit drop but


nothing perfect
 If you're crowd might bump someone, stick cell phone pocket avoid risk loss
Overall, probably best case money
 

This high quality case reasonable price
 I recommendedthis Nokia phone owners
 

The Cellet Elite Lambskin Case provides adequate protection phone looks nice boot
 Price reasonable level quality
 

This great case Nokia cell
 Inexpensive, cheaply made
 

Don't waste money this
 I don't abuse cell phone, cover started rip seams within week putting phone I completely disappointed
 You get pay for


 

Although third delivery yielded good product, it's unfortunate took three deliveries
 The first defective snap, attached two parts
 The second delivery suppose replacement, wrong Cellet model, plastic/rubberized instead leather
 The third delivery fine, product right, nice
 But hassel one needs
 

I ordered item friend
 I must say quality high end price sold at
 The design up-to-date
 The features user friendly give phone whole new look
 The removable clip makes convenient versatile
 This must have
 The time receive remarkable, I ordered 18th received 20th

You guys great




 




































































































































To clear, YES I iPhone


 Am using type N95 charges watching (entire) Rally Restore Sanity C-Span


 What's say? The iPhone cannot watch it?? Oh, Flash isn't supported? Well forevermore beef Apple notion superiority-by-bullying


I use Skyfire browser (admittedly, YouTube started saying "not supported, upgrade" I got annoyed, I YouTube app I don't need watch annotations HD stuff iPhone never supports (along low-view stuff; see, worth effort convert doesn't rack $$, UNLIKE N95 let's watch EVERY video
)


So yeah, I use Skyfire liking/faving/modifying subs WATCHING FLASH even going National Geographic bazillion sites flash friendly
 NO, every high end flash site works; can't play flash 10 games


 But FB ones breeze according Castle Aging niece


 Dunno odd farm things I avoid FB general


The camera makes iPhone users SO jealous


 I love I gorgeous, MADE IN FINLAND (kiitos


) plum shelled delight--which btw, GET AN INVISIBLE SHIELD FOR


 It protect AND bring subtle sparkle plum thing (the iPhone ones good, too, even phone awful)


Calls: crystal clear
Signal: solid--picks verizon Samsung crapple iPhone fail


FM RADIO ah man I would DIE I send repair



 It sounds beautiful-even brick concrete dead zones--and apart odd requirement jack (I took dead headset stuck earbud jack together, connecting wires, paper-taped cute little adapter smaller "Ant" (blue ant) Bluetooth adapter


The WIFI IS FANTASTIC
 Up iPhone again: THIRTY TIMES FASTER ON AVERAGE signal options, pshaw
 I data plans got rid I pay $40 taxes get unlimited talk&text; Uni Infinito ($50 I cared data, Seattle totally useless free wifi spots everywhere except I shouldn't browsing anyway
)One thing I say anyone thinking buying now


 In late 2010 even 2011


 GET GEBUIBE NOKIA CHARGERS NOW
 My first died 2 solid years travelling--wrapped tight ball ad shoved luggage day out


 Bought either fake (said Nokia came China--my Nokia one Finland--and didn't stay attached, fell needed weird specific position)


 Got last minute desperate brand went whole month


 STICK WITH NOKIA SEALED PACKAGES


 You save $$ won't necessarily around forever Nokia happens change charging methods I hope not


 The tiny travel one best btw


 I 3 legit kinds rocked
An extra battery isn't bad idea, though I still battery one take whole 30 hours talk, text, radio 3-5 hours tops video via wifi


 Or camera use


The camera wonderful


 Use landscape behind glass take tourist shots, macro flash OFF intense details, auto flash most


 Night (no flash) works well super still still HD Canon, though I prefer powershot A-series cams far definitely like sanyo/samsung/(eep)Kodak(haha)/most small cams


 Video ispretty good well lit places, awesome dark (though motion still awesome--my cat attacking toys wrestling, pouncing, etc really clear, fireworks look AWESOME it--the contrast speed great night video exception


 Any light-against-dark actually work stationary)
The swapping cards essential me
 I download podcast like Diane Rhem every day Savage Lovecast, Wiretap fromCBC, Says You (favorite show
)


 And shutterbugging day quickly wipes card careful, I 3 4GB cards case along adapter uploading

,I also love I auto-upload facebook Youtube via emails specific accounts (check sites details)


 I get friends' FB updates ppl's tweets


 The youtube app shows decent chunk subscriptions (I tweak site show different ones)


 So all, fantastic phone
 The stereo speakers internal audio(for listening headsets) really top notch, I tested even transmits woodwind instruments quite well
That I say
 I got luckily late 2007 for$320 3 year extended warranty (was $279 I added 2 extra years)


 It seriously, apart P-7811Fx computer I got '08, one great gadget keeps happy purchase 24/7 (better comp far "other phone options" "other laptops" compare)--really compare FINLAND-made--which lot anymore--Nokia smartphones

)Enjoy little luxury


 The versions may even cheaper; I like int'l better gold one looks-wise, really gorgeous


 I like KEYS i-gadget touch screens obnoxious


The one perk 8GB btw ovi store full access--this one glitches it


 Then again, I get third party always-free software
 Symbian seriously smooth fantastic; Google Nexus phones ONLY phones--what 1GB processors

--I would pick "over/before" N95 right now, duh brand new (windows' CURRENT edition third pick--apple needs step hardware already

 Trend doesn't equal quality

 There few--still FEW--Windows 2010--never ever old OSs
--that good


 This nexuses 2 me

, I iPhone free


 I don't make calls unless I can't use N95 callto workplace contracted AT&T; much $$ prepaid lick better

 Their perk seeing every call I make, hence OWN SEPARATE phone
)Hope helps someone


 If phone old you, see Nokia smartphones Finland-made get Nexus (two


 May three read this)
 Said certified nerd-geek computer expert (by force, simply choice; family's business IT engineering centered volunteer kid early 90s grew junior high programming classes FORTRAN leading web design hardware savvy age 14)
 

Excelent gadget
 I've playing phone 6 months now
 I recently add Garmin software I've using GPS week
 The results great
 I navigate place it
 I'm sure Garmin Nuvi reception one, N95 works fine
The camera works great sunny days close range, low light good digital camera (still didn't see phone better camera, maybe latest Sony 5mp I think lens Carl Zeiss one)
I also bought Sandisk 8GB Micro SD works perfect it
I used reproduce 
avi 
mpeg videos cable TV works perfect (the downsize feature absence remote)
You retrieve emails minute (Gmail - Yahoo Hotmail) also chat (messenger)
Has also VOIP capability
Some Pros:- Many programs add- Better camera phones
- Integrated free GPS- Symbiam OS- Flash- Great video sunny days interiors regular light- 3G- Expandable memory- Speakers volume fidelity (compare phone I've tried)Why perfect:- Pictures low light- Absence touch screen (could better keyboard this)- Use Interface (compared iphone one)- Battery (If use playing video doesn't last one day long)- Absence tripod adaptor- Is slim phones (but bad)- Small screen (compared iphone)- Wi-Fi range (compared iphone one- Headphones volume (don't know protection low) 

A super fine cell phone, Nokia offer classes use it
 Too complex ordinary user


 But want carry camera, I-pod cell phone bag, device perfect
 Great camera, great mp3 great cellphone (all one)
 

one best phone find stock now
 I use camera, music player course phone
 I recommend phone everybody
 

I love phone
 The features great I received package Tiger Direct excellent condition
 The battery life dies using GPS lot
 Make sure get screen protector phone
 It took day manual come terms phone inseparable
 

Excelent

, lots cool features
 It would even better spare battery added set
 

This good phone documentation horrible
 It even list extra items come phone use them
 I sure dozens hundreds things could phone I learn poor instruction booklet
It takes extremly long time shutte camera snap push hold button
 It seems like 5 seconds

This excellent phone
 I enjoy high-quality camera together phone
 I went Europe month last year, although I didn't international calling N95, I used phone camera took high-quality photos, transferred via Bluetooth laptop
 I highly recommend phone/camera
 

This best phone I ever had
 I use use windows mobile phones, Symbian better
 

I bought phone husband 2 months ago LOVES it
 Its 100X better iphone many, more, features
 It beats Smartphone there
The ONLY downside battery dies extremely quickly, always get car charger that
 And, one small downside walls sides keypad

they high make texting wee bit difficult
I would totally recommend phone I think worth $600+ paid it
 

First The N95 excellent Phone

The antenna Great
 Signal strength excellent (the best I seen)Battery life ok, power users may need spare BL-5F (which easily carried around wallet)
Other great features v21 firmware include:0) The 5MP camera provides excellent pictures vis-a-vis phone cameras
 Wont embarrassed share pics colleagues, may never know taken phone cam :D
1) Native youtube support using web browser2) GPS / Maps applications like Google maps, Nokia sport tracker (which tracks speed/ altitude/ location real time bicycling, map dumped Google Earth)3) The stereo speakers excellent great clarity nice volume
4) The screen set bright
5) 8GB microsd card used :D6) Great bluetooth support
 almost protocols possible7) Good reading e-mails etc
 supports push IMAP mails8) Can used wireless bluetooth webcam :-)9) Compatible almost wired headphones / ear plugs10) NGAGE games nice engaging :D11) Can connected TV playback video / slide show12) Can used radio tuner :)13) Can change orientation landscape portrait etc rotateme application sliding opposite direction14) T9 input fast
 especially driving / using one hand
15) Light weight compact package16) The 5MPixel lens protected shutterThe bads1) WiFi ok
 It incompatible Cisco Access Points :((2) The user interface eye-candy type reasonable learning curve
3) Wired headset picks lot noise4) Many applications power hungry like GPS, Camera, Video, Youtube vide, streaming video, Battery life marginal heavy use features
4) The TV resolution low
 Things appear slightly pixelated 

Some pros, cons advicesPros:- Good sound quality voice calls media player- Good picture video quality (but dark places night)- Built VoIP software took time make work brazilian service provider
 Now, it's working fine- Supports high capacity microSD memory cards (not 2 GB chips mentioned Nokia website)Cons:- If use resources media player, camera, GPS, etc, battery last longer 1 2 days- GPS takes long lock sattelites- Pictures videos low quality shot dark places (led good; flash would better pictures)Advices:- Buy car charger intend use GPS resources travels- Buy one high capacity microSD intend shot many movies- PLEASE, avoid buying DBRoth
 The package clearly opened advance DBRoth confirm open box check everything ok package
 The problem 3 cables missing package: The data cable (USB), video cable headset cable (only controller part)
 For USB cable, I solved issue buying new one Radio Shack
 The problem video cable, sold accessory
 

I try many celphones, best them, tryed phones(iphone, eten m700, treo 650, a1200, etc) 

The phone great
 There little issue, sometimes I open it, gets stucked while
 It shows nokia logo gets normal
 

What I LIKE phone:-The phone camera actually great takes beautiful pictures giant resolution, although good 5mp camera (still pretty good), video also great almost dvd quality
-The software nice, easy handle allows install many applications available symbian operating system, I've installed msn messenger, skype, youtube google maps
-The call quality great
-The gps works great included maps application even better google maps
What I DONT LIKE phone:-After week two use slider becomes loose
 press key screen wobbles


 This defect ALL n95s have, reason haven't fixed, family friends bought problem


 real pain ***
-You recharge battery every day
In conclusion: you're looking expensive phone lot features willing put loose slider problem buy it


 Although I think amount money problem shoud definitely present
 

I bought received nokia n95 couple weeks ago I'm still discovering features tough I always nokia cell phone
 What I still don't know connect wlan
 It seems I read instruction book
Anyway, great camera, gps ok, mp3 sounds perfect
 

OK saying N95 phone accurate, excelent photo video camera good lighting conditions, lots aplicattions powerfull round package
 My previous cel Nokia 5 years old still works well, I think one last long time too
 

I bought product mainly internal GPS
 At first worked, little slow worked fine
 Then couple weeks voice guide gone worse thing service costs extra (almost 150 $ 3 year license)
 I mean, I already paid almost 600$ phone, I pay use GPS voice guidance
 There also somethings I didn't like phone slides open easily inside pocket screen gets greasy oily hard clean
 I nokia phones (N70, N72, etc) one didn't really fulfilled expectations
 Although great phone lots features, I bit disappointed fact GPS completely free(again voice guide)
 I read lot bad things battery, long don't features Wi-Fi, bluetooth GPS ON, battery make day 2
 It also charges pretty fast
 

title says all
 phone equiped basically everything u put phone today
 camera, endless ways connection, navigation system, display, interface, speed operating system (Symbian s60)




 everything fantastic
I would strongly reccomend phone anyone per say doubts phone lets say sonyerricson p880i similar phone
 personally never big fan nokia phones one really amazed me



 2 thumbs up


 

I bought phone month back
 I highly satisfied phone
 Its GPS works great
 Camera camcorder mode good good light
 TV connectivity something also like
 

I got N95 3 month go I traveling U
S
 GPS worked beautifuly, phone really wonderful 

This ultimate show-off gadget, features anyone could dream of, yet fail deliver turned on
The battery lasts four hours used typical day office
 Using features besides calling, sms calendar drains battery way fast
I return phone, I work longer days 4 hours - need phone keep up
 

The phone overheated charging I return it
 Very disappointing
 

I don't understand life style people excitedly gave 5 stars row, here's one question: "how royal slaves keep demanding masters hungry?"
 The phone leave unworried low battery signal even half day
 One full day? No, making 5~6 calls want musics 10 minutes, definitely low battery warning right lunch
 Taking picture? Wifi internet? connected charger laptop
 Maybe, luck, take 1~2 pictures least get loggen internet site get warning
 Once again, never mobile phone
 This makes mobile person carry every things feed annoying master
 You organized person tragically get phone, schedule everything life 10 minutes chops
 Don't say you've never warned
 

I bought phone replace Nokia 8801, was, basically, pretty phone 
 
 
 So ok, yes, I learned lesson: Never buy phone it's pretty
 
 
 
 But anyway, I learned I needed know Nokia experience, I didn't 
 
 
 So I bought one 
 
 
 And didn't even last week
 
 
 
 Between crappy, not-very-easy-to-use features, ridiculous automated-machine voice-dialing poor battery life, I fed 2 days 
 
 
 But I made mistake leaving phone car hot day thing shut 
 
 
 Now yes, I know, cell phones meant exposed extreme temperatures I've left lesser (and better) phones car survived 
 
 
 And phone it's toy-like exterior light-weight, I felt sure could handle since didn't seem many metal parts (which would contributed overheating) 
 
 Needless say, phone costs much, I'm amazed little actually get 
 
 
 Now music player cool so, I assume, camera really folks, supposed cell phone 
 
 
 I iPod digital camera rest 
 
 
 If Nokia gonna persist making crappy phones, could least lower price
 
 
 
 As me, I officially done Nokia experience
 

I bought phone little back, use around world
 Right I Kuwait, works great
 I excellent service coverage
 I used connect WI-FI networks, take pictures send 3g networks
 I also used GPS
 It works great that
 It many uses available, I don't know I ever use all
 The thing phone could use different key pad entering information
 

Im really happy new cell phone unlock works really good thing dosnt like battery :p
It work perfect, camera amazing, cool iphone great choice (y)I recommend product 

got phone first became available us couldn't happier
here use phone for:1
 well, phone
 really great phone, great reception really good speakerphone
2
 internet:email -- installed gmail's little mobile client it, check email obsessively
traffic -- bookmarked seattle traffic sites check traffic gonews, weather, facebook (their mobile full-blown sites), random googling ("starbucks 98112")3
 soundmp3s, audible standard audio headset output
another really cool thing n95's bluetooth supports stereo sound, go, listen music wireless bluetooth headset (motorola's s9, also doubles on-the-call headset), makes works really great, especailly threadmill
i use MicroSD cards mp3s car's stereo, laptop
the stereo speakers surprizingly loud good
4
 gps: gps car, don't usually use n95's, it's great get lost someone else's car
5
 random things: else
 oh yeah
 well, usual stuff -- outlook schedule sync'ed phone, well contacts
 sound recorder great taking voice notes (i programmed one buttons quick access, although wish even easier)
6
 camera: use camera great deal, don't think it's great
 mean, it's better cell phone camera had, course, hasn't replaced actual digital camera hoped might, isn't good
i charge battery every day
 wish didn't travel, fine everyday life
i guess buttom life everything need, way actually makes sense, works, one package -- one thing carry, one thing charge
 iphone came contemplated switching, slick iphone's interface is, didn't want give gps stereo bluetooth
i happy n95
ps oh, using modem laptop (i connect thru bluetooth, look ma, wires
)pps oh, dropped many times, kinds surfaces (carpet, hardwood floor, pavement, etc;) it's corners scratches, screen still like new, works really great

wishlist i'd like see upcoming versions n95:1
 n95, slim bit
 thinner better
2
 listen radio via _bluetooth_ headset? (yes, know need wired headset antenna, willing plugged in
 still want _listen_ via BT, though)
3
 gps faster acquire signal startup? also preload maps don't gprs?4
 make battery last 3x longer?5
 simplify access voice recorder (one button push hold?) recordings -- use capture thoughts, want quick easy
6
 sometihng camera? giga-megapixels, want really good canon sd800 -- picture quality-wise, ease use-wise
7
 copying mp3s phone manually easy sync'ing ipod itunes, simplify things n95?man, n95 pretty sweet
 

Ok, here's deal: The phone, overall, best cell phone market far
 I Sony Ericcson P990i absolutly great, N95 really exceeded expectations
 The interface really fast, comes gadgets need obsesive compulsive worker never really gets office mind like me
 The camera great I put digital one I away I take pics videos phone
 The desing, OMG


 It sleek, elegant, friends co-workers turn heads around envy, I assure that
 It's operating system friendly complete, helping guiding way first use phone
 IM never fun fast always
 The screen bright large see defiant sun light who's calling
 If hesitating, please dont, go, buy phone, final word is: YOU WONT REGRET IT



 IS MONEY WELL SPENT

Yes, phone expensive you're gadget freak like me, it's money well spent
 No phone market 5 megapixel camera DVD quality video it
 Super fast web browsing available Wireless LAN Networks MMS

 The dissapointment GPS tracking use maps feature doesn't work Cingular Wireless yet
 Cingular uses TeleNav locate phone via GPS unfortunately TeleNav doesn't support Nokia N95 time
 A TeleNav representative told won't available couple months
 One drawbacks first kid block coolest phone there
 

I don't know people run battery half day
 My battery lasts 2 days

 I bought phone couple days ago far like bought
 it's expensive, sure it's also handy don't want use many gadgets instead
 I haven't explored phone fully
 The battery runs 2 days ( I prefer cell phone) WLAN strong laptop's integrated wireless receiver
 Other I realy like phone
 My review might trustworthy since I using nokia 6310i till now:)) 
 

Wow
 This best cell phone I ever had
 Much better iPhone
 I love high resolution beautiful design
 It expensive, worth it
 If you're gadget freak (like me), buy it


 You won't regret


 

Hola todos, yo soy due&ntilde;o del Nokia N95 desde hace unos 2 meses y parece un telefono muy muy completo, El GPS funciona muy bien despues de bajarse el software de actualizacion del telefono
 Solo tengo 2 peque&ntilde;as quejas del telefono la primera es que cuando filmo un video es de tan buena calidad sobre todo cuando hago un acercamiento, y la segunda que veces su cuelga cuando estoy usando aplicaciones en internet
 Pero en general le doy un 4 sobre 5
 Gracias
 

Buena camara, muy buen telefono, lo malo es que la pila dura mucho, y que puedes personalizar cada uno de los tonos para cada contacto
 

I admit I anticipating phone ever since announced 2006
 I say overall I satisfied device
 I it's faults disappoint, hand managed exceed expectations respects
 First, stability
 I owned share phones headache comes hoping next firmware fix glaring usability problems (e
g
 crashes pulling battery fix)
 Thankfully, I pleased see S60 3rd Edition better implemented I yet run major application crashes
 This surprising given complex device Nokia's recent past releasing devices initially plagued bugs (e
g
 N80 & N93)
 The OS responds pretty well opening menus applications
 It instantaneous time, quite fast significantly better phones I displeasure deal with
 There problems
 I wish phone memory
 If end browsing several complex web pages, eventually run dreaded memory low situation
 That problem, browser good rendering pages get irritated close reopen browser clear history last several pages visited taking whatever available memory exists (somewhere like 20 64 MB)
 Nokia went 128 MB since browser, multimedia functions, multitasking capabilities never much memory
 Still, still usable annoying Nokia made poor decision high end phone
 Speaking browser, I mentioned amazing
 I wish screen slightly higher 320x240 resolution Nokia previous generation phones smaller screens higher resolution
 It would simply make browsing even better wouldn't scale scroll screen much take entire page
 The screen is, however, quite large simply looks perfect
 Colors beautifully rendered picture/video viewing looks excellent it
Multimedia, expected, incredible
 Sound quality good, maybe good old Sony Ericcson K750, still good nonetheless
 Thank goodness Nokia provided 3
5 mm jack standard headphones, time
 The N95 problem replacing flash based MP3 player
 Multimedia keys work well, I sure useful since 4-way pad also provides similar functionality
 The radio works well enough manages pick lot stations area, unfortunately mostly defaults mono occasionally shifting stereo
 The camera really good
 Bright outdoor shots look, sometimes, good consumer camera
 Like every camera phone, indoor shots low light come noisy dark
 That expected
 The LED flash help provided whatever taking far away
 Make sure update firmware immediately fixes annoying shutter lag problem
 Pictures though sometimes come processed hide noise
 With 5 MP sensor, I suppose noise inevitable I hope Nokia improves processing algorithm future updates
 Overall, cannot expect N95 replace dedicated camera practice get good results
 Video recording excellent
 It NOT DVD quality clearly see lots compression artifacts computer monitor
 It however best phone probably long shot
 So much so, video recording finally becomes useful spontaneously need record event
 The camera soft good
 All necessary settings here, though stick close camera application
 It takes time set next shot, turn viewing shot took take next shot quicker
 The phone supports TV out
 I haven't time explore possibilities, appear useful showing slide shows video playback friends
 I haven't found terribly useful much else, YMMV this
I little disappointed storage provided MicroSD format
 Nokia provides 1 GB card box states phone phones supports 2 GB
 It confirmed though newly released 4 GB SanDisk microSDHC work device
 This, IMHO, acceptable amount storage device needed given multimedia possibilities phone (e
g
 MP3s, video recording)
The GPS slow lock onto satellites first turned on
 I wish software also provided better feedback going well
 However, GPS packed device pretty amazing long patient, work pretty well
 I personally don't lot use GPS therefore unit works well enough I need it
 I still getting hang it
 It not, however, replace dedicated GPS unit used daily basis
Construction unit fine
 Some complain feels cheap expensive phone, I don't see problem
 The slider functionality works well enough keyboard feels good me
 It tactile though like soft keypads may appeal you
 I wish keys little bigger, I always say every phone
 They large enough most
 Everyone I shown impressed appearance N95
 I admit I considered qwerty smartphone, I needed something fit pocket
 It amazes Nokia able fit N95's features small form factor
 There much thinner lighter phones there, none fraction features N95
I won't beat battery issue death widely reported device
 If use phone texting, e-mail, web browsing even MP3 playback, quite good
 What point getting phone though going it? If start using WiFi, bluetooth, GPS, particularly camera/video recording battery drains pretty fast
 I suppose given current technology small battery size, way around this
 Don't believe manageable though is
 If plan using maximum capablilities phone time go, I would suggest car charger possibly extra battery don't get caught dead phone
 I charge mine every night I go bed, I always habit phones
I quite pleased despite concern purchase, I feel I going hold onto long time
 It bad Nokia priced unit high individual really worth it, right N95 probably best implemented featured multimedia phone available
 

My take features:Camera - It takes two seconds load up, two seconds focus, two seconds see photos screen shot taken, hardly qualifies point-and-shoot
 Overall picture quality dependant environment photo taken
 If surrounding well-lit, photos look impressive
 But, relatively dark environment, photos look pretty awful
Media Playback - I played mp3 tunes quality pretty good
 Obviously doesn't sound good dedicated mp3 players like iPod, I think quality acceptable
 But, I noticed noise background
 This especially noticeable I listening music quiet environment
 Video playback pretty decent screen size large enough allow watch recorded tv show comfortably
Battery - I know lot people moan N95's short battery life
 But, I thought pretty decent considering features phone offers
 The first day I got phone, I listened music half hour commuting, browsed Google map get directions, check news online half hour, took twenty photo shots, talked phone half hour, I still several bars battery left
 As long don't overuse WiFi GPS, fine everyday charges
GPS - This least favorite feature phone
 It simply slow lock location
 I find using Google map (for mobile) often feature
Design - It passable, certainly look like $700 cell phone (since won't attract others, good thing?) One thing bothers front slider
 It wobbly, whenever I press button makes 'click' sound
 You get used couple days, DIY way fixing (available internet), I don't think I want open phone risk breaking $700 investment
Conclusion - I bit hesitant first price well-known drawbacks discussed above
 But you're semi - power user like wouldn't mind features average rather fantastic, regret purchase
iPhone N95? - I pondered waiting iPhone, ultimately decided 1) I don't like idea using touch screen make phone calls
 These first foremost cell phones, convenience making phone calls matters me
 2) iPhone 5mp camera
 3) I want make two year commitment AT&T; (I like month-to-month contract T-Mobile, thank you) knows much unsubsidized? Also, I don't know actually available unlocked
 4) I love Apple's simplicity elegance, I needed flexibility (of Symbian based smartphone) functionality
Alternatives? - I also considered getting Sony Ericsson's upcoming W960, I coulnd't wait long
 

I admit, Nokia client company I work for, I assure you, review written perspective, company I work for
The N95, opinion, amazing phone ever made
 iPhone? Doesn't even come close baby do
 With it's built GPS, 5MP Carl Zeiss digital camera, DVD like video, amazingly sleek look, I wouldn't use phone
I negatives though, isn't roses
 I don't like I slide media controls switches landscape doesn't switch back profile I slide back
 I also don't like doesn't work American 3G (or HSDPA)
 Over seas, course, isn't issue
Things I like:-The layout front keys vast improvement N80 N73
-The number buttons really stand let feel number mean push
-The image screen brilliant beautiful
-The quality camera BREATH TAKING
-It's light small even compared N73
-Everything else device
 

I've phone weeks I'm particularly impressed overall
The good:- Reception good I currently live;- Functions well MP3 player;- Display nice, certainly dwarfed iPhone;- You're stuck AT&T;/Cingular;- Great PC interface;- 3
5G nice (they I currently live);- Overall functional day-to-day use
The bad:- GPS almost completely worthless
 You standing still least 10 ft outside building car get lock enough satellites locate you, even then, it'll take 2-10 minutes so
 And get car start moving walking big city (i
e
, might actually need GPS), really hard time tracking you;- Battery life good 1-2 days depending use;- It's convenient size;- Camera, though 5mp, takes pretty unimpressive pictures lighting conditions;- Enormous price tag
I probably would buy phone again, mostly account GPS functionality
 That main reason I bought phone, GPS also biggest disappointment
 You're better buying cheaper phone buying separate GPS unit actually works
 

First, let say i'm gadget freak
 I've A LOT cell phones
 From motorola startac back 1995 recent N95 (1st batch Asian edition)
 I got mine overseas cos wasn't available yet time
True, symbian OS sometimes slows many applications open, u close you're using them
 Just think computer sufficient RAM

 issue phone freezes reboots, you'll find long run happens less frequently none
 Like computer phone learning use it
 My phone doesn't even anymore sometimes i'll 3-5 applications open time
I'm gonna tell features phone cos go nokia website they'll better presentation you
 But tell features packed one beautiful gadget better phone there

 specially iphone
 I'll give examples

The video quality best ever see cell phone(true DVD quality), even saw reporter news video using N95 capture news event
The mp3 player sound speakers best i've heard, clear crisp
 even compared friend's iphone, contest
Mine Asian version, yet GPS works here
 I needed update firmware get faster GPS signal capture
As pictures, 5mp you'll need unless you're pro photographer, like digital cams keep ur hand subject steady voila
 Great pics
Radio tuner works well
 I use phone download read books mobipocket would even buy thos big bulky digital readers?I even watch TV mine i'm about, via internet connection GPRS

 well that's cos slingbox media downloaded free media player onto phone
Buy bluetooth wireless keyboard work documents spreadsheets texting conversation favorite instant messenger
Often people stare amazement, i'm java local coffee shop bookstore, everyone else laptops i'm typing away keyboard looking 2"x2
4" screen
 Well guess know they're staring
 =) So much stuff, i'll leave u experience yourself
About 3G, mine came 3G useless since carrier TMOBILE doesn't work netowrk
 I can't wait US carriers start supporting VIDEO calls cos phone PERFECT that
 Oh here's tip decide get phone

 you're using 3G change you're network mode settings GSM instead dual longer battery life(well least that's salesman told me)
Ultimately, I personally think whenever buy phone accurately match lifestyle needs
 With N95, I think phone aims please almost everybody
 Well except apple worshipers
 =)note: To US carriers

 SUPPORT VIDEO CALLS NOW


 

Years ago, I replaced regular home phone VoIP looks like I'll replacing home VoIP phone too
 This Nokia N95 *is* VoIP phone I'm home
 AND


 I take everywhere I go
You anywhere World long WiFi connection, phone numbers active incoming outgoing VoIP calls
 I say "phone numbers" VoIP multiple international numbers ring phone
 i
e
 I Miami number, London UK number Caribbean phone number ring Nokia N95 phone
 How? You need good VoIP provider offers multiple numbers account (called DID's)
Throw phones away


 Seriously - give couple weeks first get acquainted phone
 It's different handling Blackberry


 physically operationally
 It took couple weeks get used - fact, week I took walk outside house :) It's ounces weight feels delicate - like might break drop
 But that's I used handling Blackberry much bulkier heavier
VoIP guys - Bear mind MUST install SIM chip get phone working properly - without SIM chip, phone goes "off line" mode basically impossible get anything
 i
e
 can't get VoIP working SIM chip isn't installed
Of course, there's many features like GPS, Camera, etc


 there's pretty steep learning curve it's definitely worthwhile
Give enough time you'll fall love phone
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED


 

I'm Chief Engineer major San Francisco Bay Area radio station old phone died, I went AT&T; store get replacement
 I wanted one would audio streaming, wifi played mp3's, AAC+, AAC files and, well everything
 It also HAD STANDARD headset jack I could use headset choosing
 I didn't want goofy adapters delicate plastic parts would break leave without service
 AT&T; didn't anything like this
 They also wouldn't sell unlocked phone I need traveling internationally
 I research found Nokia n95
 While expensive, I decided get one hope didn't suck
 It's possibly satisfying technology purchase I've made decade
It cleanest audio portable device I've found, including IPOD mp3 players I own
 I found features I didn't think would useful, like GPS even VOIP support
 I get real time traffic navigation google maps included GPS enabled map prgram proven useful
 The 5 megapixel Carl Zeiss lenses takes great pictures smaller videoconferencing camera useful too
 It even high quality FM radio
 The included software package installed painlessly even made simple 'flash' phone firmware latest revision,and sync PC
 No problems, frustrations surprises
 It's GSM EDGE (data) USA (AT&T; T-mobile) 3g worldwide (where available)
 Bluetooth, USB, IRDA WIFI connectivity
Nice job Nokia
 The feature set hardware beat Iphone every area except possibly user interface, I'm unhappy UI
 I'm amazed recommend now
 

I received phone fine, started normally, great
 Except I tried use functions it, went black
 That's exactly kind thing want buy phone price
 

I say spending much money phone made nervous, I say unlocked GSM phone great
 I traveling outside country provider uses CDMA, I needed way stay touch family friends case emergency
 I picked phone MOBAL sim card deal Amazon has, I pleased combo
 I also slingbox I bought phone released mobile player symbian OS
 The phone worked like champ
The good things phone, I way take photos without carry another camera I wanted walk beach
 The bad thing phone reason I gave 4 5 stars battery weak
 It lasts 2 days without need recharge
 Other that, amazing phone
 

Just impressive
 This phone provide everything need more

This worst phone I ever life
 And honest, 2 phones, I scared name "Nokia" 

It's nice phone price , Nokia done lot better phone 
 First , housing looks toy-like phones actually manufacture lot less 
 The GPS basic doesn't even come close stand alone units company makes 
 If want refined GPS info , it's going cost another $132 upgrade version phone 
 For much money , perfect almost perfect next gen
 cell phone 
 

I got phone gift xmas seeing brother law's Iphone
Although phone cost Iphone,it definetely worth it,because much Iphone
This phone bit bigger chunkier Iphone(size palm pilot,I guess)
But Symbian operating system works pretty flawlessly
The email setting piece cake internet
I AT&T; mobile service I get easyly 3G speed places(faster wifi cases)
But I go home(which middle nowhere),I still get edge speed bit faster modem conncetion
It also bluetooth,wifi built in
And also mobile service's package data holds pretty well(atleast At&T;'s case)
So browsing internet would problem all
The phone also comes built GPS receiver Nokia map Teleatlas
It give basic map directions lot blind bat,but take while
And also never beat garmin Lowrance portable GPS system
Now best part it

I researched capabilities smart phones market launched decided buy one 3G iPhone
 Unfortunately phone shuts every days even full battery
 I sent Nokia repair died 48 hrs getting back them
 I found several forums on-line people similar issues N95s, others people complain hapless service Nokia repair
 That iPhone looking really good right now
 

SOY VENDEDOR DE CELULARES EN LATINOAMERICA, Y NO PUEDO ENCONTRAR EN OTROS CELULARES, LA CAPACIDAD, LA FUNCIONALIDAD, LAS CARACTERISTICAS QUE EL NOKIA N95 OFRECE
 SU PANTALLA ES MUY BUENA, AUN MEJOR SU CAMARA
 ME HUBIERA GUSTADO QUE SEA TOUCHSCREEN
 NO LE ENCUENTRO NADA MALO
 LO RECOMIENDO AL 100%
 SALUDOS A LA COMUNIDAD LATINOAMERICANA
 

N95 (mainly consider price) one worst product electronic engineering I think I would ever come across
Let's first put perspective: main (basically only) task engineers design desk bring together clever way set resources already existed different devices (mobile, GPS, music video player, 5Mp camera, internet browsing capabilities, etc)
 They plainly failed
 It would take extensive report describe conspicuous problems, I concentrate one aspect: product cannot rely on, single one resources
- Do need GPS? Well, I tested cities like So Paulo, Atlanta, Washington DC, Buenos Aires, time I get signal I don't need anymore (i
e
, easier ask around directions, look map) - happened things ok, frequently failed locate satellites even crystal clear skies (The GPS feature main reason I purchased mobile - subsequently first big disappointment


)- Do want browse internet using wireless LAN? Pray wireless network hotel/bar ask password browser - far experience goes, work conditions- Do want play games? The horrible disposition "dedicated" keys make sure also press surroundings keys, halting, stopping messing game time
 No danger getting addicted resource mobile
- Do want watch movies? I put movies (compacted mp4 using Nokia PC Suite) "My Videos" directory watch airports
 The inbuilt media player didn't find them- Do want use camera? You better don't need quick shot - already visor opened, go many keys make work again
- Do want switch mobile without announcing everybody? If plane terrorist attack try switch on, ridiculous opening tune make sure first killed (I tried disconnect tune settings - gave up)
Speaking planes, whole thing completely useless - able switch phone, switch altogether
- Do want mobile phone? Be prepared feed (as many reviews pointed out) little baby every hours
In case none longer works (as seems usual checking internet) mobile stopped working (after 4 months buying it) screen lit completely black, showing anything
 After waiting long line people attended Nokia local authorized Technical Assistance, I leave temptation giving fixed
 I would losing money, I might feel relieved getting rid piece rubbish pocket
Nokia, congratulations, created one crappiest gadgets ever, even able sell thousands outrageous price
 Not trivial achievement
 

I high expectations phone many features Nokia renown it's usability
 But weeks persistance I frustrated, dissappointed going sell it
Until I low end Nokia phone separate ipod, camera, & GPS
 My old phone could make calls & txt battery lasted week
 The battery N95 last long - especially using WiFi
 I find I charge days
 I buy extra charger work car
I text regularly - find I've got key presses initiate text I old phone - small point slightly annoying
The GPS fustrating - it's nice get maps anywhere world - remeber download via wifi go anywhere NZ network charges high ($10/MB Vodafone


) use 3G network
 I tried getting navigate couple addresses - didn't find them
 My Garmin Nuvi much better easier use
 I couldn't see using GPS unless I lost desperate
 I downloaded sports tracker application - 3 runs I've it's never managed find satellites
 I get working I went boat
It's nice good camera pocket - I know I'm picky it's slower little Cannon IXUS I miss zoom
 I also find camera shutter often opens pocket
The MP3 player OK
 I eventually able copy selection music onto phone
 I trouble making playlists PC - work make phone
 I downloaded podcasting application (I mainly listen podcasts ipod)
 I dissappointed I couldn't download podcasts PC sync phone like I iPod
 This meant I download using wifi networks home work (which chewed battery) I manually get update - I couldn't get automatically update one two networks
I tried video calling wife didn't work - I don't know couldn't bothered trying troubleshoot
The browser OK
 I found useful access web remotely cases - painful type URLs
 I couldn't access web based exchange email - URL didn't open - explanation
 I surprised wasn't inbuilt support email exchange - could buy something I never got round that
 It sync address book contacts exchange great - however I couldn't work change volume alarms happened remind I appointment
The final straw memory problem
 If I try open contacts send text message I get error saying memor full I need close applications - even though I applications open
 This made phone unusable
 From I've read web looks like known memory problem Nokia working I'm patient enough fix spend time trying find work around (I've already upgraded firmware - didn't work average users do)
 

The product good designed think cost? If mony const, may buy one
 Its GPS good especially pre-installed software
 You pay Nokia GPS services
 Only map free
 Its VOIP good opurtinity free talk
Also visual radio, want charge you
 Be carefull

If money buy bluethooth keyboard easy typing
 If Nokia makes mouse driver surfing, It best product :) 


This product exactly I looking for, great price, since I purchased Nokia N95 cell phone
 

The battery Nokia N75 goes conversation, car charger hand case really useful, reassuring
 

The connection charger small Nokia N75 cellphone, uses new smaller Nokia round connection hole
 It's problem I've also Nokia travel charger bought authorized retail seller
 Maybe Nokia quality control issues
 In event, seller mobile charger provided reasonably prompt refund
 

What say
 It's genuine Nokia car charger
 It's high quality
 It's cheap, works
 Bought one myself
 Bought one girlfriend
 Bought another one girlfriend rabbit chewed first one
 They worked great
A friend mine bought no-name brand big box store
 Paid doesn't work well
 The no-name crapper charges slow you'd drive around day charge phone
 If using GPS feature plugged one battery still gets drained
No problems Nokia DC-4
 It charges fast, continue charge even using power hungry applications
 

This Nokia OEM car charger
 Better ANY off-brand charger
It charges Nokia phone car
For money can't go wrong
 

It's charger Nokia phones use car
 The thing I'm querying (and hence 4 stars 5) whether right voltage won't spoil phones
 From initial check, may higher


but I double check update review AND add deduct stars accordingly
 

It's original Nokia charger


 one charge 500mA


 it's fast Nokia phone
 Get one
 Other ones USB circuitry charte 500mA
 

Let recharge cellphone batteries car, since one I'm using drains lot power
 

charger great, dnt worry getting low batt signal 6131 nokia
 

I bought part Original Nokai part, I disappointed
 I doubt it's original
 When it's connected phone move, it's barely charges disconnects connects stop
Also it's hard plug charger, smooth
Don't let low price fool you
 

The order acknowledged, filled shipped promptly
 The item advertised price right
 What could I ask? 

There's much comment here


as Nokia charger it's supposed do


it charges Nokia e71
 The fit little tight requires bit force plug cigarette plug
 

Doesn't come box blister anything, came bag
 However, said, item appears brand new works perfectly
 Also appears O
E
M
 Pretty dang happy product
 For price, I live without box
 Much, much cheaper buying retail
 I bought one cars, happy
 Thanks guys
 

Excellent charger
 charges 6555 quickly (about 40 min) comparable nokiawall quick charger
 Highly recommended 

I'm fairly new ordering items on-line, I extremely pleased Nokia charger
 It arrived quickly, works great, considerably less expensive buying AT&T
 I can't tell many times I've caught 'dead phone', it's handy able plug car recharge
 I would highly recommend product
 

It exactly described course works perfectly Nokia N76
 Shipped quickly Amazon
 &iexcl;Excelent
 

This first time I owned Nokia phone, I order charger car, I hesitate I found item Amazon
 It name brand product, worked great since I received it
 Definitely must anyone uses cell phone lot needs keep battery charged times
 

The batery 6120c lasts less If I surf Internet, I car every time need 

Cheaper buying so-called authorized dealer
 I bought one dealer $25, found exact charger Amazon $9
64, "Nuff Said" 

This charger works perfectly N810
 I purchased another location charger supposed work except contact seemed intermittent
 This one charges device perfectly
 

This perfect phone charger car late model Nokia phone
 It works exactly supposed & much cheaper Amazon
 

Be careful, high output charger, battery charges quickly, also heats up
 The charger solidly built, rattles feels like survive repeated plugging unplugging
 There bright, easy see LED know plugged properly
 

Good product, would like longer cord ok, charges well, looks like made quality materials


 

The Nokia DC-4 mobile charger served well
 I using past days
 performance perfect
 

Works intended
 The drawback cord bit short, cannot power phone using gps windshield
 

bought Nokia E71 well year ago still works great


 Much cheaper buying one retail store one works good

 would defiantly recommend others

 

For money spent it, good deal
It useful car, mobile low battery
 Of course, take time charge, nevertheless, useful
 

For reason I never bought car charger Nokia E71 before, I replaced battery, holding charge long I phone synced car bluetooth running juice fast
 So I got cord
 I already used long trip coiled cord allows use 12 v outlet cigar lighter one rear center counsel without problem
 fits nice snug socket fall out
 It makes wonder I didn't sooner
 

I'd seen car chargers Nokia phones several convenience stores always made off-brand company, "Captain Billy's Whiz-Bang Charger"
 This made Nokia I knew ahead time would work, less expensive I'd seen stores
 I received mail one day ordering used regularly since
If need car charger Nokia phone, I'd recommend one
 

Awsome job


 Was happy speed whole transition
 Will definitly business future
 Thanks making everything easy
 

I'm really glad I purchased "authentic" Nokia Mobile Charger
 This item works great
 In past I've purchased mobile chargers Cingular & AT&T
 Neither speed charger has
 I highly recommend getting genuine Nokia brand phone
 

Although charger Nokia label, I expcected better quality wonder knockoff
 The charger tight fit car's charger port; tight I concerned damaging charger port
 I attempted squeeze two spring blades little closer fit tight, one blades cracked
 Now, however, charger fits much easier
My next disappointment short cord, barely reaches charging port tray console
Oh, and, yes, great job charging phone
 

When I first purchased N95 I bought cheap knockoff twice price I paid Amazon one
 The knockoff would stay phone would maintain consistent charge
 Pay less get better quality product manufacturer phone
 A great deal
 Works fine N95 E71
 

This Nokia DC-4 Mobile Charger fits Nokia E63
 The charging time normal rather quick (such using quick charger)
 The construction average
 If prefer using OEM charger car it
 

The item pictured ad one sent
 The phone plug engage must held manually charge E71
 12v end plugs obvious shoddy manufacture finish, cord
 No matter, though, since phone plug renders useless
 Everything conveys, "NOT NOKIA"
 Not worth trouble sending back pursuing Reiko recoup "shipping" charge
 Typical China-made junk
 Had exact plug issue Radio Shack version, also
 Difference didnt obvious cheap price/bogus shipping charge scheme
 They sell junk charge lot boot
 

The local ATT town say weary real NOKIA electronics differ damage phones battery
Unless completely counter fit, I happy
 This charger light let know powered itcharges phone I'm go
 As far I tell made NOKIA -Has stamps/stickers, materials it's made consistent stock outlet phone charger came phone
Dealer shipped charger fast packed well needed
 I would buy again
 

Got charger Nokia 6300 Dec 2007
 So far it's working well, upgrading firmware 6300 phone refuses charge, saying "Charger supported"
If caused Nokia engineering they've screwed - charger non-genuine I guess may also cause
 Buyer beware
 

The coiled cord coiled tight pull phone charging
 Otherwise works well
 

This car charger delivered "E wireless accessories" plastic bag CellularFactory quick three days ordering
 The invoice reads "NOK-6101" white imprints side black charger read "6102/5310/E71 NK6102CC"
 Although there's confirmation unit indicating it's actually DC-4 car charger, end go phone's power connector rather USB port
 The Nokia 6102, 5310, E71 cell phones listed unit use lithium-ion batteries similar C6-01, versus car charger "suitable Ni-Cd Ni-Mh batteries" recently returned another company
 Initial tests indicate it's working promised, RED charging light rather green light listed Product Details
 

The charger I received works fine one I got genuine Nokia
 It branded "EZ Vehicle Charging Solution" made China
 

Great product great price

works like champ Nokia E51

very useful I go long drives town
 I able manage carry wall/travel charger along me
 

This genuine Nokia product
 Sturdy Scandinavian design
 A green LED top indicate power
 The at&t store wanted lot charger Nokia brand
 

I needed car charger one affordable
 It works great charges phone rather quickly
 I would recommend charger anyone looking car charger
 

items works exactly described, works great nokia e61 

Excelente


 gusto mucho el adaptador Nokia DC-4 Cargador de m&oacute;vil


 antes de comprarlo verifiquen si sus nokias funcionan con este cargador, ya que otros modelos requieren el DC-6 que la entrada es diferente


 

It works
 Sturdy well built, overcharge phone (yes I hooked dmm it) fits 3 car power outlet/cigarette lighters I put in
 Not five star unique feature makes excellent


 

This great FAST charger
 It fully charged phone less hour
This great product comes handy considering battery life phone
 

Very Poor quality, lasted barely 3 weeks limited use
 Would purchase item again
 Also purchased cell phone belt carrier tore apart months normal use
 

I keep car console backup, I usually charge cell phone house
 I use once, worked fine I needed it
 I bought it, nice tight coil takes little room console
 I previously straight cable messy car
 

can't complain
 cheap worked :) outlived phone that's always plus 

This really good charger great price
 Does job issue far
 

excellent product unlike car charger I purchased recently online charger syncs well n95
 I bit apprehensive worked well me
 I utmost confidence amazon seller 

Faster charging wall outlet, original nokia item, useful road trips emergencies
 

I car built-in bluetooth, mostly I leave phone car, charger
 I've month it's worked fine
 Perfect fit socket
 Quality product
 

This genuine car charger Nokia
 It cheaper eBay knockoff top quality Nokia
 Many retailers selling $20+
 Get less $10 warranty
 Couldn't happier
 

Good seller
 Fast shipment
 This Nokia DC-4 Mobile Charger
 Item works specified
 

I owned used product year I say job well problems 

I purchased mobile charger use navigating GPS assistance E71, I must say works great, great thing 2 hour trips, since battery get drained
 

One frustrating realities cell phone purchases Car Chargers already included basic package
 I happy find Nokia Charger sale Amazon reasonable price
 The product arrived commercial packaging time exactly advertised
 

I would never take long car ride without phone charger
 This one replaces one old phone (Palm Treo 650) assures phone always good charge
 I didn't want clone , since I've bad luck past
 Yes, I know I paid bucks worth, I expensive phone (Nokia N95 8gb) I wasn't risk third party product
 I happy purchase
 

Glad I paid authentic stuff
 Fast charging
 Works great N95-3
 

Unit well made, performs well
It replaces aftermarket burned blew fuses
 This unit genuine Nokia part
 

It's simply working fine
 What expect car charger? It's robust well-made
 

I bought Amazon praying would real deal since people sell fake one online
 I think I, once, actually got right thing
 Been using past two months
 Went camping 3 days drove CA Canada car charger really necessary I keep Nokia maps going
 It's like house charger charges really fast (says it's rated 890mA, house charger)
 Couldn't happier this
 As long you're getting pictured item, good
 By way, fake one usually pretty easy tell
 If seems fake, likely fake
 Return it's suspicious
 The originals really makes difference
 After using trips, battery life seems pretty much before
 So worries there
 

Product works well cheaper (the shipping cheaper too) Nokia's website
 

This original Nokia charger excellent quality
 Even includes LED indicate ON status
 

My phone came generic car charger, I wasn't happy begin with


 And finally bit dust "after really light use" so, I bought official NOKIA product I'm back business



Save time money


 Buy NOKIA charger NOKIA phone
Steve 

Arrived retail package, appeared genuine Nokia
 This stuffed lighter receptacle excessively tight fit
 My concern would ruin receptacle, far plugs (Belkin, Sprint, Sony) still fit
 Once connected charges 6126 should
 

Excelente cargador para el auto, al ser el original de Nokia, aseguro de da&ntilde;ar mi smartphone
R&aacute;pido en la carga y elegante dise&ntilde;o
 

The phone car charger fine
 The customer service good
 Shipping slow arrived promise date made late gift
 Answering email also slow
 I would product I would NOT buy company
 

charger works perfectly
 love green indicator light it
It definitely essential thing car
 

Excellent quality
 Very useful long trips, I need GPS several hours, get back home
 

good product, prefer buying mobile charger manufacture cellphone, others may damage it
 

Have always Nokia phone user charger good reliable far, charges Nokia N8 pretty quick car
 

I 3rd party one died early death
 This one seems built better performing fine
 

I push hard go car's charger port takes longer time charge phone
 

Came genuine Nokia package
 Works C6-01
 Works flawlessly far
 Cord length perfect outlet CR-V windshield I mount phone
 Happy purchase
 And lot cheaper ordering main website ^_^ 

I don't high expectations product like this
 It charges phone fine, hasn't broken me
I needed car charger, there's way I going pay normally charge stores something like this
Like others mentioned, cheap looking plastic, tight fit, none prevents getting it
I would absolutely recommend charger
 

I bought charger Nokia BH-900 Bluetooth Headset
 It outstanding job road trips quick charging must
 

This charger working well, works Nokia 2320 go phone
 I agree reviewers doesn't seem plug easily car, fine problems me
 

I got charger, packaged plastic, written NOKIA brand name
 It chinese product, charges phone
 If want NOKIA charger, buy this
 

I shocked find charger AT&T; store $29
99 I searched around found less $5
00 free shipping
At first I skeptical original Nokia Charger price
 When arrived came without fancy packaging I concerned might damage E71 cheap knock off
 Well I tried works fantastic, original charger
 Who wants fancy packaging, I hear packaging price
Makes wonder AT&T; store rips us off
The second time I used I accidently touched plug metal part vehicle I saw sparks, power, however turned blown fuse car, damage
It still works well 3 weeks continual use
 

The charger okay
 It built sturdy I problems it
 However, doesn't seem charge phone quickly
 It takes almost double amount time home plug-in charger
 

The Nokia N82 everything one would dream cell phone
 It however one little weakness- poor battery life
 Being former Sony-Ericsson user, one thing I like Sony phone lenghty battery life
 I go 4 days without charging phone
 The N82? About 2 days normal usage- camera, music, several calls, GPS, etc
 Without charging via USB connection, it's good car charger handy emergency situations (that is, car)
The DC-4 charger basic car cigarette charger
 Plug that's it
 Juice 30 minutes get home full charger
 It green led indicator cigarette charger end letting know charging phone electricity
 Leave car hot summer sun? No problem, plastic won't come apart exposing inside wiring like cheaper version
 This Nokia factory model, I definitely recommend N82 users invest one
 Forget spare battery- cell phone digital camera
 You remove back cover switch battery, turn on, wait reception, perhaps enter phone security code



 much hassle, get cigarette charger instead
 

Very disappointed product
 It repeatedly keeps making high pitched sound constantly goes I plug phone charge it
 Great price but, annoyed high pitched buzz keeps giving off
 

In website description says product Nokia original, surprise product generic
 

This charger arrived packaged full retail package
 I expected bulk packed plastic bag
 All material marked official Nokia logos
 It seems well made excellent quality
 It coiled cord LED power indicator
 

Excellent build quality, quick charging
 This exactly kind hardware I expect Nokia
 Far better expensive gas station chargers
 The subtle green charge indicator works well enough sun night without blinding otherwise distracting driver
 

This Nokia car charger Nokia 5800 XPress Music came total sealed original packing
 No doubt Original
 Great charger, convenient price
 

Well, really said car charger cell phone ? Finding Nokia products becoming somewhat challenge days, country, unbranded ones found running equivalent US$15
00 
This Genuine one quite solid, works should, even amazing price ranged $3 $8 Amazon
 I went $3 wondered indeed would genuine unit price
 It was, works exactly should
My gripe much charger, would nice see nokia make mini USB port standard charging point rather proprietary charge port
 

I brought charges never used it, please judge make kind decision please read review make fair decision
 

It worth use it
 However, I don't like cell power traveling:) 

Waste money
 Landfill fodder - there's nothing I hate buying things go straight landfill
 We used once, broke
 Didn't drop it
 Didn't spill anything it
 It doesn't work
 A total piece garbage
 

Seems original Nokia Charger
 Cheaper websites
 Works well far
 Cord long enough front seats car
 

No complaints
 Had time issues
 Does it's meant do
 

Reliable, original retail accessory shipped promptly
Indicator light large (long) tip
 Perfect Nokia phone headset
 

nothing else say, good chargeruse nokia e71didnt single problem charger since bought 

What I say?Amazon genuine Nokia charger lot less I could buy locally
 

I never received vendor
 USPS showed delivered, I never got it
 I contacted Vendor, haven't responded
 

Though I bought item months ago, I used first time yesterday five-hour round trip
At first I trouble pushing charger VW car charging outlet, took bit shove in
 Worked like charm then, easily charging phone (Nokia 6650) within two-hour leg trip
A months ago I bought data cable phone snap-on case I thought, "what heck
" threw car charger bonus since couple bucks
 I'm glad I did
 Because I needed yesterday
 What STEAL
 

Very pleased purchase
 Original Nokia charger
 Store price CAN $37
00 (including taxes) bought online $2
36 + Shipping & handling TOTAL COST $13

 CCMACCESSORIES & AMAZON thank you




 

This perfect Smartphone
 Now I re-charge car anywhere
 

I plugged worked
 It works every time
 A great buy quality good
 

I bought charger Nokia E5
 It works quality good
 It original Nokia charger I would recommend it
 

I needed device iPhone
 Keep glove box emergencies
 It rather hard seat cigarette lighter receptacle Lincoln Town Car, lot fussing, I able get connected working
 Not best design, since it's used case emergency, it's fine
 The price right
 

This thing works exactly Nokia E71
 As reviewers pointed out, cigarette lighter plug fit rather tightly, I didn't force reviewers had
 It's it's picture


the cord nice springy, doesn't get tangled up
 The plug fits nicely phone, isn't loose anything
 

The barrel connector loose fit securely Nokia phone constantly falls out, cord absurdly short
Save money frustration, buy aftermarket charger instead
 

Works Great Nokia C3 Cell Phone
 I use everyday
 To put simply WORKS GREAT
 I would recommend highly
 

I purchased charger (Nokia branded) rather knockoff, assuming I going get superior product
 How wrong I was



I resort using charger cell phone battery literally dies car
 Otherwise, I use home charger only
This charger squeals/hisses extremely loudly (I hear radio) phone plugged it
 If I leave charging 5 minutes, I begin getting headache noise
 My girlfriend ride car I plug phone in
 Maybe I lucky one extremely loud charger, I NEVER buy Nokia branded charger again



ever
Dont waste money
 Buy el-cheapo charger quiet
 

I ordered two, one vehicle
 Like reviewers said, plug little tight fitting, I want way
 I don't want fall out
 The end fits nicely phone won't try slip out
 Would purchase I needed them
 

It works Nokia 5530
 Inexpensive, got 2, one car emergencies
 These original Nokia chargers retail box
 Not brand knock (yes, everything made China days - real McCoy)





 

Works well, price right
 Have used great deal charge phone trips; nice unit
 

Good charger
 Works well
 Very helpful use A-GPS phone (which eats battery life pretty quickly)
 


















































































































Excellent product
 Fits like glove
 Never remove use phones features
 Great price
 

This well made versatile flip phone case
 As name implies, adaptable needs
 You option complete partial coverage phone
 Fit snug secure, various clips give lot latitude carry phone
 A quality product
 














































































































































































































































I don't know status batteries new not
 I followed standard full charge full discharge procedure two weeks I'm still charge every 7 hrs like one I replacing
 I would expected better performance reconditioned battery I suspected might due price
 Don't bother paying shipping item
 











I faceplate
 Donald Duck sons favorite cartoon watch little,(he's 15 now),so brings back fun memories
 You get one, you'll love it
 


I bought case 6131 phone, using already, seems real leather it's nice know phone protected, nevertheless, seems meant nokia 6131 phones, package says case stretch, well, matter much I tried, top part leaves tiny portion screen out, also, camera blocked case phone open
 It tight fit I finally managed it
I'm giving 4 stars says, protect phone look fine, almost luxury


and nokia's hard find overpriced original accesories
 






































































































This cell phone look like kool
 


































































































































































I needed charger Nokia phone, one specified phone Nokia ACP-12U
 So I ordered, I received Nokia AC-2U charger, different specs (lower output)
 Being situation I in, I nothing lose trying out
 It seem work normally, customer always going think twice business company delivers different product one advertised purchased
 






























































































































































































The picture battery justice
 I bit concerned color bought it, anymore
 looks great isn't sky blue looks
 much darker makes nice contrast black phone probably have
 great battery too
 adds elusive virba alert nokia phone dumbly came missing
 

First, dark blue, minty turquoise shown here
 It's almost match blue transparent faceplate Verizon Nokia 3285, it's also compatible with
 (The 3285 really update 6185i CDMA version 6100 series
)This 1500 mAh vibrating battery rated 67% power Nokia's official vibrating battery, 900 mAh one
 I've comparing full charge shut-off times two, I'm actually getting 75% time comparison Nokia battery
 The vibrating alert works exactly Nokia, ringing SMS
Especially CDMA Nokia (5185, 6185, 3285), excellent choice
 The Nokia CDMA phones terrible battery hogs compared equivalent TDMA versions AT&amp;T/Cingular
 So way get &quot;I forgot charge last night need use today&quot; battery life battery like this
Size thicker 1100 mAH non-vibrating Li-poly Nokia battery comes phones now
 Exactly size older Nokia 900 mAh batteries fit cases
 

I Nokia 6160 bought battery I wanted brighten appearance little, get longer battery life, vibration feature
 I hesitant since &quot;Nokia&quot; brand battery, features I wanted great price
 I attached soon I got haven't taken since
 The battery came phone lasted 3-5 days light moderate use
 This battery (Technocel 1500 maH) lasts 7-10 days light moderate use
 I don't notice difference weight phone's original battery
 I love color
 It's exact color shown Amazon
com-online looks like pale turquoise, real life nice royal blue
 It completely transparent, like picture looks really cool
 I personally love vibration feature, I attend college-during classes movies I turn phone silent someone calls I'll know, won't ring loud
 It vibrates hard too-even it's purse, I know call coming in, whole purse starts jiggling
 I use plug charger phone came car charger made Nokia, work fine battery
 I've battery months problems
Pros - longer battery life, vibrating feature, attractive color choices, slim size
Cons - None I think of
 (well, Amazon could try get accurate color picture, lol)Overall - If want great around battery little extra style phone, get battery

 You'll never interupt another movie class good vibrations
 

Do buy battery
 I bought I hoped would life current 900 mAh ion battery


 so
 I uncharged recharged 4 days still lasted 12 hours
 I promptly sent back There many colors available battery, buying I went read reviews color
 In reviews, people stated ruined phones overheating them
 If experience isn't enough convice buy it, I hope is
 

The original battery's life time dropping fast I got one
 The vibrating feature great
 Haven't really test capacity battery level definitely dropping much slowly
 The clear blue casing doesn't look great black phone, though
 

If like bright items/accessories, you

 I bought hubby firefighter I thought would appropriate


you know bright flame color
 Well, much better picture
 It also helps locate it


with 3 kids I hard time finding things I need find
 As way it's job


what I say? It works great I haven't problems it
So like bright 


 you

 

I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND I LOVE IT
 IT NOT ONLY IS STYLISH BUT WORKS VERY WELL


 THE BEST THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR RINGING TONE AND THE VIBRATING AT THE SAME TIME
 IT ALSO IS A VERY GOOD PRICE
 TRUST ME


 WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY

 

Just like reviews found product, I loved color, disappointed performance
 I love grape color always hoped would come matching faceplate



I figured thing would work properly
 For awhile seemed alright stopped working
 It's good thing tiny light part fits cigarette lighter receptacle, otherwise one would never know getting power
 I haven't owned cord long recently thought checking fuses car see burned out
 I replaced burned-out fuse tried again
 It lasted two times blowing fuse again
 Needless say, I wasted big bucks something looked good, didn't work worth darn
 My advice go something know work, even it's looks
 Shop around, definitely
 

In previous review, below, I said great battery
 Wrong
 After three weeks use, phone began randomly shut off
 I convinced phone tried repaired
 I later found battery
 This battery subject frequent overheating reaches certain point, phone shut off
 I also told prolonged use battery ultimately damage phone
 When I think much I paid battery, I get even upset
 Essentially I paid Technocel[price]to damage phone
 I don't know anyone else problem, are


 know
 DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY
 

The vibration firm enough feel leather case wearing phone belt
 The combination vibrating alert extended life make battery ideal choice Nokia 5100 6100 series cell phones
 

Same comments another reviewer
 Hot &amp; shuts phone randomly
 Locking mechanism sturdy original battery
 I'm trying return warranty negative wire become disconnected battery (clear case)
Battery life great, near advertised numbers
 Vibrating action great (but loud)
 Looking another option




 

HEY everyone person looking great battery keep embarrising moments get battery powerful also long lasting colorful
 I didnt give 5 stars nothing trust worth $$
BIGDAWG 

I ordered product
 Use intermittently 5 weeks
 It stopped working first blowing fuse car
The return date passed I'm stuck piece useless garbage
 

I used couple times problems it
 Then finally stopped working completely
 It looks cool it's (


)
 And I could return either time expired
 

This great way charge phone go I like color too
 It unique match personality
 The problem I shock battery charging isn't made af kind gold carefull charge long
 If think might happen go somewhere like Best Buy go wireless dept
 get one that's good you
 

I like product
 It works nice look cool
 I wish way placing light travel cord charger on
 I suggest buy product
 

The 1500 mAh Lithium-Ion battery would hold charge nearly long 900 mAh nickel hydride battery came Nokia 5185i phone
 It vibrating battery I've tried, they're like, feature use me, since vibration significant enough notice phone pocket
 The display phone malfunctioned twice, requiring replacement phone, two weeks I used product
 I cannot say battery blame, I certainly suspect it
 

I bought battery like different look phone ever often
 I bought battery problems ever
 I even bought 2 different colors
 I also like fact loud noisy place use vibrating option miss call
 What could ask for? Great Buy



 

This battery much better one came Nokia 5160i
 The best part item compatibility every model 51xx, 61xx series, along 7160, 7190
 I could find black, fit actual color phone, thats price pay good product thats hard find
If need vibrating battery cheap, definatly one get
 

Great car charger goes well Bermuda Blue Nokia Faceplate

 





















































































It hard trying find case needed phone I I went Accessory One found one I need 

bought item August 08 $5
13
 I dont know sale time I go buy another one today price almost tripled
 It $17
59
 I shocked something small could tripled price
 Talk markup
 It good product I phone
 I bumped something caught phone snapped clip right off
 Talk bummed out
 Now I'm stuck cheapy I found Ebay
 

It's usually tricky find case actually fits exact model phone, I excited see one actually made Nokia 6102i
 It works great, protects phone, keeps easy get to
 I'd buy again
 

A nice little case fits phone easily
 It two minor quirks; bulky enough phone doesn't always close tight
 That seem improved time though, clip holds tight bit difficult unhook quickly
 I strong hands still trouble it
 Almost impossible one handed like old one fell apart
 All sturdy case made rubbery material, looks good, protects well
 

This prefect buy, cheap price, fits great Nokia 6103, Easy put remove, seems holding well

 

I wish could find another like cell phone case price
 I bought gift dad loves it
 Since purchsed him, 2 cell cases poorly made
 Keep good work :) 





100% 
 A wonderful phone nokia
 All S60/Java apps/games run perfectly
 Highly recommended
 

yes (


) wondering phone
 spoiled, mom's old phone doesnt' use anymore decided give me, anyways lets get review
 phone great purchasing phone video recording basically done becuase video recording good
 pixelated blocky jerky becuase low refolutoin settings 176 something, forgot was
 want phone video recording try docomo handset, becahse phones japan don't use vga video recording
 use megapixel camera
 phone also p900iV, perfect video recording resolutoin 320 240
 much greater quality phone, recording 2 megapixel images blocky jerky moves smoothly, even not
 higher quality video recording could try d901is offers 4
1 megapixel video recording
if purchasnig phone camera prepare high quaity
 think nokia phones always lacked colors
 phone 65,000 colors, taking pictures even megapixel camera images colorful would want be, hand docomo handset "the new ones" offer max 16
7 million colors, watch record live tv mobile phone, phones cant purchased used america
 camera 7610 colorful takes nice, clear, high quality images, buying phone good camera go ahead pick one
the bad thing say phone bad quality video recording low resolutoin, mean could av onto teh tv put dvd watch like that, taking mmc card hard, didnt make slot pull out, made battery bascially nails yank out, include instructions take mmc
 first time spent 4 hours trying yank inconvident turn phone, take battery yank memory card everytime want transfer images computer using memory card reader
 

Make sure get correct US international version
US version 850/1800/1900Asia/Europe 900/1800/1900 

Our aviation business uses cell phones quite bit stay touch US Canada
 One missed call right customer mean hundreds thousands dollars missed revenue commissions
 (Although, believe me, deals scale
)We chose Cingular due size merging ATT, I quite frustrated phones offered
I quickly grew disenchanted Motorola phones poor reception



and believe me, phones - carrier many people different Cingular phones getting good reception
 Problem phones didn't features I wanted
I really researched phones although Nokia 7610 available online right areas, features "Smart Phone" without bulk Blackberry
The Nokia 7610 medium-size phone Bluetooth AND USB connectivity Web, text messaging, GREAT camera, to-do lists, several clocks different time zones, voice video recorder,calendars, LOT games - although I don't often play them
 It EVERYTHING I wanted - especially great camera BEST reception Cingular I found
 To date, I haven't read single review really COMPLAINS phone
 Finally



I've discovered truly great cell phone
 Just sure buy leather case (forget awful FlexiSkin one leaves screen totally exposed) won't want drop one
 

bought 2 weeks ago ridiculous $$$
 never spent money cell phone before, im totally love it
 switched sony T610 quite phone right, never want switch back again
 camera good enough decent pictures, MP3 player external speaker nice, videos quite decent, 10 minutes video isnt lying
 put 9/10 songs included 64 mb card, word street 512mb slot :)if want see pictures:http://pbase
com/haomingchangif want one, hook upmoosecsx@gmail
com 

I bought phone Feb
'05 439 USD ebay
 It came 1 64MB rsMMC another 256 MB one
At beginning, I thought phone great, took almost 1 month choose phone among nokia's(6630 6670)
But time passed I discovered phone operative system called Symbias OS, uncovering unexpected expansion possibility phone I started downloading hundreds Symbian applications 3D games
 I able view Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF text documents, e-books, e-news downloading appropiate apps
The Fun Area biggest one phone: There hundreds 3D-non-sucky- Symbian games, java games, N-GAGE games, NES, SNES Game Boy games(after installing emulators)
Theres app called SmartMovie lets convert movies DivX(MPEG-4) format play directly phone full screen,including subs
Of course also play listen MP3,AAC,WAV many audio formats directly speaker hands-freeThe Connecticity trhu Bluetooth USB cable lets share phones virtually media(some times need change file extensions something non-commercial like 
mid 
nid, 
sis 
sij, 
jar 
jak, order phone let send file phones via BT) comparing annoying copyright protections added free Motorolas, Sony-Ericsson even Samsung'sYou also download enhancements camera: camera games, lens-deforming apps funnier faces, movie editors, MPEG recorders
 The possibilities endless
The bad part Nokia's motto leave wanting more
This phone lacks couple things I would loved have, like:-Internet access via Bluetooth connection PC(older nokia models like 6600 able this)-EDGE(a High Speed data transfer protocol)-FM Radio-Stereo playback-Push To Talk-Flash camera-Secondary VGA camera (for video calling)-WLAN Wi-Fi Internet Access(the coming soon Nokia N80 it) 

WOW, first time I saw it, I'm fall love it
It's Shape (like leaf) nice
 It's fashion shape eye catching
 Once I buy it, I see application inside quite good, I like it's camera bluetooth
 But, price quickly down
 Now, it's almost half price I bought last year
 Score 9
5 

Just got phone I like it
 It little quirky though first set up
It difficult set speed dials Nokia 3220 Nokia 6010
 You go profiles it
 On Nokia 3200 6010 hold button want set speed dial prompts automatically set up
 Not 7610
To adjust ringing tones volume, also set profiles
 If search Settings Sounds, there's nothing assume phone comes one ringing tone
 It doesn't
I got phone Chinese (I say Asian, I don't really know language is) manual, I found English manual online easy enough
In order receive MMS set phone
 I haven't yet figured get there, I'm working it
The manual give step-by-step instructions
 It tends skip one two steps figure yourself
There way set Menu button selection button
 That's frustrating
I don't listen music phone I'm ringtones I can't say anything that
 I use regular good ole' phone
It bigger I thought, definitely bigger old Nokia 3220
 The camera better
When take photo though, doesn't save Gallery like you'd think
 It saves photo Camera option
 If want set photo wallpaper, move photo Camera Gallery set there
 There option set screen saver
The buttons hard plastic
 I don't really like that
The volume handset good speaker volume awful
All I like it, even quirks
I love Nokia phones keep buying them
 

This first called "smart phone" I bought
 I cannot compare other's sice I used any, phone way cool


 The phone stands crowd (specially black red one), reception quality sound exceptional picture clarity magnificient due 1 megapixel capability
 The video also quite good
 Highly recommended
 

I updated 7610 Nokia 3650
 Some applications similar, didn't take long get use new phone
 The 7610 seems everything 3650 had, more
 For one, instead maximum 9 second video clips, I get FULL 10 minutes video
 The picture quality hell lot better to
 On side, megapixel look better VGA camera, good real digital camera
 But apart that, internet one biggest sellling points me
 Not phone support WAP, xhtml, also HTML
 You view web pages phone way view PC
 The real downside this, Cingular charges $0
03 per kb sent received
 And pages use 64kb more
 And get unlimited internet use you'd pay $25 month
 After paying much phone, one could start regret pay much use it
 Another downside phone it's reception clarity
 While 3650 decent clarity calling someone, phone lacks that
 And volume call always quite, I turn speaker phone
 Overall, I'd say thena decent phone, seems every time I show people always impressed
 

The phone works well, lacking intergration macintosh palm systems, u use one those, doesn't matter says isync page phone supported, true
 I use isync 2
1, I keep getting msg "this device supported", that, rocks 

bought phone two weeks ago using t
mobile nothing beat phone pictures,video reception
i really surprised see picture quality downloaded videos
i bought website www
iphonesus
com good phones good service
dont havea second thought even find phoen expensive ull love it
 











































After hours searching I still unable find software thing
 It includes Driver CD driver nothing far helping put ringtones phone, Mybat website offers suggestions software
 Many 3rd party software claim support Nokia 6030 phones don't, one I've found detects phone lets add remove text messages notes
 On top 3rd party software $30
 Might want consider saving $10 put towards phone know link computer
 This product really worth money
 It offers way cheaper alternative add ringtones cell phone
 

A months ago I purchased one cables use Nokia 6030
 It worked fine using MobiMB transfer programs, one day cable simply stopped working - even recognized plugged computer
 The vendor would replace 30 days old I bought another one
 This one seen computer, phone
 The vendor sent replacement one though works fine


for moment
So let's face it, cables won't win awards quality
 They clearly bootleg cables aren't way supported Nokia
 However, cable works models phones, need transfer data don't choice anyway
 The cables also inexpensive vendor's support responsive, get faulty one always get replacement
Certainly shoddy cable, cheap game town
 

I two basic Nokia 6030 - simple, straightforward, functional
 Unfortunately Nokia doesn't make data cable available model, meaning can't sync backup stored contacts, etc
 I primarily Linux user computers MyBat cable worked "out box" 'Gnokii' software Linux desktop laptop computers
I successful Windows computers: Nokia's PC Suite software would connect phone, without PC software driver provided cable
 Note Nokia _not_ support computer connectivity 6030 model
 Subsequent research suggests two sub-models 6030, experience may apply model phone
I happy vendor, 'Accessory Export'
 They helped confirm cable correct model functioning properly
 I would happy buy another time
Nokia 6030 USB Data Cable Driver CD Retail Packaged 

I could connect telephone nokia 2610 cableI downloaded software nokia site didn't workI proved several drivers I could achieve conecci&oacute;nI feel I lost money 

I received product reasonable amount time
 Unfortunately I return wasn't I expected performance wise, refund processed promptly courteously
 

There official data cable Nokia model phone
 This cable makes data transferring possible
 The cable included driver work great
 My OS Windows XP
 


































































































































This headset works pretty well
 I hear hear me, that's matters
 It stays ear pretty well, times it's fallen it's I clumsy


plus pretty cheap buy, win win thing
 

I ordered second one
 The first I used year, always worked well, even stuffing backpacks pockets etc



 I finally accidentally putting wash (though still mostly worked even then, good enough)
My second one working well too
 Occasionally rubber cover ear peace slips I put back (did happen previous one)
It's quite deal price
 

I told people I call sell item sound quality good 
 The set I got feather light it's hard keep ear - wing goes ear NOT stay firmly one position either item inexpensive it's really hard complain & seller's service exceptional 
 It meets it's purpose , although minimally make "street legal" , know I mean 
 

This headset purchased use Nokia 6030 phone, works relatively well
 I major issues it
 It little flimsy physical construction, expected given reasonable price
 







I bought three-piece set quite long time ago low price
 I put cigarette lighter charger car's glovebox forgot it
 I quite pleased pieces
 Everything worked well, easy figure use
 I didn't really appreciate good buy recently
 I traveling alone desolate area discovered cell phone battery run down
 I pulled charger glovebox, phone fully charged end trip
 Whew

ACC Stop tricked ordering battery claiming it's authentic, advertising "Authentic Nokia Hologram [Nokia Retail Packaging]"
 It arrived plain envelope without "Authentic Nokia Hologram [Nokia Retail Packaging]"
 Who knows it's good? Will work? Will last?With Amazon's help, I returned it
 ACC Stop doesn't answer phone
 The recording garbled
 It won't take message
 They didn't respond email weeks, leading believe would never respond without Amazon's intervention
Then chutzpah email me, "We would appreciate 5 Star Amazon ratings
 If reason feelwe provided less 5 Star experience please feel free give usa call @ phone number ensure yoursatisfaction
 "The phone number one didn't answer I tried call several times get refund
~Q
@#$%^&*()_+ 

I still sure battery I received new

 The battery hold charge like new battery
 It runs even I don't use phone
 

This Nokia extended life battery suppose NEW ordered Amazon BargainCells
 Well battery doesn't hold charge longer old battery cellphone 4 yrs
 The reason I ordered extended life battery I wouldnt charge cellphone every night, luck
 I wasted money time seller purcahse batteries them

)This typical Amazon experience I think seller removed site
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER

Got battery time almost bad old one
 It supposed new would charge all
 Tried calling Cell Tech numerous times
 They NEVER answered one times I tried call, I got answering machine full take message
 DO NOT TRADE WITH CELL TECH


 THEY ARE HORRIBLE








 :( 

In good faith I ordered Nokia BL-5C cellular battery
I received generic battery, thick fit phone
Very disappointed
The ad said generic would sent
 I feel mislead
 

I problem one two batteries I ordered
 When I called, replacement battery immediately sent I told I didn't return defective battery rather I told recycle it
 

This battery advertised "with Authentic Nokia Hologram" - Not
Not hologram missing, brand name all
(I haven't used yet, I can't say won't work well
) 

This new battery probably shelf years
 It might 10% better battery I disposed - won't hold charge 12 hours (without use) I use it, battery dead pretty quickly
 Although new appeared factory wrapper, I assuming purchased distributor long ago, back-log old batteries useful life long gone
 

I installed battery, charged night
 It showed fully charged phone kept losing contact shutting off
 So I put old battery back see phone bad works fine old battery wont hold charge 2 days
 So something wrong new battery
 I probably look elsewhere replacement
 

Ordered replacement batteries
 They sent correct model could fit cause 1mm extra plastic
They promptly sent replacement
 Contact via email, quick response
Recommended

I difficulty finding legit Nokia BL-5C battery Nokia X2-01 cell phone
 Much I found pictures match description; example, picture indicated certain mah rating, product description listed another
 The battery I got CCMACCESSORIES legit (same mah rating battery included phone (1020 mah), Nokia hologram, seemingly tamper-proof packaging) working well original
There number sellers offering battery - I can't speak others, since I purchase them
 I chose CCMACCESSORIES highest rating selling battery new

 I'd rather wait 3 days
 Thanks

It fits phone functions expected - else expected do?

 Either does'nt charge fully new battery claimed
Will while
 Guess I got I paid for
 

At point I'm sure it's phone problem battery problem matter long battery charges never says "full" batteries have
 

The price I paid battery Amazon far better local store
 The local stores wanted $40 $65 battery
 Highway robbery


 So far battery worked fine fraction price

It's good cell phone
 I 10 months
 I 2 specific points E630
 Samsung let take good resolution pictures, 640*480 dots, useless, try send them, 96Kb allowed send e-mail, MMS infrared moving; impossible downgrade resolution, send two packs
 My point sound
 Samsung promotes cell phone good sound I expect moving receiving easily ring tones mp3, nevertheless, cell phone let many things it, mp3 it, tones alarm ringtones, one funny ring tone (a mosquito flying) 


 it's good option look sound
 And finaly, alarm agenda it's little bit complicated
 










































































































































































































































Worked well bit juggling get installed
 Revived old phone reasonable cost
 Has lasted well
 



























I bought product one best friend
 I bought gift, really happy recommending product
 He pleased it
 





































































































































































I don't Nokia 3155 anymore, therefore don't use case anymore, I thought I would comment anyway
It fits 3155 right
 Since covers main screen keyboard, plastic material two halves, closed, makes phone quite bit thicker folded up
 It took little getting used to, end ok
The quick release belt clip works expected
 The phone snaps without drama releases soon pull press button
Working phone brand new case made little nervous
 It's tight fit fresh box required lot pressure work phone "pockets
" The 3155 notorious weak hinge (mine broke - that's I don't anymore) I thought I going damage phone
 Everything worked fine
The naked 3155 feels like slim, compact phone
 However *any* case it, definitely feels larger
 No fault case, something prepared for
 






















































































































































































































































































































































































































The charger advertised, like original, folding blades yet come such, like cheaper versions advertised less Amazon
 This deceitful advertising
 Received reply reseller mentioning issue
 

Hard find chargers one year old phones (does make sense anyone else phone companies keep using different plugs phone?), one great
 Quick delivery too
 





























































































































































































































































































This product marketed thru amazon "Nokia 6100 Cellular Phone - GSM"
 I interested product placed order
 When I got shippment, I got cellphone battery cellular phone
 I trying contact seller couldn't
Even getting order confirmation notification, I sent mail seller asking contents box
 No replies
Its bad experience
 

















































This excellent product
 I finally complete conversation excellent sound quality
 

I received Plantronics M223-N1 Mobile Headset Nokia Specific 2
5mm Plug yesterday I amazed find works exactly described
Excellent noise suppression, fits ear perfectly wearing five minutes almost forget even on
I LOVE it, might buy another one wife
Dave 

As owner whole string various models Nokia cell phones, I discovered Nokia users found out
 That is, accessory plug Nokia THREE black bands around it, NOT "standard" TWO - rendering sale non Nokia earplugs, headsets, etc, completely inoperative Nokia phones
 Looking something bit sophisticated, sound-wise, standard Nokia earplug-mike wire, I surprised, pleased - yes, tad suspicious see Plantronics set advertised less $12
 actually specified compliance Nokia (note -N1 end model number device
) The 'standard' 2
5mm plug information misleading products manufacturers claim products compliant Nokia - plug size issue - number bands 0 look realkly closely, shape plug tip
The moment arrived, I opened it, plugged cell phone, put earpiece fully expected fail
 Oh joy joys
 The headset icon phone's screen activated - indicating actually recognized accepted device
 I made call another voice mail test quality microphone mounted short boom claims "Noise canceling reduce background noises
" It both
 It also featured rubbery ear-holder adapted work either ear one-touch call answer/end button earpiece
 The microphone also supports works voice activation feature activated phone
In drawer home, I collection devices purchased Nokias past work I bother return
 I ready toss them
 On online ad device, 1) close shot plug CLEARLY showing three necessary black bands, well 2) naming specific Nokia model compliant it
 I use Nokia 6030 currently
I told people I often call car reception sound vastly improved simple inexpensive device
 I wish I found sooner
So


 Do `generic' plug-in devices work Nokia phones? Generally not
 Are truly compliant devices manufacturers available? Finally, answer long awaited YES
 Check out
 

PROS: good voice mic qualityCONS: stable small ears
 sure average/larger ears
 















































































































































































































































































































































































































































Let first start talking service
 I seen many reviews complained service often customer service carrier
 Customer service unrelated phone itself, service not


The reception phone gets incredible
 Wherever I go I always full-service reception
 My buddy placed Nokia 3620 real near 7610 (both ATT Cingular), gauge much difference phone really makes reception,and I 3 bars

This new generation smart phone vs
 another (older gen) smart phone, too, comparing CZ diamonds
Now move features
 This phone everything could want
 The to-do list calendar features in-depth useful
 Combined Nokia PCSuite cable driver Nokia website, seamlessly transfer files back forth PC/laptop phone
 I like kid candy shop feature working assigning different mp3 friends family
 Sound comes much clearer this, playing true MP3s, MP3s converted WAVs like 3620
 Only drawback Cingular recognize phone feature area, probably (as local cell phone shops said) 'not available Colorado market
' I desire pay $2
49 per ringtone anyways, problem I doubt rest inclined either
This phone also capability record 10 MINUTES video
 All I say WOW
 I ventured anywhere near length (1-2 minutes far) quality video incredible, especially considering source (a phone)
This also Bluetooth phone, things Bluetooth does
I transferred files via Bluetooth, process slow, likely due older OS receiving phone
The Symbian OS phone plain fast, lag whatsoever, runs seemlessly
 The 64MB card included phone also great, fills fast uploading mid high quality MP3s 4-5 MB per
 Would nice included card more, $199 I wishful bordering greedy
I would defientely call phone serious deal highly reccomend purchasing it
Get phone, two bills, letstalk clearer
 

After bit research reading couple reviews Nokia 7610, I decided get phone new plan
 My previous phone Samsung e715, good first 6 months screen turned washed looking
 For second phone, I wanted something could handle functions, customizable, could expand needs
 Basically, I wanted something cell phones full fledged PDA
 The Nokia 7610 perfect good build quality Nokia stands also uses Symbian 60 v7
0 operating system
 It essentially smartphone
 People looking phone realize intended people want use one reason only
 This phone comes 1
2MP camera/videocamera, Bluetooth, speakerphone, mini MMC expansion slot (with 64mb card included), one best LCD screens around
 In addition, USB cable included, download programs, mp3s, themes, ringtones send phone
 Tactile response pretty good
 Actually, I'd say little "too" good since buttons might seem give noisy "click" sound people
 But hey, least they're mushy hard press
 The speed operating system pretty good well
 I heard Nokia 6600 seiries phones lagging problems turning phone opening programs
 It seems problem fixed updated OS here
 Overall, I'd say close perfect phone I could imagine
 

I love phone, although I didnt purchase here, still great phone, picture quality absolutly great, menu everything fantastic, ringtones I get music computer great everybody else spending money pay ringtones I download music library besides phone isnt stores I one kind here, good I like stand cuz everyone else awful aggrivating flip phones 

























































































































This car charger fit Nokia 6102 (Cingular)
 We ordered two


need return both
 

This charger fit 6102
 I ordered several months ago I first got phone never got around opening return period I'm stuck it


 Also, isn't Nokia brand charger I linked phone's Amazon page said "Nokia accessories"


 

Why would put charger area Nokia 6101 phones fit phone? It frustrating order said fit phone get open doesnt actually fit
 That BIG waste money


 So Nokia 6101 even though says fits phone DO NOT GET IT really doesnt fit it


 

Contrary claims made ad copy, adapter NOT fit Nokia 6103
 



























































































































































The case bit bulky
 The main problem plastic clip swivels, easy attach belt easy releasy hurry take call
 However, provides good protection phone I wanted somthing like one since usually remove phone case, keeps phone protected case I drop it
 An average case job
 






























































































































































































































































































































































































































I originally planning buying el cheapo Bluetooth headset LG VX8100 up-sold expensive, brand name headset (this Nokia HS-26W)
The pro I think earpiece design
 The piece goes behind ear flexible pretty comfortable
 Weight wise it's really light weight
No cons


 It marketed ~5 hours talk time, plenty standby time boot
 This biggest complaint - battery life closer hour
Another problem plagues many low mid end boom-less headsets there's horrible echo caller hears voice
I used headset well week returning it
 Having charge times day handle hour two calls excessive unnecessary
 Add echo problem wasn't one good reason keep HS
 

The HS26w 3rd BT headset, phone i'm using Sony-Ericsson w600i
 I figured even w600i doesn't support Bluetooth 2
0, sooner later i'll end phone does, get headset that's already using new standard? Paid 49 USD this, I've headset week now, i'm entirely pleased
First sound quality, headset decent near phone, delivers clear normal sounding voice ends
 good
 noisy locations doesnt work well, good


 sub $50 headset didn't expect perform well first place
The range headset is


 iffy
 paring w600i, 2 meter HS26w starts get statics
 around 6 meter people end couldn't hear me
 paired Moto Razr V3 range increases bit, statics comes around 4 meters so
 So, guess pretty much phone dependent thing, mileage may vary
Next user comfort
 This headset uses unorthodox fork shaped clip/hook secure itself, part works
 fork shaped clip made soft rubber, feels comfortable secure even glasses on
 however, fork's position fixed (its screwed on, can't remove adjust it), large ears (i do), speaker end pointing far back
 ended turn volume up, creates echo


The unit somewhat heavy, one 'i didn't even know on' kind headset
 whats worse, unit's dimension bigger current gen headsets
 length width might seem ok paper, thickness kills - thickest point, HS26w almost thick wide - size pack gum, definately inconspicuous headset
 makes worse minimalist front panel design isn't bad, isn't even attempt made making sides look better - 2 pieces colored plastic screwed together
 unit thick, looks ugly feels cheap
on upside, pairing headset phones PCs pretty easy, headset doesn't seem pairing mode - need search phone pc, enter passcode thats it
so, it, HS25w 6th gen BT2
0 headset that's heavy, big, ugly worn
 i'm probably going return mine days
 

I charged battery straight envelope
 The battery charged within couple hours died 1
5 hours talk time
 It went half battery battery less 10 seconds
 I purchased new battery Eforcity, dud
 

I recentenly purchased 2 Nokia cell replacement batteries
 After receiving first one, hold charge well so, price, I ordered another
 Neither hold charge well
 Must old seconds
 

looking replacement battery old nokia CDMA phone didnt want spend much money it


bought thing I happy works advertised


 

I received yesterday, I charged full capacity then
 It hasn't gone yet, I've using lot today
 My original battery would've halfway now
 So, works really well
 I highly recommend it
 

I purchased replacement batteries Nokia BCL-2 found slightly "bigger" official Nokia products, batteries appeared work well initially, wasn't big deal
 But weeks (two) batteries began lose charge rapidly provided hours (three) talk time stand-by
Then phone signal "dead battery" cut call NOW
 I feel batteries OLD stock I sucker got stuck them
 

This obviously counterfeit knockoff
 Less two months installation, less five minutes use per week, battery hold charge even 24 hours
 

Do buy Nokia 6650, it's battery
 And even clearly states one "FOR NK-3310/3360/3390" 

I Nokia 6650 battery sent (the white Nokia BLC-2) small
 The battery phone black, larger BP-4L
The seller (CCMACCESSORIES) indicate would like return wrong battery cost
 I'm that
 It silly expect spend time, gasoline driving post office Kennesaw, postage return inexpensive item
 It may cost item worth
 Please correct display ad see I get correct battery I happy
 If not, keep money part amicably
As 7//7/2010, Amazon seller remained mute since review posted
Don Myrick 

This product came quickly works great, excellent replacement old dead battery Inexpensive
 

Fast turn around
 New battery arrived days one third price local stores
Now I travel beyond end charger cord again
 







Had major problems using headset listen music stored Nokia 6126
 When I incoming call, music gets interrupted, ringing sounds headphones
 The headset button used answer call, also microphone hands-free phone conversations
 The people I talked said could hear fine, long I pulled neck strap little
 Upon hanging up, music restarts automatically
 The complaint I would headset even volume way times music isn't loud enough -- instance, I'm walking street heavy traffic
 

The headset HS-23 OEM product really cheap compared Nokia's original HS-23 Stereo Headset, If lucky might get happy unit
 As things goes OEM bare product, documentation available, Just headset couple in-ear foams
Pros:(+) Cheap, Very cheap indeed
(+) Decent Audio quality(+) Can change FM Stations Volume control using headset buttons(+) Voice Activated dialing possible(+) Gives nokia phone FM Radio capabilityCons:(-) As cheap product, Construction so
(-) It easily get tangled up, odd looking contraption
(-) Sometimes FM station scan may happen (Could phone issue)(-) The built-in microphone good Handset's microphone
The review done using Nokia 6085 (Black) AT&T;, Your mileage may vary Nokia handsets
By far, cheapest way get FM radio Stereo headset capability Nokia compatible phones 

I purchased specifically NOKIA phones require special plug headphones
 This exactly I expected be
 It arrived quickly works great
 The complaint I have, typical ear buds, difficult keep ears walking jogging
 

Oveall good item
 Very nice sound design good
 Only problem earbuds hurt ears
 

I ordered six ear bud headsets
 I tried one person I speaking couldn't hear me
 My husband tried one; really liked it, spoke I heard buzzing line
 After week two broke completely
 

If Nokia phone must product
 The sound inbeleivable
 The FM radio great hands free works perfect
 Easy use breakaway headset case gets caught something
 The best



 

I got item like month ago since using cell phone anything else
 It fits Nokia N75
 The problem trying plug initially need spend time
 Make sure part metal latches facing towards cell phone screen, otherwise damage port
I listen mp3s radio, button switches preset radio stations, mutes music whenever got phone call, resumes soon phone conversation over
 Highly recommended anyone, wants listen music cellphone
 

sound ok


 controls mic make serve two purposes


 like hangs around neck pull one side need be


 mic picks static


 2 50 couldnt ask more


 

This product exactly says will
 When I bought it, I didn't realize also doubles hands free headset calls, I bought simply listen music MP3 player phone
 That's nice feature, I answer calls I'm listening music without taking headset off, switching blue tooth
 My one beef use "pop port" doesn't standard headphone jack, issue phone headset, headset gets 5 stars
 

The quality clearness audio one surprise using first time, I recommend widely
 

Received product Eforcity quickly
 All pieces included foam ear covers included
 I haven't used calls yet, works well listening music 6126
 Can't beat price
 

Product great
 Sound quality OK price
 I satisfied bluetooth headset got (Nokia BH200)
 much clearer bluetooth
 Only negative lines could messy
 

I'll keep short sweet given reviews here
This wonderful bargain
 It's real deal; actual Nokia brand headset
 Total cost shipping BargainCell $8
63
BC shipped promptly, well packed, came everything including ear cushions
 Didn't take long either get FM radio working
Now, entire Nokia approach


 it's shame one buy additional product get FM cell phone
 It included phone
But, haven't ever used system before, it's nuisance carry around ear buds get FM radio work
 While it's true one put device loud speaker, ear buds connected (they act antenna)
This really poor approach getting FM
 They really build device itself
 I'm going use often
 So, take consideration buying Nokia cell phone, buying get FM
 It's gimmick something you'll use time
But product, seller, Bargain Cell commended
 

I received headset two days ago
 They provide quite satisfactory sound quality listening music walk
 The function button answering phone also convenient
 Mic clear enough
 I won't bother look better headset, since I already one low price
 

I 3 different sets wired earbuds made nokia best around
 decent sound, good fit great controls cheap
 If budget wand best around I recommend these
 Best feature inline volume control, must book
 

For amount pay it, It good investment
 The sound quality great, use incoming calls person line generally problem hearing you
Only complaints would setup cords bit hassle, sometimes cannot hear call good music, earbuds quite large
Overall pretty good though
 

Can't listen radio mycell phone without thisitem
 Works great gets tangled I'm careful
 

For longest time, I thought it'd lot better way switch songs mp3 player using headset


before I found button so, I always open music player manually, really annoying
 But really, I didn't know button headset that
 Now buttons let rewind fast forward


anyway, excellent


until got ran cars


but I can't blame quality headset, since


I think anything would crushed ran 2 cars
 

The sound quality top notch, earth anyone keep things ears? They're huge don't fit little ears slightest, makes bad buy me
 I'm gonna try getting adapter regular ear phones
 Maybe big ears would great? I don't know, aren't me
 

The sound great music, I haven't used calls yet
 The thing I don't like earbuds big don't stay well
 

I've Nokia headsets year overall I've pretty pleased
I mainly use headphones listen music I jogging
 The little ear-pieces feel reasonably comfortable audio clarity pretty good
As far talking someone using headset, clarity part fairly strong
 Although sometimes person end can't hear well; doesn't happen often
The volume control side easily accessable
 Couple minor gripes: (1) large frontal button(to answer calls skip songs) easily pushed accidentally, (2) many wires easily tangle-up
Otherwise nice choice main purpose listening music Nokia phone
 

If want wired headset listening FM radio MP3 player Nokia phone, works perfectly
 

The headset sold bargaincell poor quality broke days
 Now I hear speak
 It fragile push button volume control(but it's not), shell break apart see inside
 Terribly made
 Absolutely fake product
 Don't buy anymore


 

WOW
 well, got these
 little button comes handy


 sound clear


 good


 like far 

I've owned two headsets purchasing one, despite model number one I recieved different
 It made noticably cheaper plastic, audio quality much poorer music, worst volume button longer button
 It piece plastic serves purpose filling spot volume button previously
 At times I get buzzing sound heard earpiece, I calling
 The headset looks identical pictures, reason Nokia begun constructing differently
 At least wasn't expensive
 

I think third set headphones
 The first set train somewhere Timbuktu
 The second pair didn't survive turn washing machine
 But, I'm hoping it'll third time lucky
Why I keep getting them? Because work
1) They give stereo sound calls music
2) They stay around neck using (perhaps "attractive" great driving want answer call)3) They take beating keep working
But, forewarned: They don't get extremely loud, forget listening music subway (hence four stars)
 If want that, get adaptor noise cancelling headphones
 But, plan using quiet moderately loud environments, work perfectly
 And price, don't even worry taking turn washer


 

Great price, sound nice enough volume, also enables change radio stations 6085 Really drawback mic rub shirt causing unnecessary noise, shame provided clip
 

Too much noise cause microphone rubbing clothes-cannot adjust avoid
 People end cannot hear clearly: sounds muffled, distant cuts completely
 Must hold microphone mouth people hear better-which defeats "hands-free" purpose
 I end disconnecting using phone alone
 

I bought I could listen radio phone back-up Bluetooth headset
 It works well radio, people complain loud noise microphone makes rustles shirt I use hands-free headset
 There doesn't seem way adjust microphone height prevent this
 Also, cord wires going earpieces get tangled easily
 I suppose I shouldn't complain given cost bucks
 

Just like original came phone, i
e
 great sound quality, comfortable
 

It excellent sound quality I'm listening music phone
 Its nice loud hear base everything really good
 I also use talk someone calls me
 You also answer hang calls it
 Very good value money

 

Works like supposed price reasonable
 I like kind ear bud head set personally
 Would buy one broke
 

This wonderful product especially price
 Beware issues though: The prongs used insert pop-port somewhat fragile, careful insertion removal
 I received 2 defective headsets getting one worked flawlessly
 The first mic defect volume adjustment defect
 The second prong broke rendering product somewhat useful severely compromised point I didn't want use anymore b/c would unattach calls listing music There interference phone call, infrequent could concern
 Other review state earbuds fit well, I haven't experienced problem
Positive aspects are: improves safety activities driving, cycling even used running ( I done although phone bit heavy normal MP3 player)
 Sound voice quality exceptional
 End/answer/adjust volume/change song voice dial phone remotely located
 The volume level (high) satisfactory well
Recommendations: Buy 2 time minimize chance defect accidental breakage
 Great Product, least worth try
 

The product arrived quickly good condition
 The cords pretty tangled though foam covers provided
 Worked perfectly Nokia 6102i
 The sound good controls easy work
 

Everyone makes mistakes follow-up makes difference
 One items wrong & corrected fast original shipment
 Sign good company business with
In Him, Dr
 Carl 

Bought item 1/3 price cellphone store
 The quality sound amazed me
 

I really like headset
 The earphones actually pretty large fit inner part ear, sit outer ear fine
 I still hear things going around me
 These aren't want noise cancelling


 didn't realize COMPLETE headset
 I voice dial, adjust volume, change radio stations, etc
 little silver box
 wires thicker shoddy headset got Cingular store
 (The reason i'm replacing old headset wire bent easily base unit


thus, short
) The box hangs 10-12 inches chin sound apparently pretty good speak


no one's complained yet
 Oh


the old, flimsy headset? Cost $18
 

The cord appeared pretty messy
 But product fine
-Good quality sound
-Accept/Hang calls
-Volume control
I don't think I want more
 The connector Pop-port connector
 It's showed big product's image
 If 2
5mm jack still insist buying look image, h


 wrong you? 

This purchased friend trouble obtianing replacement headset
She quite happy product
 

This good use basic headset
 It seek button control FM songs
 If missed original headset, go this
 If use headset speaking caller, good
 

This exactly I looking I could play radio listen player phone
 It work N75 listed
 

These headset great
 Just like ones came box phone
 

The product works perfectly Nokia 6086, allowing listen phone's radio music player standby mode still receive call pushing button pendant 


 pushing call return music
 The pendant also volume control
 Cool
Although product priced 10% t-mobile's price, one I got vendor used, cords nearly impossibly tangled, delivered without little foam covers earbuds normally provided headset
 Not cool
 

First off, use pretty loose scales saying weighs 3lbs(


) make shipping costs soak low cost shown
 I haven't recieved yet, seems worth $ works 6133, wasn't listed, similar 6126/6131 were, I'll wait see
 

This headset NOT compatible Nokia E62
 The Nokia E62 2
5mm headphone jack pop port shown accessory
 

Music saved phone sounds great headphones
 My issue playback features phone; definitely good i-pods
 However, playback issues Nokia, headset
 

este hand free mi parece que es original, la verdad el material se ve muy bien, el precio es aceptable y lo recibi en el tiempo que dijeron que lo recibiria
 

It's original product it's quality best get
 Buy it
 

This great ear piece, cost low 
 I got timely manner
 

ear bud good set paid them
 many compare quality
 would buy 

I lost original headset came Nokia N73 Music mobile
 I looking option, buy new headset mp3 player
 I saw product Amazon seeing reviews, thought giving chance
 Seeing price risk buy
 I happy quality overall purchase
 A good deal
 It came around $5, shipping quick worked well
 

This produce works great Nokia 6085 Cell phone easy setup use
 

This product arrived home within days I cant beleive good sound quality is
 

These stereo headphones work well, great sound
 The deep stereo sound comes goes listening radio
 The mic far mouth choose use instead handset
 But overall, great product
 

bought earphones, I like listen radio go
 It great little gizmo, automatically switches radio get call switches back done
 easy use, however rather fragile, I bought two last year
 It part daily routine I love it, would still buy got broken
 





























































































































































































































































I'm previous owner Body Glove Cel Phone cases (a Moto V810)
I purchased item Amazon days ago 6255
 My Cel fits perfectly
 The case protects every part Cel (buttons, screens, jacks) use every option cel comfortable would without case, looks nice
My next phone body glove case too
 


































It nice compact


so much better always tangled ear bud cord I always delt with
 The winder seems pretty study shaped ear piece fits ear never want go back cheap foam-covered round ones
 The complaint, pretty major one, people I talked sometimes heard loud buzzing sound I could barely hear
 It occurred I used Jabra ear bud, I don't know earset defective compatability problem Nokia 3595 I have
 

I ordered thinking would work Nokia 3588, description states works &quot;3500&quot; series phones
 However, I got plugged in, wasn't working
 I looked packaging noticed little asterisk stating earset NOT work 3585 (and, apparently, 3588)
 So I return it
 Ah well
 I'll probably get one 2
5mm universal jack
 I'm giving three, I've used earpieces past they've tended pretty good
 








Great item
 I bought husband
 It sturdy holds cell phone tight
 I like keeps screen inside keep getting scratched
 

The clip perfect fits great
 The plastic soft touch, great quality

 It's must Nokia E71 

I clip 2 weeks now
 It excellent clip
 It holds phone well swivels pretty nicely
 The inside clip layer micro fiber protect screen phone
 The design belt clip good too
 For E71x must buy
 

I received holster clip Boxwave I'm extremely impressed clip
 It's even better I thought would looking pictures
 This clip simply AWESOME
 Boxwave great company I'm one happy customer using products
 This clip cloth type insert inside keeps screen safe without scratching
 The outside shell rubbery feel nice clip itselft works excellent
 One Great Product


 Very happy, would definitely recommend Nokia E71 E71X users
 Thank keep good work
 

I purchased clip unlocked E71 I've year, I easily take along running music well available calls
The build quality good
 The unit sturdy holds phone place indication would fall out
 The release lever works well easy pop phone one hand
I would definitely recommend this


 

Fits phone well
 Detach mechanism phone seems secure, workable one hand
 Belt clip secure
Two minor complaints order annoyance:1) outward-facing part clip holds phone place somewhat sharp, I frequently catch arm sleeve it
 Would nice rounded
2) case enough flex, little pressure easily flexes, buttons get pressed, phone beeps
 Not end world means, slightly annoying
Overall, I'd recommend it
 

Product describe, lasted quite good even thought phone outlived clip, I still phone clip got broken, cannot really complain cannot expect last forever right
 

The top latch appears narrow Nokia E71
 Which world's best smart phone
 It hold phone though made durable plastic
 

This far best phone holster ever used phone, PERIOD
 The noticible thing SKINNY is, slim compared I phone, much less noticeable belt
 The belt clip sturdy quite slim, clip hold holster spring loaded positive latching mechanism
 I cant say enough good this, I actually ordered second one case stop making it
 

I received case e71 days ago
 First, quality nice
 Looks nice slim
 Belt clip holds nice solid
 The fit phone perfect release lever worries phone ever falling case
 There things think ordering case, it's hard put case down, need consider like phone screen facing in
 This case phone sits facing case
 If use phone alot, remove case every time need see screen
 This super annoying
 Even glance time, remove it
 I also find little hard work release clip remove phone 1 hand
 It's hard, easy either
 I found working clip trying "pry" phone another annoying issue
 Last minor case removed plug charger
The issues personal
 And bought case knowing screen faces in
 If don't mind that, may great case
 Built nice
 I use now, I'm going try another boxwave case
 There coustomer service fast respond emails, shipped quick, priced fair nicely made
 If made case phone facing out, I would buy it
 I think would issue, issue first hr
 

good holder nokia e71x
 tight, secure easy-insert/removal
 caveat remove phone access charger usb slot
 

excellent fit
 well built
 I broke sitting one day, plan ordering another maybe little careful time
 

This seems like nice product
 However, March 26, 2004, even though product claims work Nokia 3200, actually NOT compatible cell phone
 It fit bottom phone
After calling Jabra technical support (1-800-EAR-2230), said I buy &quot;the basic model&quot; said model needs adapter work Nokia 3200
 You call Jabra get adapter
 They mailing one free, it's obviously hassle
 And honest, I haven't figured &quot;basic model&quot; I need get use adapter
 















































































































































































This cable great transferring data phone computer
 It easy connect use
 



































































































Corporation product I originally ordered
 The vendor substituted BoxWave brand Mybat brand
This cable working well
 A mini-CD included contains drivers cable
 The drivers make phone appear serial device (com5 example)
 I using Windows 2000
You still need additional software manage phone content itself--on 6030 manage audio video content--no contacts, phone numbers, etc
I understand Boxwave package comes drivers *and* trial software
 

I purchased cable nokia 6060 phone works perfect
, trouble all, I really recommend product
 
























































































































































































The "3
5mm Stereo Audio Adapter Nokia" actually stereo one
 I even opened see wiring saw two wires inside (ground signal) instead three (ground plus left right signal)
 I checked found signal contact wired
 Do mislead incorrect description
 The adapter fits OK (with minor problems, need force little), give mono sound
 
























I AT&amp;T 8260, fits fine holster (the Voicestream phone actually smaller slimmer, may fit well, I'm sure)
 This holster probably comparable StarTac holster, although clip swivels (which I yet reach opinion -- sometimes I like it, sometimes it's irritating)
It definitely good alternative leather case
 The spring clip one appears little robust 8260 holsters I've seen
 The platic seems higher quality I've seen well
 I'm quite sure worth $


, I've heard StarTac holster costs same, seems quality
The holster leaves phone face-out, chance scratching face you're careful, I'm worried that
 Otherwise, I real qualms product
 

I enjoyed belt holster it's style, price, small footprint
 Unfortunatly, swivel base cracked two weeks use
 Anytime snag seatbelt, chair arm, article clothing, run risk cracking plastic
 My father also problem exact result
 If extra careful standing sitting phone belt, might break holster
 If like me, however, idea belt clip I don't think carrying phone around time
 That keep making things small, attach body like piece jewelry
 Anyway, I end getting something durable future I suggest consider problem light personal phone carrying habits
 

This holster TERRIBLE
After using holster less week, product already scratched phone
 This product made 8260/8800 whatever is, since 8800 series nokia phones little smaller, holster
 I frequently phone knocked holster insecure fit, thus adding scratches, yes


your face get scratched, too
All all, product junk
 Even slightest activity beyond walking phone liable fall out
 I get phone replaced (thank God Warranties
) result terrible product
 I since bought one Body Glove holsters protect phone well get secure method clip phone onto belt fear continued scratching losing phone
&quot;Final Thought&quot; - spend extra 2 3 dollars get something protect phone
 




















I've case 6 months now, decent job protecting faceplate
 I've problems velcro fastener, either
 A major complaint, though, leather covering metal belt clip tore away weeks use, leaving sharp clip exposed
 This made difficult get clip onto belt, remains leather clip cover bunch top clip
 It also left scratches leather belt, annoying
 Overall, hasn't worn well, either -- seams coming undone, elastic sides fraying
 It makes good-looking phone appear cheap
 

This great product
 It really protects little phone scratches dings I use everyday life
 

The first thing think see faceplate, think "Where's Sparky?" Some don't know is, might thing I'm talking Sparky fire dog
 But no, I'm not
 What I talking ASU's mascott, Sparky Sundevil
You look say, he? Well, Nokia probably couldn't fit it, didn't put there, stayed ASU logo faceplate
Even though Sparky faceplate, ASU fan alumni appreciate faceplate

For 7160 case necessity want protect expensive screen delicate slide
 Bought case becase I've ruined phones hanging belt clip point rear case cracked someone clipped phone
 First leather hard glove soft making removal phone difficult
 Second get grip phone remove case slider automatically pulled open good thing slider relatively delicate
 A case pull flap like 6160 would better design one similar 8000 series mounted sideway better access
 


I disappointed buying Nokia Compact Desktop Charging Stand Nokia 8260 Phones include adapter charge phone
 The adapter provided Nokia work charging stand cos they're apparently different sizes
 And price way high stand 
 :( 

The product listed NOT dual charger


I ordered took month actually receive product single charger
 After research, I believe dual charger yet available 8260, 8290 dual exists
 And keep mind NOT include AC cord


you use one came phone purchase additional power cord charger
 

I recently bought Nokia 8260 stand store phone use
 It makes easy charge phone: easier drop phone stand I get home pick I leave
 I use Rapid Charger came phone
 Contrary reviewers write, cable fits well
 However make sure connect correct side: side cable goes adapter plastic 'bayonet' prevent disconnected; try make side fit stand fits poorly indeed
Other comments charger included space charge second battery
 This true, clearly indicated product information, I don't understand low reviews
 This well-designed accessory designed well
 

I must agree charger stand useful accessory phone
 I must say however, Nokia claim two-slot charger
 Also,it important note plug DOES fit stand albeit - snugly
 Make sure plug going stand right end - notice transformer &quot;wing&quot; shaped slot larger end cord
 If try put wrong side - &quot;wing&quot; shaped end-into charger fit
 This stand useful charger plug simple begin with
 Save money buy buy case phone instead - scratches easily
 

I purchased 8260 phone Amazon bought accessory
 It works great
 The power cord came phone plugs right charger
 It looks great desk I would recommend nice base park phone using it
 Only reason I'm giving 5 stars price bit high get
 

I bought charger problem plugging wrong end desk unit, I swaped ends, fine
 I like able stand phone desk see face pick see calling
 I wish came one unit, power supply along desk top portion instead buy seperatly
 

I received charging stand today I can't say enough great things it
 It EASILY fits adapter came pre-packaged phone takes little space desk
 All drop phone cradle let charge
 It can't get easier that
 

This unit come power cord

 It stand
 There use this, cosmetic
 You use current power source, replace it
 Really doesn't make sense someone would need accessory
 

Glad I checked reviews I couldn't figure fit AC charger I read someone's comments ends switchable
 Once got passed part, charger wonderful easy plop phone in
 

Let start saying people supposely bought Nokia 8260 phone's saying charger fit charge foolish
 There one way plug goes in, end different anyway, tells one side fit try side
 I bought charger works like DREAM, PERFECT, No Problems ever
 Like I said great product
 They better price doe
 

I aware item come power cord
 But I received one I purchased nokia 8260
 Problem is, rapid charger comes packaged phone purchase DOES NOT fit charger
 Luckily, I power cord previous nokia I've owned happen fit it
 So I guess total loss
 But I known hand, I would purchased it
 





Months ago I shopping case, I almost didn't buy one reading negative reviews posted here
 I glad I didn't let pursuade me
 This case best I've seen
 It fits phone perfectly, velcro quite tight, belt hook swivels easily, quite simple unhook phone talking
 I worn phone belt daily months
 It never even come close falling out, unhooking, damaged scratched
 I noticed negative reviews people purchased case starting use it
 I suspect fit phone case tightly
 As instructions state, must push phone hard first stretch leather case bottom corners phone stretch strap completely get total contact velcro pads
 Take heart
 After put phone case times, fits like glove, holds securely, works conveniently, looks stylish
 

If intend car use it`s great
 

I day boyfriend looking plastic carrying case phone
 The one hooks belt couldn't find anywhere
 He one pager doesn't like leather one phone in
 He plastic one phone broken it
 We need find new one I wondering anyone knows place I could buy one
 We mall phone places didn't carry them
 I don't know go next
 Thanks help
 

Ok, I'm glad I'm one who's phone fallen case
 ONLY buy case/clip want carry belt, protection, careful
 My phone fell case today lunch I leaving LCD broken display ANYTHING
 The phone come unclipped, weak velcro holds case closed around phone comes undone, phone slides right out
 But also, provide ANY protection face, fragile part phone, face scratched
 (but also inherent design flaw phone itself) So I going replace phone case/clip provide protection actually prone holding phone
 Back drawing board, guys
 

I love look case, fact made leather, enables phone attach belt
 However, aspects disappoint far numerous:* case makes previously small sleek phone quite bulky cumbersome,* screen phone could easily protected clear plastic cover left exposed easier scratch,* phone cannot placed desktop charger without removing case,* case constantly readjusted velcro closure hold tight case eventually moves front holes made earpiece making harder hear, and* placement swivel mechanism velcro case make difficult phone actually swivel
The velcro closure upper back case, sewn-in swivel mechanism slides holder belt
 The width velcro closure actually closely matches width grooves belt holder, often times pull phone straight remove belt holder
 Otherwise pull velcro remove phone case fit properly again
 That's something want dealing receiving call
It makes wonder Nokia product testing real people releasing case option general public
 

I bought case thinking would protect phone, come close that
 There absolutely protection faceplate, fact hardly leather protect anything
 The phone also prone falling case easily
 The case even claims do, &quot;enhance beauty phone
&quot; What piece junk
 Do buy case unless want destroy beauty phone, I think looks quite attractive without case, potentially destroy phone itself
 

As reported people, carrying case really looks nice, *but* lose phone
 I got carrying case Xmas, lost phone January 10
 It separated clip
 

As reported people, I also lost phone due ill-designed, defective belt clip
 I got clip Xmas, lost phone January 10th
 Pretty sad original Nokia accessory
 

The release velcro swiveled past belt clip cost new phone
Nokia Customer service denied even slightest hint design might slightly flawed
Duct tape around case velcro fastener, provides lovely silver accent, keeps velcro released case swivels past belt clip
The tape removed replace battery becomes necessary
 It rather defeat use desktop charger, accesory connects &quot;standing&quot; phone
 

Fits like champ looks sleek installed
 Velco closure needs work; actually catches belt clip come undone leaving phone flapping breeze
 Case must removed pocket carry unless you're fond bulge pants looks, sewn swivel flimsy prone premature wear
 Beyond that, protection clear faceplate, phone's easily scratched component
 A better idea would close fitting, high quality leather cover plastic faceplace decent belt clip built in
 

I bought case
 The first day phone fell twice
 The mechanism well engineered (Not engineered all)
 I stopped using next day I bought it
 

First all, plainly obvious case doesn't offer front protection
 Other cases do
 If you're looking type protection, buy type case
 This case clearly designed offer portability phone allowing user clip belt -- protective cover
 Don't buy Corvette complain can't go off-road, want go off-road, buy truck
 Second, phone doesn't fall case
 I work office combination walking around sitting desk
 I also wear weekends mild yard-work
 I've never heard/seen velcro enclosure even appear coming undone -- 5 months use
 It may well glued shut
 The case tight fit (which good thing), getting velcro strap initially takes effort
 But that's end it
 I like case lot
 It doesn't add bulk, allows easy carrying phone, leather nice, swivel clip works great, stable
 If use phone environment necessitates protection puts abnormal stresses velcro strap, perhaps look elswhere case
 In fact, I'd look different model phone -- one rugged tiny 8260
 

After reading posted reviews, I found I must attach holder belt, attach phone case holder
 It looks like useful case, since I don't wear belt often wanted hook clip top jeans, case wouldn't work
 I instead purchased Motorola StarTac case
 I removed inside plastic top half case attached Velcro top bottom
 I case clip, closes protect front phone
 It's still easy remove phone case use
 Thanks reviews, helped great deal
 

The swivel case nice idea, happen sit phone doesn't swivel anticipated direction, plastic belt clip break disconnect connector back leather case
 This allow phone fall, worse, land quietly someone else find it
 If shop around find aftermarket leather case fit phone like glove, stiched clip back, like better eyeglass case
 The case also clear plastic vinyl sheet covers keys doesn't interfere dialing all
 (and detatchable wrist strap) I happier aftermarket leather case
 

This case attaches well belt clip problem first weeks use (and sometimes beyond) phone fall case
 The phone held velcro peice near top phone catch stuff (like coat) come undone
 Then phone falls (but case stays firmly attached belt
 Also since case cover front phone nothing protect display phone tends scratch easily
 

Though clip phone nicely designed sturdy, actual leather case leaves much desired
 The case barely large enough strap top phone
 This, along limited velcro surface area, cause strap come loose easily
 Furthermore, phone attaches clip rotational pivot, allowing case turn upside belt spilling phone
 I lost phone 2
5 weeks receiving case
 

Picked I got Nokia 8260 - couldn't find leather case anywhere Amazon built tiny phone
It works GREAT
 perfect size perfect fit - little pricier I'd expected


 

The picture shows NO clear plastic cover

 belt clip post HANG clip (does come it) The description agree picture
 This case 14
99 malls
 Please post accurate picture substantiate price
 Someone please edit description update picture
 I think everyone looking plastic cover front phone protect finish, I buy product I know truly looks like
 

Is possible purchase case protects face phone? since one sensitive easily scratched
 The case also carry clip fixed case (eg; 5160 model) instead hooked belt clip (the phone easily slides case stooping)
 Otherwise comments
 

Nice fit phone convenient belt clip swivels move around



but totally protection scratches impact
I cracked LCD phone I standing near door somebody opened suddenly
 

I must admit case, far best looking case market
 This far compliments go however
 This case designed looks - consideration made performance,comfort, security
 For example, flap closes case closed tiny velcro strip easily &quot;catches&quot; anything comes contact with
This opens case enough merely kneeling phone falls out
 Also, phone unlike previous Nokias NOT made using quality plastics - makes clear lens far susceptible scratching
 This case ideally would covered clear lens thus,alleviating scratching problem
 This leather case also comfortable - sitting swivel &quot;bites&quot; sides
 All I guess - &quot;Good luck&quot; order decide buy case
 

I bought case one purpose mind, carry phone belt clip (versus pocket)
 The clip swivels took lot abuse getting in/out vehicles banging things accident
 If buying case protect phone, much better choices
 The case worked great first year velcro wore down
 After this, top fastener case loosened phone tended slip out



just replace case year you'll fine
 Otherwise, worked great me
 

A worthless waste money, case drops phone regularly
 Finally, I decided using rubber band leather case would make phone secure
 It come loose since
While leaving Ft Meyers Airport Florida yesterday Security Guard asked rubber band holding phone together
 I admit really does
 The phone week old looks like war
 It hit ground least two dozen times three four days
This case poorly made, design okay material required used far sparingly make serious product
 The leather cut back enough appear sufficient falls short
 The velcro drops quarter inch short prevent phone dropping out
It obvious product isn't made complement phone, it's merely make extra dollars
 Had phone broken one drops I never would consider Nokia again, lack attention detail would persuade think craftsmanship may extend phone itself
 

This battery Nokia, honestly works pretty well
 It battery comes phone Nokia 8260
 It charges keeps charges pretty much manufacturer rated it
 I found battery life lasted maybe even little longer Nokia rated it
 This part, may something service provider
 I would definately reccomend stick OEM battery - aftermarket battery I bought weeks one, didn't really last long died me
 As far price concerned,well


 I mystified seems excessive
 This battery alone cost half cost I paid phone itself
 However, consideration spend enough time phone warrant need another battery
 

I purchased Nokia handsfree car kit 6 months ago installed myself
The kit comes almost parts need installations
 Remember also purchase aerial appropriate network though
Installation relatively straightforward, know something car electricals
 Its similar difficulty installing radio-cassette player CD player
 As car installation VERY careful drilling mounting screws
 If damage car's existing wires could major expenses , worst, fire
 You need careful routing aerial cable avoid interference too
 Finally make sure locate holder place won't interfere controls, microphone located place receive voice properly
 Next internal mirror works well Peugeot
If aren't used sort work
 complex vehicle, though , go professional
The kit gives significant extension operational range substantially reduces nasty &quot;black spots&quot; coverage drops normal use
 The phone automatically switches &quot;Car&quot; normal modes, happily insert remove holder middle conversation
The car charging system works well too
 Since using mine car normal mains charger become pretty well redundant
Although seems much safer using phone car &quot;hand held&quot; mode, much less fiddly distracting earpiece/microphone plug &quot;hands free&quot; devices, important remember even full car kit research shows accidents increase compared &quot;no phone&quot;
 Try avoid using difficult dangerous circumstances, especially ringing out
Overall, excellent, well made , product significantly increases utility phone , compared going &quot;hand held&quot;, adds safety 
Rod Hagen 

The nokia car kit product every nokia owner traveling
 You don't type earpiece fumble around worry falling driving
 For safety reasons definately must nokia product users
 

THIS CAR KIT IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO USES THE CELL PHONE WHILE DRIVING
 HANDS FREE WORKS GREAT, AND THE OUTSIDE ANT CONNECTION REALLY MAKES TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE WORK MUCH BETTER
 

I've kit car 3 year, I can't imagine life without it
 In addition excellent sound quality I talk to, also nice features, found car kits
 1) It mute mode either silence shut car radio, depending radio's capbilitites
 This means phone rings, radio goes off
 Useful like listen loud music
 2) If leave phone cradle ignition off, automatically turn phone off, don't waste car battery (or 'auto-answer' calls, you're there)
 Useful leave car garage secure area night
I'd recommend professional installation unless really know way around cars electrical system
 I went car stereo shop, took care $


, including wiring car radio
 My wife also one, car, phone uses car radio speaker phone speaker
 That installation $


 

Great system, except I would like see adjustment phone mount unit
 Currently hides behind stearing wheel
 I removed system one cars started install another forgot mark wires
 Can anyone help wiring, as: red=hot, black=ground, blue=? etc
 

Very good worthwhile
 Had professional installation ATT Center
 Microphone sentive picks voice fairly
It allows hands free answering 
 Next step hands free dialing
 

I kept old analog Motorola car phone years I didn't want trade something stuck cigar lighter whistled speaker on
 This Nokia kit really works since mike mounted visor, handsfree doesn't whistle
You need know you're install it
 The local Cingular service department installed kit charge since I already customer
 

Folks, dont think it
 Just buy beleive me, happy safe using cell phone car
 Beleive me, best thing ever purchased
 




I ordered Amazon - I got battery marked &quot;Nokia&quot;, packaging someone called Cellstar, said responsible warranty coverage, etc
 I don't know Cellstar gets batteries, I expected brand new Nokia product, Nokia's retail packages, prices - mysterious grey-market repackaged stuff
 

I almost didn't order product Amazon, earlier review said battery repackaged warranty covered Cellstar
 In case misgivings based upon review, battery arrived original Nokia bubble pack, 1-year warranty covered Nokia
 

The 8260 uses BLB-3 (920 mAh) battery 8290 uses BLB-2 (650 mAh) battery
 So good battery models since doesn't fit 8260




 

The capacity high
 But good enough Nokia 8260 8290 models 





The belt clip made Nokia 8260 practical comes keeping phone vs
 floor, however, clip short cannot even make around average belt like phone clips (aftermarket otherwise) do
 Therefore, cannot place belt without worrying may still drop phone
 

While looking pretty cool abscence &quot;case&quot; clip simply practical
 The clip looks pretty neat phone
 It NOKIA emblazzoned clips leg pretty low-profile seems unobtrusive
 The problem I found clips leg expands way little slide mans' belt - normal leather belt matter
 I ended sliding edge pants back pockets instead
 To make matters worse, find comfortable place hang clip, leg short slips off
 So basically - doesn't expand enough fit around belt clip short phone falls off
 Incidentally, trying open clip wide - fit visor car - I broke &quot;spring&quot; opens closes clip itself
 Obviously, I returned - I would recommend clip plan actually using clip
 This clip designed slide mounting bracket Nokia hands free car kit - CARK-120
 I guess works fine capacity - flimsy everday use
 

This style clip 8260 really clip Nokia make
 The clip needs ablility clip better grip
 I found stays belt carefull let phone drop
 

It's great use car, less great belt


The mobile holder comprises two parts, "belt clip" "base" (not shown Amazon)
 You replace battery cover came phone, belt clip illustrated above
 You attach base to, example, dash car (4 screws provided, could also use double-sided foam tape)
 When you're car, take phone belt slide clip slot base
The clip holds phone quite well base
 It won't fly unintentionally driving, yet easy clip in/take desired
 But clip bit short slippery hold securely belt
 It's unworkable, less stable than, say, Body Glove's swivel clip
This holder inexpensviely gives secure, unintrusive place put phone car, also providing belt clip
 So there's trade-off it's utility car belt
 

The &quot;hinge&quot; clip low phone allow one clip pocket, purse, etc
 without risk falling (i
e
, top phone becomes exposed)
 I Ericsson phone hinge closer top phone worked perfectly
 This one doesn't
 I agree everyone else clip short belt
 That leaves practical use hook onto stationary object - mobile phone holder car
 I use holder I used Ericsson phone works well
 

I LOVE THIS PRODUCT
 THE CLIP IS SO SLIM LINE THAT THE PHONE CAN STILL FIT IN MY POCKET
 THE ONLY SMALL PROBLEM IS THE CLIP DOES SLIP OFF THE INSIDE OF MY POCKET
 I WENT TO WAL-MART BOUGHT A LITTLE VELCRO DOT AND PUT IT ON THE CASE AND NOW WHEN IT IS IN MY POCKET THE LITTLE HOOKS KEEP IT FROM COMING OUT
 I LOVE THIS CLIP NOW THAT THE VELCRO IS THERE
 

So maybe clip isn't practical usage belt, works great keep place handbag briefcase


Before attaching clip, phone forever drifting bottom bag
 Now, isn't problem

 




The description says closes zipper - mine uses velcro
 The leather fits tightly first stretches little it's used
 The clip seems sturdy; unfortunately, scratch score surface belt phone pulled wrong angle (perhaps seatbelt, brushing something)
 One favorite belts scratches that
 The leather nice quality, soft touch, dye doesn't bleed gets wet
 The case cover earphone charging jacks bottom phone, completely obscure IR windown side 8290, phone must removed case use IR features
 It may apparent photo, case cover/protect surface LCD display keypad, may scratched splashed; I haven't trouble that, would preferred crucial areas phone better protected exposure
 Nevertheless, I'm pretty happy it
 

This case good allows get functions 8290 phone, plus protects drops
 The included belt clip cool
 It one best clips market
 I wish make see thru though
 




I purchased phone "back up" event main phone became inoperable (which did) I digress
 This phone great basics only
 Texting, speakerphone course voice
 The call quality o
k
 speakerphone functions fairly well, texting hassle, search letters numeric value keys (I'm used qwerty key board) I agree previous review, get pay for
 

This works good someone wants easy thing plug go, wasn't good solution
 First, I want use cigarette lighter (I need radar detecter) I didn't want speaker hanging dashboard
 Second, car (Audi A4) cigarette lighter awkward location near gear shift
 I place speaker upside work, cables flop side
 Third, phone doesn't click like normal hands-free kit does, stick two cables little holes time place cradle
 And fourth, need replace battery cover one clip attached order attach cradle
 This adds little bulkiness phone people carry pocket like I do
I don't know Nokia can't make real hard-wired hands-free kit 82xx phones like 61xx phones
 The phones becoming real popular
 

Out box, kit bit joke
 The 61xx nice easy use kit, bit bulky required plugging unplugging every time car
 To make life bit easier I took mine top-notch customizer installed kit permanently, thus eliminating need use cigarette lighter
 However, getting around plugging cables phone
 Also, light version hands free kit, way get auto-mute stereo
 All all, hands free kits nice accessory keep road safer
 Your best bet get one Nokia gets together real kit 82xx
 Just spend extra bucks someone install permanently
 

As reviewers, I wish Nokia would make real car kit 82xx series
 The big pain always plug unplug power speaker cables
 I thought plugging unplugging worn speaker/mic plug phone people I called would complain static would go away I moved speaker plug slightly
Now I new phone still probs
 The power speaker plugs &quot;Y&quot; cable Nokia made speaker plug cable &quot;Y&quot; little long
 This puts pressure phone's receptacle causes bad connection - poor engineering
Also, car doesn't turn cig lighter's power turn ignition, I always keep pulling cig lighter turn off
It's shame solution available Nokia
 

First, instructions terrible
 You "rocket scientist" understand pictorial installation/configuration instructions tiny scrap paper
Second, product advertised swivel mount
 But try get swivel doesn't
 I even got touch Amazon
com, got touch Nokia
 Nokia told definitely supposed swivel
 So Amazon
com sent replacement
 Guess what? The replacement also doesn't swivel
I contacted Nokia wait 2 days reply
 Their answer I use allen wrench loosen tiny hex screw
 Once I loosened screw I could adjust mount
 This joke order loosen screw I would go purchase special allen wrench tiny size screw
 A swivel mount supposed swivel needed basis without requiring special tools
 Nokia lot nerve
And "hands-free", it's definitely not
 You still take hands steering wheel answer phone make call
 It's also distracting wire hanging top windshield visor
 It creates problems solves
 

I agree last review great option 8260 owner
 Its easy install, inexpensive works well pricier options
 Ive mine 2 years well problems
Give try, won't disappointed
 

I can't believe reviews product
 I using one two years everyday 45 minute drive work
 It works great
 Of course plug in, also move easily car car traveling trade cars without pay fortune uninstalled reinstalled
 To reviewer whose cig outlet stays on, I wish mine did
 There little drain enough ever discharge car battery
 I would leave mine car every night fully charged mine stayed ignition off
 You press button answer dial 8260 takes button answer turbo dial programmed one button dial number
 I wanted buy one wife's car unfortunately longer available
 One thing, I never bothered trying install dash mount I leave case clips belt
 

I bought Sharper Image hands free 82xx - one hear again
 Bit clunky works well - clear hear, mic works
 Extended use drains battery (used pwer speaker recharging net zero loss)
 Overall though works advertised, cheaper, plug go
 

This hands free kit great idea, requires little installation keeps hands wheel driving talking
 Be safe, use hands free kit driving 



I Dock N Talk 3 years love it
 With Nokia 3285 even picks phone automatically I never touch phone I'm driving
 

This valuable item car
 I speak heard well hear speaker
 

I thrilled I found product, two months seems verge breaking
 The piece clips phone longer clicks properly, slightest jar comes out
 Also, ability use phone headset product never seemed work quite well, I'd lose connection midst conversation
 Overall, I still able use product, works it's great
 But flaws
 I think best deal get wireless phone built-in speaker phone
 

I bought product I must send back
 One little prongs cord broke off, remained bottom phone
 Fortunately much effort I able remove prong phone
 It seems many reviews share problem item
 Also, fitting phone secure, move phone wrong way, cord comes out
 I think could good product problems resolved company
 

If purchase speaker, careful clip phone small plastic hooks
 Mine simply broke 2 days, make speaker useless
 It pretty bad
 Too bad it's nice speaker
 

Perfect device hands free talking car
 Charges drive use service
 The price makes great deal
 I've compared similar modules (professionally install dealer models) item 1/3 expense
A must driving
 Speaker unit good distort high levels
 

The first one I bought (from here) quit month
 I think connection speaker end cable intermittent
 It convenient work I bought another month became erratic, too
 &quot;Fool once



etc
&quot; 

This unit worked great


for 1st two weeks regular use
 Then tiny plastic connectors holding handset broke, rendering useless
 I see replacement plug sale
 Now I know give away coupons making item essentially free
 Too bad, otherwise seemed pretty good
 

Pretty simple
 It sounds good always charges phone
 Have turned cell phone speaker phone
 Works well office I need write something talk time
Good buy



 

I Nokie 5165 charging station doesn't hold well all--the slightest bump tap phone slides right out
 And cord connects phone heavy bulky
 Nope, don't like item all
 

This car hands free made really well
 I use office
 Would like get one wife
 Ericsson available? 

fragile tempermental item


needs better quality control manufacturing 




































































































I got phone first became available, mid-contract (so cost full $250 priced first came out) hot thing get Nokia (for awhile) due incredibly small size
 It's really good phone--too bad cell phone company I got from, Edge Wireless, isn't
 It's said amazingly small compact, colorful elegant still cool

 Highly recommended someone doesn't know much cell phones--it's hot, easy use

My Nokia 6101 good, clamshells fumbly candy bars, I ordered Nokia 3120
 That mistake
Unlike previous reviewer, mine delivered promptly
 Return address box Smart Tech USA Houston, TX

Very unhappy phone
 It cuts randomly, I take battery reinsert it, turn back on
 I tried using battery previous phone, model (the number 5 work phone more), phone still work properly
 

Tho phone came Indonesia headings named Nmerican names
 The phone update raoming codes, often without service
 We unable resolve issue service provider
 

I preface saying first phone I've owned
 That said, layout pretty straightforward, lots little functions tucked away make life easier; dated reminders alarms, countdown timer, email, etc
On negative side, display impossible read strong light
 Time displays nice big font screen dark -- good luck seeing lighting conditions
 And case mandatory -- easy lean buttons pocket
 

I wish I could write something phone I waiting close 3 months thing, it
 

I puchased Nokia 6101 3 months ago
 From I've seen last phones I've owned phone take lot damage I've dropped several times, suprise still works efficently
 I've read reviews talking phone one said atenna falling I believe talking diffrent phone atenna model apart phone
 Another thing I like probably personal prefrence record phone use record ring, way don't spend money purchasing ring tones on-line
 I hope review helps finding phone fits you
 

Unless planning making occasional phone calls device without holding many contacts personalizing ringtone, phone you, especially price
 The lack internal memory prevents saving handful games, pictures, ringtones, text messages without causing lock due "lack internal memory"
 There many better phones available better prices, especially T-Mobile To Go customer
 If use To Go, purchase terrible phone (like this, cheaper) SIM card, upgrade Unlocked Phone Amazon
 You won't nearly frustrated (unless try download T-Zones, hassle, I would rather phone able download) I been, wasting money downloads discover won't fit in, even I barely anything phone
 Unless customization control phone (instead way around) aren't you, run away NOW
 

The Nokia 6101 sets bar high VGA-quality digital camera self-portrait video capture playback
 Plus, there's FM stereo radio built-in, smart instant messaging software tells friends online
 With plus great Nokia operating system advanced voice-activated dialing menu features, you'll happy chose new Nokia 6101
The Nokia 6101/6102 truly one kind
 The phone fits hand heart, phone smiles back you
 Weighing 3
42 ounces, handset surely lot offer
 The Nokia 6101's ease use comfortable form factor make rather impressive
Audio Messaging well Picture Video Messaging processed almost instantly handsets EDGE capability
 Nokia also famous FM Radio also included
 This flip also boasts two full color displays
IN SHORT:EXCELLENT TOP QUALITY - CERTAINLY AN THE CHOICE FOR SIMPLE LONG LASTING QUALITY PHONE
- EDGE CONNECTIVITY - SUPREME LOUD VOICE AND RECEPTION QUALITY- GREAT CAMERA - GREAT QUALITY PICTURES- FM RADIO - CAN ONLY BE ACTIVATED WHEN PURCHASING A HEADSET (NOT INCLUDED)- LONG BATTERY LIFE
- MADE FROM STURDY MATERIAL - BUILT TO LAST
 HAD IT FOR 16 MONTHS - HAD MORE THAN THE USUAL BEAT-UPS OF MY CHILDREN - NO PROBLEMS
 

I've owned 6101 2 years never problem even dropped twice still worked great reason i'll purchase another withstand 250lbs person acciendetally falling enjoyed phone 

It's phone - there's one feature prize others (and it's durability)


 sound quality
 With phone, need earpiece certain angle hear conversation
 Going way, microphone's weird location maximizes wind noise
 Many people commented poor sound quality spoke phone
So it's good conversation
 What else I say phone?How cannot connect using cable that's supposed supported? Try this: Google "Nokia 6101 Enhancement Not Supported"
 Message boards filled people unable connect phone PC
Another complaint vibration soft easily missed
 My old LG strong vibration could feel phone pocket
 I missed many calls phone due weak vibration
The compliment I pay phone I like "spell ahead" feature figures likely words trying type text messaging
 That worked better I expected
 

I got phone little year ago, within first week I knew I didn't like it
 It's poorly made, interface archaic, literally NO memory anything text messages
 That one good thing phone, I could store 300 messages once
 The gallery held 15 pictures given time, anytime someone sent picture, you'd delete gallery even view it
 The screen went blank 3 months, darn thing habit turning whenever wanted
 I never abused phone dropped average owner, get go piece of


I'd pleased every Nokia I'd ever purchased before, disappointment one rather shocking
 Stay away costs
 

I Love The Nokia 6101 T-mobile


 I got free Activation T-Mobile back day
 It first phone nothing came close taking spot
 Its one best flip phones there
 I would definitely buy another one


 I really great times Nokia 6101 T-Mobile


 

This phone durable
 Mine hit floor destroyed
 Going back samsung
 

I've 6101 2 months it's working already
 It dropped since quit working right
 It would work speaker phone, sudden screen stopped working together
 You can't hardly hear person you're talking to, I used push phone hard ear barealy hear them
 This phone NOT worth money, advice, spend something else
 

Definite durability issue, antennae mine ready fall off
 The menus confusing (as Nokia's) unless familiar them
 I'll looking go back LG easy use menus

 













NAZTACH ULTIMA CASEVery pleased product cost
 The item arrived promptly
 Would definitely recommend product
 

Husband's phone fits well
 No excuse take
it along him
 Fits great belt
 Thank 

Second one I've owned
After two years frustration multiuse phone felt like brick required much babysitting, I went back simplicity clamshell phone
 Then I scoured Internet I found case grabbed it
Perfect every way

The one fits phone
 It's 2nd oneI military type Samsung phone
 Hope thisone last phone
 

This case nice
 It trim workmanship great
 The flip great woeks well
 I use small phone
 It smaller flop phones still sold
 I kept chance I find small phone next change
 I smart phone user flip phone choice
 Again, superior case high style smaller flip phone
 

Exactly I needed Samsung flip phone
 Looks classy works great
 We'll see long hook lasts seems made well
 

Great case dressing up, or, casual
 Very well made looks good
 Great value


 

All cases I've bought phone retail outlets broken within months
 This one holding quite well
 Also, magnetic "clip" eliminates another potential mechanical failure
 Excellent choice
 

After comparing hundreds cell phone cases, one
 Great quality, great style, great convenience
 

We purchased son Christmas - nice quality - HE LOVES IT 
 

I received Naztech Ultima Cell Phone Case Truly Black disappointed find "360 degree Swivel Belt Clip", advertised, instead standard pinch-style vertical belt clip locked position (the kind tends fall belt whenever bend waist)
 Even packaging included case listed "360 degree Swivel Belt Clip*" one product features
 However, tiny asterik package informing buyer 360 degree Swivel Belt Clip available cases
 Of course, information available on-line ad prior purchase
 This kind false advertising "non-similar substitutions" reflects poorly upon Amazon influence family's decision purchase Amazon
com future
 

It said good small/medium flip phones, extremely tight fit phone
 Every time I put in, hits buttons side sets voice commands, turns speakerphone
 It waste money
 My phone small Samsung flip
 

I purchased holder Amazon time ago smaller cell phone
 Its long I remember exact phone I used on
 I bought Iphone going replace holder another Naztech
 This item fantastic regards
 The magnetic flap keeps ticking
 I expected degradation time never occurred
 Great styling fit clip
 Cannot say enough good things item
 A steal price
 

This case strong sturdy case
 It's made well
 It looks good, feels good worth every cent
The top flap secure closes
 It's uses magnet secure flap strong
The clip back tight strong
 It also swivels, nice feature
The thing I would say I wished fit little tighter around phone
 That's minor compared quality thing
 It's great
 Love glad I bought it
 Well worth money


 

I saw amazon
com, I liked antique brown color, pure leather look
 Unfortunately, I got it, didn't look like posted online
 It looks feels like plastic
 far I still sure leather, leather smells all
 I really disappointed
 

The clip broke first day
 Bah
 Went Verizon got better made case
 It much better
 

Take notice
 This item swivel clip described
 As reason I selected item others, disappointment
 It otherwise nice product
 

Great case
 Well made provides excellent protection cell phones
 This second purchase product Naztech managed make even durable time
 Highly recommended
 

Very sturdy well made
 Will perfect protection I looking phone
 Very stylish too
 Wish I got another
 

I bought Wife

Nokia BH-301-LT Bluetooth HeadsetThis Nokia Bluetooth headset came exactly described (the faceplates cute
) I able use soon I charged problems
 I'm currently using Samsung Blackjack 2 connected fast easily
 Everythign intuitive
The ear piece little funky compared Bluetooth headsets, it's one-size-fits even though ears quite small, fits nice figure (push in)
 It's still slightly loose shake head really fast I yet find one isn't
 The call clarity reception great, though slight bit background noise something turn loud hear things, however I asked friends heard anything, said didn't hear anything different could hear fine
Also looks really cute paired pink Nokia 7373
 &lt;3 

Doesn't take long fully charge; full charge gives alot talk time
 Fits great ears, comfortable
 Easy use, I like power button larger button outside answer, hangup calls, even gives option voice recognition calling

I bought product unlocked Nokia N95 awesome kept phone secure clean I traveling
One best products amazon Nokia N95
 

Well, fits nokia N95 makes look nice, I think it's well designed, 'cause use cellphone lot sliding down, eventually one part case get broken (the 'rails' part)
 The 'rail' system durable made hard work
 

expecting little better quality make things worse item streched proportion due paper insert placed properly
 

Got silicon skin Nokia N95 back cover loosen up, use hold battery place
 I'm really satisfied brings
 Easy use, helps protect phone
 It great job
 

Nice case, fits phone perfectly, looks great
 Was delivered pretty fast, can't beat price item
 I thought screen protector, hadn't, buy separately
Overall, i'm glad bought case
 

pretty good makes phone bulky ended ripping pants pocket
 pretty good though recommended think i'm gonna pick another one
 

This silicone skin case fits N95 perfectly, shipment Eforcity quick well packaged, would like deal again
 






For chance get 9 them
Every time I use it, break within 3 days
 

Two cents worth plastic, worth disgust I felt I opened bag
 This product sitting pile garbage next desk I write this
 Shame merchant
 Don't buy snake oil, might nose grease
 

received broken product twice, nice custommer service re-send package


anything else good product protect phone
 

I definitely recommend crystal case, believe perfected yet accommodate profile structure N95 cellphone
 Low quality plastic breaks really easily
 

Extremely poor quality, faceplate started getting cracks 2 days I got them, fell off, back plate fall off
 Not recommended all
 

The cover broke within days normal use,don't get it,it's worthless
 

I bought crystal case brand new Nokia N95, fits perfectly advertised
 Good looking time delivery, nice
 







































































































I normally don't buy brand chargers, I one ruin phone once, I decided take chance since Amazon offering it

Definitivamente NO vale la pena, pretendo hacerle mal nadie, pero este producto en particular se da&ntilde;a en seguida



la parte que se introduce en el prendedor de cigarros del carro es muy sencilla y al parecer se da&ntilde;a con facilidad
 































































































































This phone work Verizon cell services
 I bought replacement phone, found phone version mostly used Europe, even though ad says US version
 Not US carriers activate phone
 

A nice phone basic uses, frills
 It long battery talk stand by
 I pleased audio speakerphone function compared old Motorola camera flip phone
 Small compact, fits shirt pocket, light weight
 A nice phone cost
 

This cell phone quite good one
 It talking alarm-clock it
 The sound level quite good one
 sure wake ringing
 It also right size
 There's quite good rechargeable battery
 It takes week empty
 Two games quite good (Snake Xenzia Rapid Roll) Soccer League stupid one
 You always take easiest level
 Well, quite good cell phone, reminders quite good
 

Lets straight; tiny phone bought one reason, replace main phone 2-year plan beyond one-year warranty
 Nevermind reasons original phone dead, end day, would cost almost $150 replace thru service provider, anymore else matter
I needed cheap unlocked phone last next 3 months I free replacement I re-sign 2-yr contract
 This phone it
 It minor games, keypad isn't small, sound crystal clear excellent speaker
That said, I wouldn't buy phone have
 The menu hard understand, keylock doesn't seem work, saving phone numbers tedious limited
 

I bought Nokia 1600 replace fancy-pants Motorola V600 went haywire hinge became loose (after 3 years)
 Moving parts always break first, clamshell phones me
The 1600 no-frills, it's really gem
 The phone's sound quality screen excellent
 I also confirm previous review regarding battery life: It seems last forever charges quickly, too
 (And it's good free horrible Motorola charger connector
)Only one complaint: The UI isn't finest I've seen
 Too many menus I don't care I haven't found way disable hide forever
 (But maybe I read manual
 ;)The feature I miss Bluetooth syncing, that's complaint
 I knew missing
 

As reviewers noted, basic phone lot going it
 It cheap unlocked
 It's small light
 The battery life excellent
 You get least one bar places usually lot more, I'm saying detects signal well
 Most importantly, dropped calls yet
 That's biggie me
 My motofone f3 dropped calls I replaced Nokia
If want basic features make/receive calls text messages, you'll satisfied Nokia 1600
 I took one star I'd like see still better signal strength
 I old Nokia 6061 seems even better department
 

The phone simple functional
 It fairly small light, good sound quality, neccesary text-messaging features
 It even comes (or least package came) earpiece, I started using convinient
 The price excellent
The drawback (other lack advanced features, I consider drawback) menu somewhat unintuitive compared standard Nokia menus
 Also, I check missed calls, always (or rather, nearly always) displays annoying dialog saying "No new numbers
" These major problems, I would preferred absent
If looking simple phone don't need advanced features, I think good choice
 

I bought phone wife last month (April 2008) pleased far
 We using Nokias years mainly reliability, ruggedness & ease use
 We also AT&T contract rather tied another contract decided buy unlocked phone
 Well, got charged slipped Cingular SIM Card (circa 2005)and worked great
 She loves compactness phone additional "bells & whistles" compared old Nokia bar phone years ago
 Don't get wrong isn't another iPhone basic needs
 I old Nokia bar phone plan order phone I get chance
 Note: One nice surprise Nokia includes hands free ear piece box
 Also,all old chargers previous phone still work 1600
 

This great sturdy little phone
 It lots features, use Bluetooth, setup option menu user friendly
 This replace rather fragile phone young disabled adult son
 He even commented easy use change things on
 I'd highly recommend it
 

Pros: Cheap covers basic needs
Cons: None price, small screen
 

Overall, good, cheap, basic phone
 It works fine text messaging phone calls, I use phone anyway
 It keep charge 1-2 weeks used, stays charged even long phone calls
There annoying quirks phone, though, research phone I bought it, I discovered others similar problems:1
 If reject call, sometimes phone freeze you'll need turn back again
2
 If let phone ring don't answer call, continue ringing indefinitely, even caller hung left voice mail message
 I've left phone home I left work, got home afternoon phone still ringing 9:00am phone call
 If try answer then, freezes and/or makes three-tone beep ear
3
 The alarm clock doesn't work properly
 It likes go around 3:30am regardless time set for
 When goes 3:30, check says alarm actually set 6:30 (or whenever set for)
 Sometimes go several different times night
*All problems intermittent, none happen every day
 

If looking decent-unlocked cell phone great one
 I purchased Sony Ericsson Cybershot broke using new iPhone comes out
 Big ups Cingular/ATT intelligent enough SimCards I didn't go store make change
 

Fantastic
 can't ask price I paid
Voice clear, light weight, battery recharge quick last really long piece comes hands-free set(wired)
 

The Nokia 1600 cell phone I purchased accept telephone numbers I put phone book
 I didn't think better cell phone I old Nokia
 

Great basic cell phone, almost week battery power ~ best I've ever had
 

I've phone 1 month buttons already starting sieze up
 Chinese crap
 

Great signal strength, good sound quality, battery holds charge good week, easily
 Can't beat price
Annoying features:not flip phone face buttons easily pressed unless lock keys
 Menu features center square button cumbersome
Ready step line
 

Me like phone
 Make phone call
 And get call phone too
Phone good


fire bad


 

My SIM card didn't work product
 Make sure will
 

Phone really cheap, But doesn't work expected, When caller disconnected calls call picked up, still phone keep ringing
 screen display also changed
I tried another piece also, It problem
I wouldn't recommend phone someone
 

Just got phone
 Love way looks feels
 Went Sprint activate/switch old flip-phone Nokia 1600 find DOES NOT WORK WITH SPRINT

 What suprise
 Sure would like known $51
00 ago
 

well wanted basic phone thats bought one
 Phone sturdy nokia bar phones are
 problem hangs quite frequently receive call
 keypad wont work restart phone everytime hangs
I process sending phone back

may one bad device sucks nevertheless
 I wont buy again
 

nice cell phone
 like compact simple style
 however, bug operating system
 unexpected behaviors sometimes
 times freezes need turn turn on
 dont know possible fix reinstalling operating system USB connector
 

My old phone terrible reception ever since I bought it
 Since I going traveling, I wanted reliable phone
 This phone got great reception everything I need phone
 Not alot "bells whistles," basics battery life wonderful
 I used recharge old phone everyother day, one lasts week needs charge
 Would highly recommend anyone looking good phone great reception thoughout US
 FYI, I AT&T service
 

Easy use phone great battery life fair price
 I didn't need kinds bells whistles
 Keyboard letters little small texting overall I satisfied
 I want saddled 2 year extension cell phone provider unlocked phone key

 

I puchased phone aid Amazon cell phone specialist told used SIM card Europe Black Sea
 He assued unlocked phone ordered appropiate SIM card also offered Amazon would work
 Needless say didn't work Europe Black Sea area I contacted Moble, SIM card company, told phone would work US
 This poor advice Amazon cell phone expert fortunatly didn't serious emergency needed reached call out
 Also Amazon cooperative resovling issue allowing return phone full credit
 

Considering years newer previous Nokia 3125, I figured would qualaties least, better
 Unfortunately old phone turned far superior 1600
 This phone similar, I couldn't find 3125 less least one hundred dollars more, I went cheaper model
 Long story short


 shows
 A lot things phone same
 The fact I cannot save text message, cannot view kind picture sent another phone, importantly cannot send text message without taking numerous tries environment makes phone kind downer
 I'm sure number things phone annoy me, main complaints
 I numerous brands styles cell phones, going number options, I liked Nokia 3125 best
 It simple, intuitive, fit needs
 Hoping I could get quality phone slightly less money, I gave lot quality department
 Don't get phone unless last 50
00 dollars need something communicate with
 

I wanted cell phone worked well cell phone, clear audio good battery life
 This exactly I got purchase
 I pleased recommend it
 

If looking basic functions less price,this best option
 

When first opened thought made big mistake light cheap feeling
 However, surprisingly good sound quality use hands free earpiece still works really well
 

I got one case something happened regular cell phone
 Turned needed, worked well, I got another one put away event something goes wrong one
A great little phone money
 Unlocked great too
 Sometimes frills nice
 I really pleased purchase
 






















































































































Price, shipment product alright
The flaw: English Arabic languajes menus (and english one spelling errors)
Nevertheless, sister happy it
 

Haven't problems phone yet
 My wife likes she's always kind phone still takes beating
 Solid design good software 




























Well even though product looks good, struggle make fit
 The plastic tore trying fit (bottom section)
 I would recommend buying this
 









































































































Nokia really always setting standard cell phones
 They making longest basically manufacturers could copy interface can't go wrong
The Nokia 6230i looks cool (stylish silver black) exactly right size cell phone - feels good hand fits nicely pocket
 Its also impressively fully featured price radio, mp3 player, speaker phone option, camera (still moving), wireless connectivity, infra-red, Bluetooth, push talk numerous features I haven't discovered yet
The technology stage camera stage quite perfect - low light/indoors photos bit grainy 3gp video files generated don't like things move quick
 But current state art - give years taking perfect quality photos able record whole day commercial quality video phones - ever get need
If Nokia designers around couple things I suggest
 Firstly MP3 player fast forward/reverse pausing easy skip next track
 Also, filling text message using auto-predict punctuation marks take long time navigate finally "screen saver" display show time
But minor gripes, otherwise excellent phone 
 







The case even fit Nokia 5300
 It looked cheap impossible get onto phone
 I returned day I received it
 

The product 2 parts, 1 : The upper portion, covers display
 The lower portion, covers key-pad
 You slide OPENED phone top, key-pad cover sliding first close phone, i
e
 slide display, goes display cover
Problem: The key-pad cover slightly touches internal part display (back) side causing warp many times problem closing it
 All all, good product, sense leather quality durable, plastic covering hard belt-clip slides off/on easily
 There's 2 holes behind camera+attenna, you've physically move slightly proper clear view, camera used
 







3rd purchase Krussel
 cases consistently fit well, bulky ugly
 

The Krusell case fits Nokia E61 well
 It covers entire front phone cut navigation joystick
 I read reviews complaining plastic front accidentally pushing buttons, I problems
 This comes clip only
 I like swivel clip I buy it
 However, multi-adapt clip system makes easy change
 I would suggest install clip putting case phone
 I bought another Krusell case another phone I sold them
 The quality great always great fit
 

I bought item Nokia E-61i
 Yes, although says E-61 add, also works E-61i
 But things consider:*First, cut-out access camera, since E-61 one (and case made E-61)
*In beginning, bit difficult slide E-61i since, seems, E-61i little wider E-61, though thinner
*I bought pouches cases cover keypad
*As gets bit tight, little difficult type first
*Make sure lock keypad device use, since "tightness" cover make easier inadvertently dial number function item pocket bag


*The cut-outs kind fit E-61i ports satisfactorily, althought exactly, interfere charging neither plugging headphone it
 It okay volume buttons too
 The thing covered, I said, camera
 You completely remove case use it
 But I seldom use camera, okay me
*As almost every product Krusell, material high quality
*The spring clip incredibly difficult attach
 I remove case device attach
*Despite this, still good item, since products pricey bulky (besides covering keypad, something do, opinion)
 

When first bought oke outta package noticed unimpressive quality, figured would worth comfort noise cancellin quality
 buds fit secure problem first time went use one bud split half sitting car touched, reattached fell again
 Also u spin input jack around connect bumb fuss work one ear
 overall worst purchase made life
 

Bought product May 26th


it fell apart May 28th
 Sound quality cheap
 Spend couple $ get something works
 

First sound quality definitly lacking
 No base all
 Then earphones trouble getting sound ears without constantly resetting plug phone
 Then within week, one earpieces broke off
 I would recommend all
 

sidekick 3 headset didnt work 1 side work 

I bought product I could listen music day I received used minute I went take one ears broke
 This headset worth money 

Too flimsy sound listening music phone horrible
 Also ear pieces don't stay well
 Waste money
 

This worst purchase I've ever made
 DO NOT BUY THEM
 Good thing $5
00 Even going use music they're junk
 I opened immediately disappointed see cheap made
 Not even worth dollar
 The sound quality faint, tons static, absolutely bass
 I threw away even 10 seconds listening them
 Pay extra money get nicer ones, did
 I can't believe sold 29
99 one time
 haha 

The head phone sucks
 It's loud enough distorts everything comes out
 If turn volume thing amplifies static
 Not worth $5
 It basically going trash bin
 

I bought I small openings ears trouble using hands-free headsets
 I Sony mp3 headset resembles thought would perfect solution, especially money
 Now I understand they're "reasonably priced" because, even though fit ears nicely, worth $1 sound quality horrible, cheaply made, on/off button doesn't work makes rattling sound vibration, earpiece fell apart second day I them
 I picked head work piece fits ear fell off
 Fortunately, I crazy glue handy able glue back together, it's major inconvenience
 Fortunately, I ordered pair Jabra C220's excellent fit, well, ear gels narrow enough fit ears, GREAT sound quality
 I've used many Jabra headsets inthe past always liked them, I found less cheesy MBat's, I'm thrilled I went ahead ordered order
 I'll probably give MBat's ex-boyfriend use stereo cell phone
 LOL


 

Shipping quick, product arrived new condition; however sound quality tinny (no bass)
 One ear buds fell apart time I took ear
 I used superglue re-attach plastic pieces side doesn't work all
 Oh well, price right shipping quick
 

The headset poor phone quality (it sounds like there's tornado right next you) earpiece broke two pieces
 It waste money, I can't even get refund shady cell accessories store
 :( 

I didnt think I would actually get good product price, awesome
 (I LG VX8100
)1
 They fit comfortably ears
2
 The call volume good
 It doesnt sound perfect means, hear people you're talking fine
3
 Voice dialing flawless
 The mic picks commands translates without problems
4
 People I call reported could hear well
5
 Design good
 They dont look feel cheap
All all, fantastic product price
 If you're looking cheap alternative bluetooth headset, pick up
 I would highly recommend them

I bought lot screen protectors, hard install well, worst
 Impossible install well start peeling edges almost immediately
 Also, I bought 3-pak one three missing altogether package
 

I ordered screen protector one designed specifically Nokia 770
 I received white envelope nice
 It came one screen protector, piece cardboard iron air bubbles cloth
 I wiped screen well cloth, I applied screen protector, process I got tiny piece hair/lint it
 It clear visible I turned device
 I unpeeled feat itself, tried get rid lint ended getting way lint scratched protector process, going washing instructions screen protector lost it's adhesive-ness
I recommend stay away product it's frustrating apply
 If can, find non adhesive kind stick out, screen fine nokia 770, I paranoid
 

Installation quick fairly easy
 Screen looks protector there
 


























Good case


functional charger


*headset NOT COMPATIBLE Nokia 1100


* Completely different connector type


LOOK CLOSELY product photo
 

The pack quite described
 Any one three itemsmight justify small expense
 

Good purchase
 Although I used headset yet, case charger work perfectly
 Great savings
 Amazon place shop discount
 







I love simple little belt clips
 Every time I get new phone I always order two
 They cost almost nothing keep phone closer belt fancier ones
 I'm even sure I get brand every time get distributor
 I buy two spring clip breaks I'm getting car something
 This one new problem though
 One time I getting phone out, little tab top broke off
 Now I'm belt clip number two
 Hopefully won't happen again
 

FALSE ADVERTISING
 This holster waaay big phone, Nokia 6126 - phone literally falls out
 Unfortunately I bought two, it's worth returning shipping twice much cost items
 I'm bummed
 I'll contact see help me
UPDATE: Regarding seller, AccessoryOne, said have
 They offered refund cost I return items, would I spend another $6 shipping $3
50 refund? VERY DISAPPOINTED


 

I like use belt clip holsters cell phone years
 I recently upgraded phone get new belt clip
 Bought couple cheap
 When came mail, I little surprised - appeared built better I thought would be, least well ones I've used (and broken
) past
 I especially like little tab side makes easier remove phone need get it
 It also seems hold phone little securely holster I previous phone
 I always bumping something, causing phone come loose fall ground floor whatever
 Haven't problem clip
 Have using almost month problems
 Oh, like rotate clip, one 4 click stops vertical horizontal
 

I'm guy buys clips 10 time, I somehow always caught om something broke spring loaded part, I 4 5 different brands phones clips, first one lasted months far still going strong, sure I use spare ones I bought first one going last long
 



















































































































































Bought pair batteries wife's phones would last two days standby
 Talking phone charged battery would drain less half hour it's charge
 The original Nokia's (about $40 each) would last least week standby give several hours talk time
 I recommend battery
 


































































































Great cel phone price, common commands, it's rugged design make safe felt down
 

I astounded battery phone
 Unless I using phone heavily, I recharge phone every third day
 It best looking phone, I need something rugged fits bill
 



I actually bought HS-3WH, thing white
 The cord thick looks awkward doesn't run smoothly shirt, goes zigzag pattern (like wrinkly headset)
 Also earbuds little larger hard get fit correctly ears
 Mine fallen many times
 The thing saving buds falling ground neck strap
I owned mine month problems
 At first one channels going left headphone eventually I lost entire left side
 The microphone also gone I know people 'other end' cannot hear me
 The concept really good, need work design
 

As thing designed consumer submarines 1950s, probably last worst usage uncomfortable
The cord thick protective metal like coil
 Earpieces also sound good feels durable
But sturdy cord design makes uncomfortable
 Stiffness cord makes earpieces move ear move phone
 Earpieces largest I seen far
 They comfortable
 

I waited writing review make sure I actingrashly
 I've headphones month now, use NokiaE61, nice music player
They without doubt worst headphones kind I evertried use
As reviews say, earbuds strangely large
 They largethat stay ears
 I confident would evenstay ears George "The Animal" Steel, even hair thereto provide extra grip
They barely stay I'm standing still
 If I anything radical like nod,yawn, swallow, turn head 45 degrees, almost guaranteed fallout
 If don't quite fall out, nonetheless require readjustment
 I ama 6' 2" (maybe 3") guy dainty ears much I might like to
I've never problem kind ear device before, ever
The stiff cord help situation
 The cord extremely heavy andthick
 It's also totally bizarre looking, mighty strange somethinglabeled "fashion" headset
 It's possible might fashionable 20,000leagues sea, accessorized fishbowl head
I willing give cord texture chance, stiffness helps itnot get tangled tendency shove bag pocket withoutcoiling them
 However, turns totally annoying
 You're guaranteedto flinch whenever snaky scaliness touches skin
 It's rigidity meansit's hard hide cord
 It always sticking loop away fromyour neck waist somewhere
 This unattractive, makes kindof dangerous getting caught doorknobs unsuspecting small childrenwhen walking around
They sound terrible
 There crackling general lack body thesound
 I'm audiophile I know enough know I've heard bettersound come free headphones get airplanes
 It's phone
I get better sound phone's loudspeaker, unfortunately peoplegive funny looks train I turn on
 I could, however, put upwith sound quality shortcomings traumatize so
I never even tried use microphone
 I also don't understand youare supposed use it
 On (height previously mentioned), microphonehangs around sternum
 I don't think hear there, Idon't see way adjust microphone cord
 This meansthat order talk, hold microphone mouth
This moving cord cause headphones fall out
 Rinse andrepeat
I don't know I'm going now
 There many options available forthe Nokia pop port way stereo headphones phone mic
 Iguess I'll try over-the-ears ones next
I'm fan Nokia products general inexcusable
 

sounds OK, awkwardly designed, voume control, remote control, answers hangs calls
 stupidly produced primary phone function rather media player
 Nokia needs learn lot headset manufacturers design headset
 what's more, it's costly like jewel
 

The headsets good, present/display great durability spite daily excessive use I give him, addition attractive elegant color
 

The buds barely fit ears get feels like stretching out
 Feel light cheap
 One earbuds started going 2nd day I them
 If buy these, don't pay bucks really aren't even worth that
 

The first time I used earpiece cell phone I loved much I tried adjust mouth piece person I'm talking me
 It would nice would came instructions adjust mouth piece, overall I love earpiece
 This best earpiece I far
 I would recommend earpiece anyone cell phone use earpiece phone
 

Took forever realize clasp used fasten headphones around back neck
 Would've nice shipped *some* manual show put adjust them
Do this, won't problem mic low -- raised lowered pretty easily securely
 Plus take earbuds let dangle since looped around neck
Now I could get earbuds IN
 The previous reviewer right: I'm sure designed human ears
 

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































If 8260 series Nokia phone, fan style, case you
 Unlike similar Body Glove cases 8200 series phones, madel fits 8260 perfectly
 It's durable, protects phone, look GREAT
 The caveat you're sporting custom faceplate, like Matrix faceplate, phone may fit case
 



fits perfectly Nokia 3360
 I can't vouch knockoff faceplates, works well Nokia brand plates
 Recharging also effortless using charger came phone


 need remove case
 The metal, plastic coated belt hook great hanging phone jeans
 As color, I love blue (looks sharp gray plate), like changing faceplates, I'd go clear
 I definitely recommend case protect phone elements, add bulk, won't interfere phone usage
Almost forgot, also comes lifetime guarantee
 

THIS COVER WAS EASY TO PUT ON THE PHONE
 IT SLIPS ON &amp; OFF LIKE A SATIN SHEET
 THIS PARTICULAR COLOR HELPS ME TO FIND THE PHONE IN MY LARGE BLACK POCKETBOOK
 

This poduct, opinion got best nokia 3300 series phone
 You wan't phone look stylish also want use it
 This case allow phone express it's true beauty state art technology also allow use it
 It also gives phone maximum protection, hence subject, moisture, heat, elements
 I using case week now, I love it,and I'm sure person(s) giving enjoy well
 Ciao
 

I owned phone case 4 weeks now
Pros: The case looks, feels fits great
 The accesability buttons phone display wonderful clear plastic front case
Cons: The snap top covers power switch phone
 It possible turn phone without unsnapping top cover, difficult
 I don't necessarily turn phone off, need access function button silent mode
 Also belt clip secure phone safely pants
 This second phone case
 I never problems first case (not Body Glove) coming pants
 This new case inadvertently unclipped pants 6 times (dropping one time toilet
)
 My fear course damaging losing phone
 

This phone case easy use looks great
 It light slim weight dimensions stay basically same
 The phone fits nicely case, protects mostly phone
 The snap whole bottom charger hands free jack still visible still use them
 The plastic cover screen buttons protects nicely
The case made well belt clip nicely designed
 OVerall best phone case ever I highly recommend it
 You can't find anything better this
 It deserves 10 10
 Buy one 

bought case AT&amp;T Wireless, extremely happy it, phone never goes center, fits well case, even though cant see power switch, still operate un-snapping lid case
 thing hard take phone case


the plastic sticks screen 5 minutes, great
 

I purchased case 


 fairly happy it, feel always room improvement
 My main gripe case phone wants become "off center" inside time
 I find open case twist phone around little re-center display keypad within clear plastic face
Aside minor quibble, good case prefer accessability cell phone attached belt via swivel-clip
 


 



I ordered case new Nokia 3360 phone
 Unfortunately, I found negative aspects case, likely mean I continue using it
First, seen product photo, case cover top corners phone
 If happen drop phone one corners, protected
Second, belt clip attached case effective
 The clip smooth, nothing prevent sliding move lot
 I clip phone skirt, belt, perhaps makes worse, I never problem another manufacturer's phone came belt clip case
 This, combined unprotected top corners, resulted several scratches corners phone (and I've phone couple weeks)
Finally, reviewers noted, intend take phone case frequently, case you
 The fit snug, taking occasionally okay, it's effortless could become irritating several times day
 Also, dirt make way case phone, clearly visible
Aside things, case well made keypad easy use plastic
 The holes power headset adapters minimize need take phone case
 If don't plan take phone case frequently, don't need belt clip, could work you
 

I wrote previous review item I first received it
 It NOT published, I suppose I'll write another review, sum comments bit
 My first review item MUCH negative, granted I item hour simply went mind trying get phone case
 But, continuing on
 
 
I'm big phone cases
 Never been
 I think defeats whole purpose buying attractive faceplate
 Although, since recent switch 3390, size phone really prompted think otherwise
 This pretty much ONLY case I would use
 It's high quality item backed lifetime manufacturer's warranty (or says packaging)
When I purchased case, I impression plastic NOT cover buttons
 I wrong
 It appeared way picture seam around plastic front
 When I saw this, I thought I would HATE feature
 Well, weeks use, I don't
 It doesn't bother all
 In fact, I kind like it
 I doubt anyone else would mention this, woman wears makeup, face pressed phone minutes, makeup remnants gather around buttons plastic covering display
 The thing happens cordless
 Well, I don't problem
 WHOOOOPEEE

 LOL Granted get smears makeup plastic, that's MUCH easier wipe off, compared picking cell phone buttons fingernails
 Anyway
 
 
This great case
 The reason I gave 4 stars instead 5 difficulty remove phone case
 The first time I tried get out, I swear I almost mental breakdown
 I switch two batteries avoid waiting charge, simply NOT good case intend using two batteries
 I still do, I realize take 5 minutes constant pulling, shifting, struggling get out
 Now I little practice, awareness necessary maneuvering tactics improved
 It's still pain, though
 But, DEFINITELY WORTH IT protection phone stylish flare
If someone take case away me, I'd probably go nuts
 It's much easier hold phone now
 Just keep one minor detail mind, though
 The metal belt clip covered plastic seems take finish faceplate
 There shiny markings back faceplate two spots
 Normally would really irritate me, since I don't plan using phone without case, really isn't big deal me
 I thought I'd mention anyone might care
All all, I think it's obvious I pleased product, I would go without it
 If care displaying faceplate, case you

 I bought two them
 I would bought more, availability stated two left
 Now I really wish I could gotten give gifts
 Something keep mind future purchases Amazon
com

 

I've always wondered people spend lots money faceplates phones, hide leather case
 Body Glove's Prism Cases allows better show inner you, least, outer phone
This case solidly constructed
 High grade, heavy clear vinyl used throughout
 A rugged, continous seam holds case together back
 A positive snap button flap top secures phone place
 A solid metal clip comfortably holds phone belt
 The front sides seamless, (unlike many cheaper clear cases) outside world sees snappy looking phone beneath slick, glossy vinyl sheen
 What's more, phone won't get scratched nearly easily, you'll always &quot;new faceplate look&quot;
This cover change feel phone
 The vinyl, unlike plastic shell phone, quite grippy, you'll find drop phone less often
 If do, vinyl protect scratches, impact itself
 Well placed holes expose microphone, speaker, headset, recharging jacks, you'll problems there
 The screen plainly visible, buttons accessible, including power button top
 As protective cases, leather, otherwise, clear vinyl take away feel buttons, it's harder operate phone touch
 Also, sweaty ears hands may want get absorbent leather case instead
 And case made today compatible desktop charging stand--you'll take phone dock it
 Taking phone case difficult first, gets easier tries
Despite issues, it's beautiful case beautiful phone
 If you've spent money make phone look nice, Body Glove worth price
 No case enhance look phone better
 

This case great job protecting Nokia phone
 What I like best clear design allows &quot;designer&quot; phone cover visible
What I dislike case little specks dust debris work case phone
 To irritating look at
 The case fits snugly, makes taking cleaning away dust bit challenge
 Also, manufacturer says power phone depressing button area top phone without unsnapping case
 Even fingernails, I find untrue I need unsnap time I want power phone
 (probably also contributor dust entry)What I like case excellent job protecting phone
 I dropped phone slid across floor
 No damage phone case
 :-)My comment teenage son's remark saw case: said looked like one plastic slipcovers grandma would put sofa
He's right, it's stylin' leather case, it's excellent protection, water resistant allows custom phone cover show though
 

got one brother's 3360 couldn't pleased
 made soft elastic plastic stretches enough {i'd say perfect} cover entire phone, keypad, screen
 thing VERY snug fit
 brother wrestling case phone worry case would snug press keypad
 


no worries there
 it's perfect &quot;glove&quot; fit phone
 

Just received two Nokia 3360 wife's phones
 They great
 Fit phones will
 The holes charging ear bud, speaker, etc
 perfectly placed
 This quality procuct
 

This case Body Glove provides excellent protection scratches covering phone almost entirely
 The plastic covers face phone interfere operation phone, much better quality plastic fronts aftermarket leather cases
There openings bottom case access car cord /charger handsfree jack
 The slim belt clip sturdy large enough fit almost belt, secure phone pocket
This case bulkier leather case, fits 3390 well as, better than, OEM leather case Nokia provides
Overall, possibly best case money available today
 

I received Nokia 3390 weeks ago decided I needed case protect it
 Not sure one buy, one caught eye I decided give try
 It fits PERFECTLY


 tight, loose
 I easy access ports recharge hook earpiece problems pushing buttons
 I happy product
 

It looks functions great
 However, I got new faceplate cannot remove case
 It's giving headache
 I don't want tear/rip it
 Bah
If plan ONE faceplate entire time, case great--if not, good luck taking off
 

The snap closure broke within first week
 Despite reviews, case tight enough hold onto phone without snap
 

I bought clear blue versions cell phone case, I'm completely satisfied purchase
 The case fits like glove, I really didn't experience problems connecting charger headphones case on
 Also, removing replacing case problem you've figured best way - makes easy use phone desktop car charger unit
 The case makes using buttons phone (Including Power ON/OFF Button) easy without case
 And style design definitely cool
 Very good product
 

I bought clear case protect phone still show attractiveness phone
 It perfect fit wonderful detail
 The edges woven clean &amp; neat threads clear Body Glove Logo imprinted side
 I impressed operation phone cover place
 The keys easy press - right amount resistance
 The resistance even prevents use lock keypad phone purse pocket
 I LOVE IT


 A great find


 

This strong protective, best all, completely transparent case keeps phone free scratches knocks, also low-profile belt clip
 It allows expressive phone cover revealed glory, unlike leather versions, spoil look phone
It fits VERY snug, however, bit pain charging mounting phone, plugs don't fit properly holes case tend fall out, increased width means phone won't fit dedicated mount case on, removing bit struggle
Sadly, therefore, although I love it, I end leaving 90% time, defeats purpose
 

I ordered case new Nokia 3360 phone
 Unfortunately, I found negative aspects case, likely mean I continue using it
First, seen product photo, case cover top corners phone
 If happen drop phone one corners, protected
Second, belt clip attached case effective
 The clip smooth, nothing prevent sliding move lot
 I clip phone skirt, belt, perhaps makes worse, I never problem another manufacturer's phone came belt clip case
 This, combined unprotected top corners, resulted several scratches corners phone (and I've phone couple weeks)
Finally, reviewers noted, intend take phone case frequently, case you
 The fit snug, taking occasionally okay, it's effortless could become irritating several times day
 Also, dirt make way case phone, clearly visible
Aside things, case well made keypad easy use plastic
 The holes power headset adapters minimize need take phone case
 If don't plan take phone case frequently, don't need belt clip, could work you
 

I bought case 3 months ago satisfied it
 I dropped phone numerous times scrathes anything wrong it
 I found bit pain pressing menu button, fingernails helps
 Whenever friend asks use phone quick sec, tend complain this
 Its phone I like it
 I find reason phone still works
 

I wanted nice case holding cute phone
 I changed cover wanted able display cute color
 And perfect case it
 I feel phone vibrate fine case clipped pants pocket
 The reasons concern phone still gets dirty breaks cover, really unavoidable
 And clip loosened use
 Other that, it's great case displaying phone fun colorful - can't hide
 

I lOVE THIS CASE

My screen starting get little bit scratched up, normal use, decided would good investment buy case
 I going get standard Nokia Leather case, didn't really want to, nobody could see shiny red faceplate
 This product caught eye, amazing
 It works well, fits well, buttons still easy access, really protects phone makes less slippery, overall, GET THIS PRODUCT
 

I looked every case new 8260 Nokia Phone
 This one far durable best looking
 

This nice belt-clip cover Nokia 8260
 The belt clip strong comfortable, easy disengage call comes
 The cover keeps phone protected
 Almost features phone accessible glove, exception volume buttons side
 You'll probably need turn speaker volume little muffling effect
 I like one best ones I looked at
 

I bought case month ago pleased ever since
 I must admit, I bit sceptical spongy neoprene might add little much bulk Nokia 3390, something I definitely wanted avoid
 I pleasantly surprised find really didn't make much difference size/shape phone all
 I work outside physically demanding job previously caused leave phone bag elsewhere fear damage
 I don't miss another call I wear phone every day peace mind well protected elements
 I also appreciate freedom movement swivel clip allows
 I highly recommend product
 

I tendency drop things, gives peace mind
 I've alread dropped phone twice, Body Glove protected times, phone suffered ill effects
 It looks great, feels comfortable, fits snugly belt
 Buy it
 

The case quite sturdy, took less month break belt clip I getting car
 Nevertheless, I'm ordering another one -- one I'll treat carefully
 

I worn phone belt cellsuit everyday almost two years taken abuse otherwise would killed phone: I dropped phone many times, spilled (small amounts of) liquids it, got caught rain, bumped scratched kinds things, phone still nearly new condition
 Like reviewers, I broken belt clip once--you purchase new belt clip separately, cheaper buy whole new cellsuit
 This product well worth money, although may able find couple bucks cheaper shopping around
 

I buying second one these
 I wore first out, bad thing
 It lasted year rough use, protected phone MANY falls
 I impressed well belt clip holds on, better one I found
 I finally shattered plastic belt clip tore front plastic smashing scraping many times, phone still works
 

I bought cell phone case 8260
 While securely holds phone belt clip, clear plastic phone pad isn't "flush" actual buttoms phone, making difficult dial keytones
 All it, isn't bad cell phone case
 This case would definitely gotten 5 stars clear plastic front "tighter" flush keypad
 



I'm glad I rejected opinion reviewer said bulky stuck far
 The case fits perfectly, holes line appropriately
 The knob swivel belt clip TINY
 This case rocks


 

I case year
The neoprene provides good protection even phone dropped
The transparent section case allows ez access keys problems pushing them
 It also keeps facial oils make-up keys
I love swivel clip
I problems plugging phone car charger
The disadvantage case moves bit around phone covers phone's screen
 So NOT see far right left screen
 That is, covers signal bars battery bars
If important I recommend product
 Personally I've enough sliding case around see signal bars looking another case
 

I think fit like glove
 After phone replaced (after numerous drops), I bought Body Glove case new phone
 It really keeps protected drops keeps sliding around car
 

WOW
 What great case
I avid leather case user years, wanted try something different I purchased body glove case Nokia 3390
 I fell love right box
Pros:Perfect cut - fits perfect
 No extra fabric
Nice window - The front plastic soft, large making really easy punch buttons
 Most other's difficult
Perfect Holes - You know cases, holes charge accesories don't always line up?? Well prefect, right money
 They even made sure mic open
Great Stiching - As see stiching really well done, back even cleaner
Nice bottom Flap - The phone enters bottom, bottom flap secured nice, large, snap
 What novel idea "flap" bottom case

Great Belt Clip - The "swivle belt clip" favorite many
 The swivel belt clip "knob" securely sewn back
 No worries piece coming out
 And low profile still put phone pocket choose
Cleaning easy - instructions say clean neoprean(sp) hand warm soapy water
Color - I purchased blue/silver tints exactly like phone
Cons:With "fabric like" material, I anticipate getting dirty faster, I said before, it's big chore wash it
Color - comes blue/silver black/silver (okay big deal right
)Belt Clip - belt clip sturdy, however rough edges inside "clip"
 It left bit mark leather belt
 I plan fix small piece thin sticky felt applied inside clip
Well, that's it
 I wish I purched one sooner
 The price kept away before, TRUST ME I discovered well worth money

GREAT CASE
 I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NEW PHONE AND I LOVE IT
 

NO SIR DON'T LIKE IT
 SENDING MINE BACK
 TOO BULKY
 DON'T LIKE THE CLIP SYSTEM
 IT
 STICKS OUT TOO FAR
 I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT HUNG DOWN MORE INSTEAD OF STICKING OUT
 IF YOU USUALLY CARRY A 20' TAPE MEASURE OR A PAGER MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE THIS
 BUT I THINK THIS PHONE IS FAT ENOUGH ALREADY
 



The sleek design definitely add's character phone
 It increases general size dimensions, sometimes help phone already small
 One difficult thing I found though keypad seemed less accessible it's bulkiness, belt-clip definite benefit
 The phone also rattle it's vibrate mode
 

This clear case definitely reveals stylish design Nokia 8200
 The case fits perfectly


 It holes openings exactly be
 So clear access volume control, charging plug, headset plug
 The thing I don't like case toughness material
 The plastic stiff, making keys harder push
 Since keys already small, case cause user lose accuracy pressing buttons
 I can't &quot;zoom&quot; around keys anymore--you can't quick keys, I rated '4'
 

I recieved case, I love it
 I used ugly, bulky leather case expanded size phone bit
 This case fits like glove, maintains original size phone
 One thing, bit hard get case on- expect struggle
 But it's it's on
 

Note case work Nokia 8265 work stretch case customize holes
 I'm sure 3360 case would work phone
 The 8265 larger older 8260 I knew case would little small
 I stretched case phone would fit modify holes works well
 

I Nokia 8290 tugging pushing help friend got phone in
 Then I noticed spot cover phone later I took (it came easier went in) putting back second time went much easier although took work
 It clips easily belt stays put
 All cut outs right spots hear heard normal
 The buttons work easily plastic
 I satisfied product
 

I purchased accessory phone husband I share, wonderful
 We pretty hard phone case protects really well, without impairing sound quality phone, ease dialing
 I always throw phone purse I go places, takes trip store around town, tendency toss seat truck
 It seems get banged around quite bit, case helps protect everyday bumps jolts without making bulky uncomfortable handle, seems hold better leather cases market
 With price tag $20, great investment opinion I would recommend case anyone compatible wireless phone
 

I've case less half year
 I really liked look feel case
 However, 4 months case started peel corners
 After quickly disintegrated, tears pieces outer layer falling off
 Also plastic covering display blocks arrow part menu button 5165
I would buy 

I privious experience body glove cell suit I loved it, When came time get another one I found switched swivel type clip
 I want clip searched alternative, find one
 Reluctantly I purchased cellsuit
 It four months clip broken twice
 I contacted Fellowes maker switching back static clip
 Wait type clip happy phone cover
 

Unlike reviewers said I found swivel clip coolest thing case
 The swivel clip solid works well
 The case nice first although didn't quite fit phone (a Nokia 5165)
 Also, although hole bottom attach external earphone, hole bottom attach charger
 Still, worked pretty well six months use neoprene started rip shred
 Now it's shredded around power button microphone
 So I guess I going try leather case although it's easy find leather case swivel clip leather case fit's 5165 anymore
 They say phone's date
 Oh well
 

The information item Website correct
 It compatible Nokia flip-cover models 6162
I really like product, I can't use phone
 

After I bought Nokia, I purchased standard Nokia leather case w/belt clip, case bulky (about doubling width phone) difficult remove belts fairly thick
 This cell phone case, hand, everything I looking for
 A cover LCD keypad, water shock resistance, plus snug design keeps phone &quot;portable&quot; without adding unneeded bulk
I also purchased similar type case Palm handheld year ago, I sold durability reliability, I saw cell phone case made material, I knew I quality product would supposed to
 This quality product protect investment reasonable cost
 

The neoprene case nice, BUT belt clip garbage
 It 100% light plastic breaks touches rubs agaist anything clipped belt
 manufacturer needs make metal clipping version plastic one light breaks EXTREMELY EASILY
 I 3 week spend anymore $ them
 

I nokia 5165 always worried getting wet, dust getting keypads scratching screen
 Well don't worry it
 It looks stylish, I love logo
 Fits perfectly
 The best thing swivel clip comes with
 And even shock proof
 So worried phone don't insurance it
 This you
 

I bought case less two months ago, &quot;swivel&quot; belt clip already broken off
 This product biggest piece garbage I ever bought
 They construct something durable everyday use
 The case difficult slip phone perfect fit means
 Save money buy another brand
 

A nice neoprene cell phone case keep dust cell phone dry it's raining San Francisco, I recommend case anyone looking one
 

In opinion case fails important characteristics:Pros:-looks pretty nice-Durable resistent-less expensive otherscons:- 8260 fit well
 There holes accesesories make own
 You cannot attach handsfree, example
- belt clip somehow small
 At beginning seems good use realize size apropriate
You better go case designed specifically 8260 whatever phone have
 

Although I really liked material case made of, almost impossible get case phone
 If actually got case on, power button near impossible use
 The clip hardly stays anything, case simply makes phone bulky deal with
 I personally bought 8290 sleek small, case ruins sleekness Nokia had
 

purchased two these
 one black, "i use work"
 one blue," use stylin"
 case good shock resistance protects phone completly 




 contrary reviews goes good makes phone look stylish 






 

I knew I would need protective case new Nokia 5100 series cell phone I saw online picture clear, vinyl prism cell phone case "Body Glove" 


 looked attractive wise have
 And since I ordering pretty faceplate phone order too, better way show new, pretty faceplate transparent case? The "Body Glove" transparent Prism Case truly excellent
 It quite snugly fits phone, impossible put on/remove
 There's one snap top bottom; little hole bottom recharge phone's battery without needing remove case; case doesn't impede hearing callers all, callers hearing you; transparent vinyl good, STRONG, heavy gauge and, yet, still pliable soft enough press buttons right thru vinyl make calls; unobtrusive belt clip works well completely unnoticeable holding hand speaking phone; front back pieces sturdily sewn together, belt clip back case
 I'm very, VERY happy "Body Glove" Prism case Nokia 5190 cell phone
 I truly haven't found even one thing wrong product
 I'm happy I ordered it
 You too
 

A case cell phone almost mandatory want save literally dropping dead
 The difference dropped phone without case one case naked one probably become new desktop paperweight encased phone live call another day
So case then? I've gone several black, leather faux leather spandex models
 It's like model-T Fords came black cell phones first came black blah gray
 But phones least face plates attractive finishes, bundle black? Or try fashion-coordinate phone colors case colors ? The clear Body Glove Prism case great job, fits sleekly, lets design features cell phone show through
 And didn't Finns Nokia probably work really hard artistic designs little cellular friends?So let's showcase appreciation
 






Nokia 3360, first cell phone ever me
This product fits extremely snugly (had coach little get on)
 All ports open plugs, etc
 Buttons actually easier press plastic covering
 In case it's obvious photo, screen buttons phone covered clear plastic
My complaint drab color selection
 

This case fit perfectly good job protecting phone
 The case appears durable last long time
 

This saved phones falling quite times
 Fits well functional
 The style nice well
 

On whole, I found quite nifty case Nokia
 It's easy grab, fits nicely


and I problem overly tight either
 Two minor quibbles: You use bit pressure on/off switch phone tendency belt loop work loose belt
 

Coach little? I practically use hammer
 I actually pull tab stretch little, snap barely worked
But I got there, case I've seen seems protective phone easiest maintain keep clean
 

If you've got Nokia 3390/3360/3320 (the case fits perfectly), way go
 The clear plastic window protects keys showing faceplate might've installed 
 
 
 truth told, I found 3360's keys EASIER press case off
 The case holes optional headphone, plug charger, power button/IR port, worries there
The included swivel belt clip means sit quite comfortably without phone jamming side, unlike belt clips
 More I shifting around sitting, double-take make sure phone still 
 And press button, phone unlocks slides clip, still it's case
 Ahhhh 
 
 
The neoprene looks 'cleaner' unique typical faux-leather, pleasing touch
 It also extremely 'grippy', ie : hard drop accidently
 My complaint case makes getting phone wee bit difficult, certainly enough detract it's overall goodness
Highly recommended 
 

The neoprene gives bit extra padding help protect phone inadvertant drops hip checks
 The swivel clip allows phone swing comfortably way sitting getting in/out car
 I like removable clip feature allows clip stay belt click phone comes away
 

The long awaited Body Glove case Nokia 3390 longest wait I had
 But I tell you, best case I ever owned
 It's rugged
 Strong
 Comfortable hand
 And constructed strong neoprene
 This case nothing like I've ever seen
 It doesn't even compare leather cases many vendors overcharge for
 I cannot stress enough searching case withstand test put it, body glove one
 A must buy
 Excellent product withstand elements design withstand
 Invest Body Glove

] 

This best case I ever owned
 I find sticks all
 The swivel clip makes comfortable, I don't know time
 The quick release nice feature, tugging belt struggling get phone back belt
Somebody mentioned holes line up
 Yes do, well enough I continue use voice dialing problem
 I concerned would change voice signal enough make re-record
 Nope
 Works first time, every time
Summary: Hard go wrong case quality comfort want
 

This nice accessary even thought kinda stick should, provides easy reach area reach phone
 But accessary








so it's optional
 The thing I like product it's water resistant
 I go camping lot know going come handy
 And it's also shock absorbant I drop (although I dont' know I drop great phone)(and cover sticks like velcro hand(expression, doesn't mean feels like velcro,haha))but anyways I drop it, nothing happen


 I'm kid high school, crazy enough throw phone across room nuthin happen








although recommend u don't this






it proves nothing happen phone drop it
 Don't drop purpose
 But it's nice feel safe handeling phone worried dropping it
 I would recomend might easier keep pocket











 

This best accessory I gotten phone yet
 It protects phone nicely, looks really great, price terrific
 If Nokia 3390 phone I highly recommend case
 

NO SIR DON'T LIKE IT
 SENDING MINE BACK
 TOO BULKY
 DON'T LIKE THE CLIP SYSTEM
 IT
 STICKS OUT TOO FAR
 I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT HUNG DOWN MORE INSTEAD OF STICKING OUT
 IF YOU USUALLY CARRY A 20' TAPE MEASURE OR A PAGER MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE THIS
 BUT I THINK THIS PHONE IS FAT ENOUGH ALREADY
 

If &quot;normal&quot; size battery (not slim one) spend good half hour getting thing phone
 Once you've completed initial task, enjoy wonderfully designed product
 The belt clip good
 The pivoting attachment sturdy come undone press button
 The clear cover easy dial gives total protection phone
 It comfortable handle looks sharp
 BUY THIS ONE

 

I really love case
 It fit nokia 5165 w/ ease
I love snug swivel clip
 I ride horses stays attached perfectly I trail
 I also love fact I drop phone case cushions it
 Wonderful product

 

This case holds shape unlike leather cases, tend strech shape
 Body Glove stays tight looks good, even though water resistant I wouldn't throw water
 

This phone case impressed protection offered Nokia 6160 phone
 The phone fits snugly case
 One good thing case is, absorbs heat generated phone
 The Nokia 6160 I possess generates lot heat I use periods excess 45 min stretch
 So offers good protection ears

 :) I would recommend buying 6160
 Its reasonably priced quality kind protection gives phone
 

As everyone stated, tight phone difficult align holes buttons
 So sure align holes buttons BEFORE struggle get it's nearly impossible remove without ripping seams
 Other that, I like it
 Thanks
 

Amazon lists case compatible Nokia 6162 phone, flip keyboard cover
 This case flip phone, way accomodating flip cover
Otherwise, exactly I'm looking for, neoprene case swivel belt clip


 

I got case prevent Nokia 5165 getting scratched, fits tightly, stitching around plastic case actually scratched phone screen I removed phone
 A shoddy product
 



Since I bought Nokia 8290 small size, I didn't like leather cases I found bulky
 Also, didn't fit right made either 8260 8290
 I almost bought Nokia's leather case, didn't cover screen keypad I didn't like swivel clip tends scratch belt
 This Body Glove case almost perfect
 It sleek stylish cutouts buttons attachments
 The drawback design belt clip makes impossible attach phone one hand
 

The three stars nothing quality case
 Amazon
com offers compatible 8260 - buy 8260, doesn't fit

 

The Body Glove 8200 series certainly nice small fit Nokia 8260 phone
 In fact, packaging materials said designed Nokia 8210/8250/8290
 In addition, reviewing websites, I found Body Glove 8200 series looks slightly different one made fit Nokia 8260
 So beware you're ordering Body Glove Nokia phone make sure it's right one
 

After ditching leather case I looking alternative protected phone ALL THE TIME (you remove unit leather sideways case order use it)
 I looked Body Glove neoprene cases, I found bulky also holes handsfree, charger etc, opted one
 I haven't looked back since
 It's snug, handsome, offers fair amount protection falls etc, don't remove perform basic functions
 Highly recommended
 

I bought Nokia 8200 series phone - phone looks exactly like one pictured above
 As far comments fit, case new snug hard snap close, stretch little time gets easier close
 That one things I like case - doesnt add real thickness phone still protects looks good
 I dropped least 10 times hard surfaces damage
 I know people dropped phone without case display cracks easily
 My disappointment I give 3
5 clip - fallen belt several times without whole lot force
 The clip strong, move belt getting car fairly easily brushing something
 The phone light wont even know missing
 I actually lost phone way, amazingly enough someone left voice mail returned it
 

I speak others, case fits 8260 perfectly
 This case exactly I hoped would be
 



The Ion's slim case allows fit phone small storage place dashboard cases bulky
 But case's good looks marred tacky metal BodyGlove logo (smaller dime, thicker) stuck side
 It makes unwanted fashion statement, metal logo scratches anything painted comes contact with
 I carefully pried logo two small holes leaves improvement original look
I also think belt clip positions phone high, makes uncomfortable wear sitting
If need slim case, may best choice, cheesy logo bad clip position makes disappointing purchase
 




This perfect case Nokia 8290 phone
 I ordered day I got phone thrilled arrived days later
 Unlike cases I've past, case fits phone perfectly, without usual gaps sags
 You operate phone's functions case on, still maintain thin profile
 

I second Nokia phone (due fact I dropped numerous times)
 This best purchase I made protected new phone
 The belt clip sturdy long enough clip phone pocket
 

My girlfriend, sister, purchased Nokia 8290 around time
 I, however, one bothered purchase case
 Not coincidentally, I one exchange phone due damage
 My sister somehow managed completely destroy LCD point worked, somewhat, phone case partly pried off
 My girlfriends phone suffered similar problems, however, severe
 Most likely, problems due dropping phone many times putting much pressure (piling books, bags, stuff)
 However, I've dropped phone height 15 ft
 onto steel container (accidentally slipped pocket sitting bleachers football game), I've dropped numerous times waist level, I've sat countless times accident, type abuse think of, phone subject to
 Yet, three us, phone funcitoned perfectly day (1 year+)
 This great case, wraps snuggly around cellphone
 All cutouts right place
 You can't go wrong this


a great investment save headaches later damaged phones
 

This good case fits phone perfectly right box
 No stretching make fit, fits like glove
It also adds bit grip phone littleslippery sometimes itself
 Recommended protection againstincidental spills scratches
 

Ok I cell phones since weighed 50-Lbs
 And times went I kept getting best time
 And course cases go them
 Well let tell ya Nokia 8290 phone best yet
 And little case Body Glove doubt best cover I ever had
 Fits phone 100% gaps loss spots
 In fact belt clip tight it
 I can't get clip pocket half time tight is
 It's like rubber phone perfect fit
 

I ended cutting thing phone throwing garbage
Perhaps root cause problem I don't possess musculature necessary get fit - remove phone case try refit it


Once case phone, good
 Unfortuately due misalignment I couldn't plug phone charger, could I snap case closed
 My 230 lb boyfriend couldn't remove either
AAAArrrggggghhhh
 

I using case 2 months I love it
 The case provides excellent protection phone, point many cases fail
 It perfectly form fitted phone protects well
 The clip nice well makes easy wear
 The case also adds &quot;cool factor&quot; phone
 Overall, excellent accessory
 

I phone case 8 months far protected phone
 I dropped several occasions (2-3 ft drops hardwood floors, pavement


etc) time phone came undamaged
 You need understand case offer little protection screen keypad due fact extra protection hinder view screen keypad performance
 There plastic film covers screen keypad protected phone scratches excessive wear
Also careful phone case buy
 The Nokia 8260 8290 look exactly alike 8290's much thinner
 I 8260 model accidentally bought case 8290
 The phone fit properly all

The complaint I belt clip weakened little still clips belt firmly
 

I bought case 6 months ago Nokia 8260
 I pleased case protect phone several drops fit phone well
 All holes right places, etc
 My complaint stems facts 4 months, spring clip holds phone belt began loose ability keep phone secure
 It fell belt several times seated
 The chief complaint material hides actual spring metal clip started unravel seam left metal exposed
 This due wear placing phone belt
 

I bought case one reason
 And reason protect phone
 Yea, sure worked 2 months, MAYBE
 Then that, I looked phone make call screen cracked
 And WITH case on
 The reason I gave two stars instead one fit tightly around phone I able get guickly I needed emergency
 So, don't care won't protect phone, go ahead get it, otherwise, don't get case
 

One aspects Nokia 8260 I really enjoy size, I like phone case fits tightly around phone provides good protection, without bulky leather seems flaps
 The price steep, comparable simmilar leather cases
 

A little piece vinyl $20

 Forget it
 I returned it
Women can't easily use anyway unless pocket wear belt
 The little flap made fit belt keep handy
 Otherwise end putting purse everything else
If made belt sling shoulder better, around waist, something similar, I might get it
 

This phone cover amazing 
 I bought Nokia 8260 fits perfect
 I got dark blue matches phone pretty well
 The cover looks like withstand pretty well

 The case fits Nokia 8260 perfectly, without stretch make fit
 Handy belt clip stays tight around purse strap, jeans pocket, waistband
 Also liked also protected screen mars scratches
 Great deal

I swapped Motorola MPx200 (which I fried) Nokia 3300 initially low price compared phones similar features
 You get lot &quot;bang buck&quot; phone
The selling point 3300 music player
 It plays MP3 files &quot;raw&quot; (not MPEG-4 encoded) AAC files
 Because support MPEG-4 compression, you're better using MP3, raw AAC files bitrate acutally larger size noticeable difference quality
 The music player among best I've listened (it actually BASS output) provided stereo headset; also listen single-ear (mono) earpiece player knows difference switches stereo mono accordingly
 You also listen either music player FM radio using loudspeaker phone, listen FM radio still keep headset connected, utilizes headset wire FM antenna
 I encountered issue music player arbitrarily change tracks, FM radio spontaneously kick another station preset, could accidental keypresses case I phone in
This phone also includes recorder special audio cable (3
5mm standard plug ends) connecting external CD player equipment record MMC card (64MB) supplied phone
 The phone records 64Kbps, 32KHz &quot;raw&quot; AAC format (64MB = 2 hours audio), fine recording radio voice greatest flawless quality preference CDs
 The Nokia Audio Manager 3
1 software supplied phone clunky stalls frequently; I highly recommend using RealPlayer 10 Nokia Mobile Device plug-in (which also handles conversion MP3 you); RealOne Player plug-in also included CD comes phone
 If separate MMC reader, read cards rather phone speed transfers
The phone decent quality phone, Nokia handsets
 However, don't want look like space alien talking it, you'll find using earpiece almost always (otherwise, hold narrow back side phone face talk; looks tacky feels awkward)
 The full keyboard US &quot;B&quot; model excellent text messaging e-mail--*IF* light see (only call, hang-up, directional buttons light up, means can't see numbers keyboard dark--major issue communicate less-than-ideal lighting; keep little mini flashlight you)
The 3300 supports Java MIDP 1
0, wonderful
 Most apps I used frequently MPx200 I found suitable Java alternatives (MyCast Weather, Virca IRC client, EmailViewer e-mail client, MapQuest Mobile real-time directions among apps I use often)
 The built-in e-mail client adequate, forces download entire messages instead headers see *really* want read (downloading full messages consume GPRS bandwidth hurry e-mail box big), I use ReqWireless E-Mail viewer, doesn't disadvantage
Like Series 40 Nokias, Calendar basic limited capability, Contacts database robust
 Which brings another major issue phone: lack PC Suite support
 The data cable supplied phone interfaces MMC card phone phone's interface itself, need synchronize via cable use cell phone modem, you'll SOL device
 It supports synchronization over-the-air using SyncML SyncML-compliant server (again, bandwidth hog contacts/calendar db huge); Nexthaus make SyncML server sync Outlook, calendar items supported 3300 get skipped calendar always incomplete (Contacts come great though)
Lastly, would think phone supporting MMC card format would also support SecureDigital (SD)
 It not, MMC cards becoming increasingly difficult find vendors make move SD cards
 The phone comes 64MB card, sufficient people, like hour's worth MP3s, you'll want look 128MB 256MB MMC card
 I give much: feature backup restore phone's settings to/from MMC card, smart feature use case phone accidentally reset
Overall, I enjoy phone, especially awesome music player java support
 

Got mine October '03
 Loved features
 Great price rebate
Pros:1) Full keyboard - aids text input beats regular number pad hands down
2) MP3 player - Can use MP3 files ring tones, store songs memory card
 Way cool
3) Speaker - good speaker phone listening music headphones aren't handy
4) Games - need kill time, games nice have
5) Internet access - decent net access, didn't use much, though
6) Menu - fairly intuitive easy use
7) FM radio - another way pass time enjoyably
8) Voice capture - good making quick verbal notes
Cons:1) Non-backlit keypad - impossible use dialing night, especially combined with


2) Small buttons - dialing buttons larger
 Easy misdial, especially night
3) Center 4-way menu button - press scroll menus
 Must bad contact button
 Extremely aggravating
4) Poor speaker volume - even shrillest ring tones don't penetrate normal winter coat I'm wearing it
 Lost many calls I never old phone
 Hard hear music speaker normal din quietest areas
5) Lost audio calls - Often, call would ring in, I would see caller-id, I picked up, I couldn't hear person
 Called back person, said I could heard fine
 Only happened incoming calls
6) Poor earpiece design - angle earpiece case makes hard position flush ear opening
 Poor volume means cover entire ear opening get clean sound
7) Proprietary SD memory - If take battery, pop 64mb memory card, unit won't take inexpensive standard SD cards, like 256mb 512mb card
 Why? Nokia requires special thin SD card selling
 Bah
Conclusion: It's nice toy waste away idle hours blissful fun
 You could run mini cable headphone jack set powered computer speakers nice MP3 system
 But doesn't cut phone
 I need superior phone, rest icing cake
 Thought I could 3300
 Nope
I'm getting Motorola V300
 It's outstanding phone
 Tiny
 Features-a-plenty, rebates cover entire phone even pay $51 bought Amazon T-Mobile
Avoid AT&T; Wireless
 One month calling 3300, live customer service email responses whatsoever
 Shame AT&T;
 

This phone worked well me
 The sound clear reception fantastic
 The sound music pretty good supplied headphones microphone/headset crystal clear
 I lucky trying find case accessories phone
 The accessories seem available mostly came phone
 I found case fits right date
The music software seems work well
 And recording capability phone also pretty good
 I like full keypad entering contact info
 It lot easier cell phones
One final note - I wish phone disabling option order music player phone could used airplane
If you're looking phone little different, offers little standard phone easy program add contact info to, great phone
 

I chose 3300 (despite slightly childish look) I thought phone/music/PIM combination would give functions I wanted one machine without going expensive smartphone territory
 But it's incredible disappointment, several reasons:1
 The music player supposedly play AAC files well MP3, it's different protocol AAC used iTunes
 If want copy tracks ripped CDs using iTunes' default setting, you'll convert MP3 first
2
 It can't sync directly PC--no Nokia PC Suite available model (nor be, I told customer service)
 Apparently, alternative entering phonebook/calendar entries hand MightyPhone, 3rd-party web-based service costs extra $3/month
3
 The Nokia Audio Manager software terrible
 It couldn't complete single track transfer phone, froze solid minute trying
 I wound copying tracks directly drive, strange things happened track list, I edit NAM
4
 The earbuds stereo headset big women--I simply could steadily place right-side one ear, fell whenever I walked
 (The way stop hold microphone 


 isn't point headsets free hands?
?) And since headset jack proprietary, can't substitute headphones
I suppose might OK kid wants cool-looking phone decent sound
 But depend PIM functions, I think you'll disappointed
 I'm exchanging Nokia 3650, PC Suite, Bluetooth, ability download applications (including MP3 players)
 

I like full keyboard good contacts, notes text messaging
 I also love radio/MP3 player
 I take gym touch use phone ear plug radio


better walkman
 All GSM features plus cool music/keyboard makes great phone
I wish letters/numbers backlit problem keyboard lose ability map letters back numbers IVR responses (like, &quot;please spell last name person calling


&quot;) 

I bought phone via e-bay (uh

) cool phone take everywhere 
 Nick Mp3 player , Cool radio 
 great txt msg 
 thing I don't like keypad light upif memorize QWERTY keyboard (which I have) ok , oh also number keys little small 
good phone though
Nathaniel Newman 

Reading reviews, I agree Nokia Audio Manager best software world
 I can't get reorganize tracks, unless keep pressing buttons keep screen phone lit up, freeze computer trying load songs it
That said, I giving phone 4 stars?Cause I like sound quality, features, customization ability, basics phone
 Once songs uploaded, music player easy enough use, use normal bud earphones listen think, like I do, enclosed headset appears rather fragile
The stereo quality nice music, I've problems heard even busy city street enclosed microphone headset, fit fine
 It also bells whistles including ring tones mp3 files, I think speakerphone quite loud
 You cover speaker holes located lower back phone
And also depends cellphone life
 I'm casual user, I like fine
 

o gosh BEST PHONE EVER







 The mp3 player great radio (great signal)
 soo easy text message full keypad
 calls clear easy handle
 also phone tank, ive dropped dont know many times still works great little scratches
 would definately recommend buying phone ive almost year absolutely looovve 

I bought phone within first couple days, I wanted return it
Pros: The features nice, games loaded memory radio/MP3 player, I love
 The phone small portable
 The keyboard great writing email text messaging
Cons: The dialpad small make phone calls (especially entering pin numbers voice mail) practical
 I'm use using thumb dial; I pull phone away use hands (one steady phone push right button)
 Don't think enter contacts memory won't use dial pad
 You voicemail
I sold phone got Nokia N-Gage
 

When I decided buy first phone I wanted get best one I could buy
 Looks capabilities key factor deciding one
 I get samsung cingular try sell nokias better reception
 I picked 3300 mp3 player, radio, cool design, I saw alicia keys used one one music videos
 I since January ir hasn't failed yet
 One thing I would change would sell holsters cingular interchangable plates
 Other I highly recommend it
 Put want something really small don't get it
 

On plus side: I've problems ripping / downloading songs it's great text messaging
 It's got SIM-card I think different (and better than) US phones
On side: 1) keys aren't backlit can't use dark
 2) earphones horrible: they're heavy, don't clip, bizarrely long ear wires, can't &quot;coiled up&quot; use (so mine always tangled)
 They're impossible use jogging
 They come disconnected phone leave pocket
 Finally, mic sits belt level, always see people holding &quot;hands free microphone&quot; want heard
 It's hard imagine company could make cool phone &amp; horrible mic/headphones
In short: Fine train, active usage
 

I 3300 bought 50and thats good deal service too




 If CArd reader fine cable connects computer fine MUSIC



 IT COMES WITH 64MB











its much enough



 radio buy headset costs $$10 JUST TEN DOLLARS alright


PHONE $50HEADSET $10total $60 

I thought, like previous reviewers, would *the* phone integration features I looking for
But, already noted, falls short:* come PC Suite synch* keypad backlit proved frustrating I would thought* unfortunately, 64MB isn't quite enough (128 would much better) use MP3 player* headset keeps disconnecting I put phone pocketWhat I've really enjoyed (and certainly phones well):* keyboard key using phone organizer I found easy get used to* headset helps making calls noisy environments--both ears participating* voice tags reliable--hold button headset say contact's name (or tell phone start mp3 player, e
g
) voila, happens


Haven't recognize voice tag
As extra long cords mic hanging real low--the secret (and NOT obvious me) open oblong plastic piece mic ear buds re-close behind neck


It brings mic be, takes weight ear buds allows take ear buds ears hang conveniently close want put back in
 It actually works well
 

I tried 3 weeks get service Nokia 3300 phone
 AT&amp;T Amazon kept pointing fingers other, finally Amazon told send phone back, order new one
 I sent phone back w/out ordering new one (one time shame you, two times shame me), I'M PRAYING THAT I ACTUALLY GET MY MONEY BACK
 The phone seems pretty nice especially price, alas good true
 I may go AT&amp;T store I get face face service instant activation
 

This phone fell short expectations
Cons:Speakerphone loudRadio gets horrible receptionButtons complicated (esp text message)NOT RECOMMENDED text driving (what time
lol)Buttons dont light upNo AIMNo CameraEarpiece big much hassle carryRadio work w/out earpiece64MB enuf mp3's
Earpiece keeps coming off
PROS:its nokiareception pretty goodI recommend nokia 6610
 menu set radio LOUDER speakerphone smaller
 Depends user
 I picky customer phone sucks
 My friend warned fell trap
 

When I first purchased phone, great
 AT&amp;T provided good service house (which practically dead zone) perfect
 Then I wanted add M-Mode (an AT&amp;T internet feature) HELLO, tell I phone 45 minutes waiting live operator (thank goodness 611 free, otherwise it'd eat minutes
)
 My phone calls keep getting dropped someone tries call me; takes 3 phone calls actually establish secure phone call w/out dropped
 For shame AT&amp;T
 If rumours true &amp; AT&amp;T merge Cingular, they'd better kick a** a** switching Verizon provide real service Nextel (where actually get customer service rep
 less 3 minutes -- sometimes less 2 mins)
If it's show &amp; tell, yea get phone, it's serious use, stick have, it's probably better anyways
 As speakerphone feature, music plays great, sometimes it's loud enough even car hear (don't drive &amp; keep cellphone ear, get tickets NY state way)
 The mp3 &amp; FM radio features rock you're taking bus school something pass time, keeps getting bored
Conclusion: If phone offered real provider like Verizon, it'd worth cos you'd get great service &amp; great phone show use
 The phone handy features
 Look NOKIA 6225 w/VGA Camera installed coming soon, probably best phone that'll quite while
 Good luck


 

Save money look phone that's easier use one
 I initially liked phone odd shape exciting features, I regret purchase altogether
 I Cingular, service pretty good
 That's problem, I realized Nokia second Motorola comes quality
 I like FM radio &amp; MP3 features, come massive flaws
 You can't play radio without headsets phone bulky annoying
 I love listening radio cell, too, look phone radio hands-free headsets
 If Nokia improve phone re-release like weak music cd's, would better market
 THE WORST PROBLEM I HAVE keypad
 I love keypad, I hate it
 Full QWERTY keypad light even glow dark
 Don't even think you'll memorize keys won't trust me
 False advertising Express Cases
 Nokia said would void warranty I change cases
So, ladies gentlemen, don't end like me


 I two years left contract I hate phone
 I get lot looks it


 knew much I wished I 


 Motorola V600


 

The phone great AT&amp;T worst cell phone provider ever
 There network many dead spots funny small ones either
 I got better signal roaming ever get at&amp;t big disapointment
 

























































































The price cheap holder sturdy secures phone well
 The think I don't like plastic part covers "on" button Nokia phone I pinch finger start phone 
 
 
 doesn't take lot effort, bit inconvenient
 

I've using 5 days week it's held well
 Works advertised it's flimsy like cheaper clips
 Easy get phone time answer calls
 No complaints here
 

Item I expected
 Needs improvement design, ended throwing away
 Would buy 

I PURCHASED THIS RATCHETING BELT HOLSTER FOR MY BOYFRIEND
 HE WAS ALWAYS HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING TO HIS PHONE WITH THE OLD CASE HE HAD
 HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS CASE AS IT GIVES HIM EASY ACCESS TO HIS PHONE
 HE ALSO LOVES THAT THE RATCHET ALLOWS HIM TO HAVE THE PHONE EITHER HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL ON HIS BELT
 

It works great I needed
 If want protection, get something else
 


This holder hold Nokia 6800 securely all
 I would buy it
 

Over period three months, phone fell hit ground 4 times, swivel joint finally broke, resulting phone almost tumbling storm sewer
 

astrological sign


because force buy things clearly need wireless phone, like HOLSTER, seperately (because Goddess forbid include packaging cell itsef)
 But, yeah, holster Nokia 6800, functions fine
 







This holder actually sturdy I like position phone vertically horizontally ratcheting swivel
 The reason it's 5/5 doesn't offer much protection screen 


 expected candy-bar style phone
For person trouble getting phone holster; apply little bit pressure base phone middle finger pushing top flap thumb
 (hard describe, I seem able get phone instantly
 

I haven't found many aftermarket holsters cases 6600 product well constructed allows full use phone, camera charging devices without removing holster
 

The phone clip decent
 The phone didn's "snap" like I used phones belt clips
 Other that, good belt clip
 

This holder feels solid sturdy customized phone, u actually use features phone clip still on
 You position phone vertically horizontally ratcheting swivel without fear slip fall
Only thing is, doesn't offer protection screen
 I takes bit practise order learn quickly release phone clip using
 While clip attached ur belt, place, apply little bit pressure base phone middle finger pushing top flap thumb
 Try times, u'll surely feel ease process
 Overall, good product
 

The clip perfect holding 6600 without fear slip fall
 But unlike holsters I've used, it's impossiple slip phone conversation
 You unclip holster belt use phone still attached
 Because holster grasps phone securely using indentations two sides phone, need hands pry free
 Secure yes, easy use, NO
 

I love clip
 It fits onto cell phone perfectly hole camera lens back
 The lens protected belt clip, swivel side whenever you're taking pictures
 Theres hole back speaker opening inputs bottom phone
 Your 6600/6620 almost never fall connected belt
 I HIGHLY recommend clip
 
































































































































The form factor makes real convenient carry around
It's got functionality I need phone
I use 1GB microSD card listen MP3s commuting
The web browser nice feature enabling pan within web page, also get minitiarised view going back/fwd cached pages
WiFi would nice, mobile network GPRS fast enough me, finally
The criticism I phone font small mom, I would got one well
 

I really like e50 - it's definitely one favorite purchases last year
 I couple issues: occasional lock up, battery life could better (but I'll blame Bluetooth), everyonce reception really bad reason places great (i
e
 everyone else signal me)
I use primarily Cingular network, worked fine mother's t-mobile SIM I visiting
 Network switching really seamless
 Bluetooth connectivity works great Nokia software


 I sync laptop getting within feet
 I don't use headset I'm borg
The speakerphone really good loud, noise cancellation little poor
 When I'm late work driving conference call, boss tell - girlfriend's cheapy Samsung much better that
 But, I'm able get exchange account gmail, I installed Opera browser (pretty fast GPRS browsing)
No real games speak of, that's I console PC home
 Acrobat works great, pocket office utilitarian, I even extract zip attachments
Some people think it's boring looking, coworkers like simple silver color
 I don't look like 15 year old whipping neon blue RAZR I use meeting something - that's nice
 Looks weren't major concern choosing phone next 2 years life
I really don't use camera mp3 player much, work
 When I need capture 'no freaking way' moment, camera definitely pretty decent, even night flash
 I able take clear pictures 2am Times Square problem all
 They would probably even printable 4x6
 I imagine would meet people's needs, I honestly say won't shooting video thing
 It's pretty awful
All all, I'm glad I didn't go crackberry
 I like candybar form factor I'm weird computer guy doesn't actually like 18 gadgets strapped thigh, forearm, belt
 I'm better old fashioned two thumb typing 12-key big fat qwerty's
 Plus, I could still get email crackberries went dead last month
 RIM overrated
If anything, I'd say functionality potential power people (including myself) really use day day basis
 If type person knows proper use word "lego" context (you know are), definitely NOT buy this
 You disappointed
Probably favorite feature (I know sound dumb) center joystick - it's super easy use navigating menus cursor Opera, flashes green miss call
 

I looking phone compatible local area Cingular (850mhz)
 It's slim compare smartphones
 Excellent software provided phone, I read MS Word, Excel even pdf files
 Internet connection average speed "EDGE" mode
 Don't expect much camera (1
3mp) since selling point phone
 For $200 less E65, would highly recommend need WIFI, functions same
 








































































My mobile phone needs simple
 I already camera iPod, I don't need whizbang device snap photos, play music, entertain games
 I need something makes receives calls SMS
 I've using Nokia 1110i year now, pleased like mobile
 From Russian swamps Sahara Desert, survived dropped (repeatedly), crushed heavy baggage, rained on, baked sun frozen minus temperature
 It still works well day I bought it
 Thanks part limited screen lack extraneous features, goes almost two weeks battery recharge
 






















I calling back Nokia 1100 Phone
 The Nokia 1100 Phone good phone
 I understand longer available
 something good always available
 When phone upgraded to: 1) Add reminders, 20 instead 10
 2)Make written rthe keys last long; numbers, letters, etc
 3)Add Speakwerphone feature
 

This phone one I rely phone does


 make calls retrieve voice mail
 I got Nokia 1100 refurbished form I signed Tracfone
 The battery life awesome, phone sturdy well made, flashlight alarm clock come handy
 I love phone
 Oh, I addicted little Snake game
 But phone isn't extras, it's phone calls
 I go looong time without recharge it, too
 

Pros: Sounds goodAlarm clockFlashlight useful, though awfully bright
Good calculatorOK gamesLong battery life (so long restarting constantly
)OK signal, though drop calls mall occasionallyCons:Horrible customer serviceTends restart, several hours, even charging
Randomly turns offCrappy ringtonesOverall: Some nice features, pretty basic unreliable
 




















This says case fits BlackBerry Pearl 8100
 It not, case way big
 The phone floats around case
 

This case NOT cellet original picture shows says (which I give 3 stars) case made good quality price, don't expect last week due price it'll last while, like years while
 I bought case Motorola SLVR L7 didn't seem perfect fit
 Any phones size this, don't buy it


 Look better one
 The case fits longer phone little bit wider too
 But spacious really want it
 Overall, great Motorola might 

Just never got item seller
 This probably proper place put comment seller, Amazon provided
 

I bought thing Motorola SLVR doesn't fit
 The thing could hold 2 inside
 I actually went swap meet bought leaver case Mexican guy fits like glove cost $6
 

THIS ITEM WAS ADVERATISED FOR A BLACKBERRY 801, THAT'S THE REASON I PURCHASED BUT IT IS TOO BIG
 IF I HAD KNOWN I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT




 BAD ADVERTISING
 

It advertized fits Nokia 8801, way big, beware product
 

really like case, yes perfect fit knew got


this multi phone case may fit perfect either instead bad review buy different one



now want replacment case great price get one



 would buy another one needed, seems well made job, protects phone


 

Great product price


 well constructed, good leather leather lining


 something luxury feel it
 I like lot, especially considering low price

This first bluetooth headset, I bought price design
 Both still good reasons, piece fits ear (like headphones) slip sometimes, especially I'm wearing sunglasses
 I've experienced fantastic sound quality, it's charge held much longer I expected
 I've never anyone ask I headset, tells great microphone too
 Overall, I satisfied headset, especially matches white phone
 

There's one perfectly good reason buy product -- Nokia irresponsibly refuses carry spare parts
 If lose rubber earbud, throw entire product garbage, don't carry spares, one makes them
 DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT Nokia product poorly designed one
 

good: light, easy use
the bad: volume control, low volume (even max volume setting)the ugly: white??? can't come black least dark color


 

I ordered item looks hard find Bluetooth compatible new cell phone
 When came, I found easy use quite comfortable
 After talking friends family, said sound quality great didn't realize I using Bluetooth Headset
 I would recommend anyone looking something easy operate
 There one downfall, charge goes faster I expected
 If going trip sure bring charger along, I forgot
 But come find out, uses charger Nokia cell phone, plus
 




















































































































Nokia N91 great phone people love music always go
 The dialing features great superb quality music
 You put lot songs enjoy videos real flash player
 The dialing features great specially voice activated dialing
 Texting also nice could better little bigger keypad
 The lacks LED flash would served purpose taking good pictures night along 2 megapixel camera, even though take great daytime pics
 Overall weight phone reasonable looks manly
 However know ladies would like phone becoz weight lookswise fascinating
 Connection great even areas low signal reception
 Overall would rate phone nice looking phone advanced features would certainly attract people slide steel keypad cover
 I many compliments phone happy it
 

love it



love it



love it


 nothing bad say phone


it's got everything need looks really cool
 




Seems good quality works advertised
 No complaints product delivery
 






Sorry say, I replaced product 4 times
 Within three month period tiny wires get shorts audio gone
 I disappointed sturdiness handsfree ear phone
 Would recommend product
 


Very functional
 Perfect fit phone
 Access holes right spots
 Belt clip solid good spring tension
 Phone clip connection solid, positive, "SNAP" place
 You know phone locked worry coming off
 Exactly I looking for
 Highly recommended
 


























































it doesn`t work all, I bought different retailer (same model) working fine
 Better check origin cable


 

No matter hard tried cable didnt work
 So gave time
 Its coupe years realized could review 

But then, I've never successful getting Nokia cable software work
 Guess I trade phones I'll transfer everything manually
 What pain
 

The product cheap knockoff, worked fine me
 Does everything it's supposed do, problems
 




















Within two weeks using phone case clear plastic cover near stud/button clips body case, allows wearer remove phone case, developed tear
 This tear rapidly grew made case unusable
 I might add malfunction occurred wearing case office environment
I since bought Covertec leather phone case similar value superior quality Krusell
 

This product one see picture
 If get item able get pc without pushing phone case
 Forget getting help SF Planet make hard return items
 Do buy unless want use telephone computer
 

I bought case work phone; I work industrial environment case sees alot serious use
 It's solid case, works good protecting phone abrasion
 Its nearly three months case beginning come apart
 I don't really blame quality case seen much abuse
 I'll likely get another one finally unusable
 


































Utilic&eacute; esta bater&iacute;a en mi viejo celular por poco m&aacute;s de un a&ntilde;o antes de migrar de tecnolog&iacute;a celular y hasta esa fecha todav&iacute;a funcionaba


 excelente bateria


 


This phone one I rely phone does


 make calls retrieve voice mail
 The battery life awesome, phone sturdy well made, flashlight alarm clock come handy
 I love phone
 Oh, I addicted little Snake game
 But phone isn't extras, it's phone calls
 I go looong time without recharge it, too
 

I still Nokia 1100b (circa 2006) use backup prepaid phone it's extremely durable reliable compared&#65279; app filled fragile iPhone
 While Nokia never dropped call bad coverage area, iPhone routinely drops calls coverage like swiss cheese
 Excellent battery performance even many years use, need phone "just works", old school phone one have
 That said, I'm rarely using Nokia except backup - playing Snake fun quite enough
 











I bought cell phone protector friend phone getting scratched
The price really nice compared Nokia store
Plus tight fit doesnt cover screen speakers like cell phone covers
 













































































I ordered Krusell Cabriolet case Nokia E61 smartphone
 However, cut-outs fit buttons phone exactly, described product description
 I tried several times adjust case accommodate power button joy stick phone, avail
 I also see cut-outs completely straight -- cause problem
 

The item looks nice, useable
 The plastic cover screen, covers joystic area moves much
 The phone slides case way leather OFF button, phone turns without knowing it
 Don't buy, something better
 You end using anyways
 

I Krusell cases great one fit phone well
 I gave couple weeks hoping leather would strech help
 They still best belt clip system
 

Poorly designed
 No cover screen seems hit power button turn phone regular basis
 

The Leather real good strap keep phone case I start using case last night came self five different time made right
 

I've phone month now
 I didn't like looks I saw it, I went t-mobile store tested it's pretty good want music player/cell phone combo
Music speaker pretty loud
 Drains battery like crazy, people would probably use headphones anyway
 This phone comes headphones decent
 You use headphones, phone also comes adapter, hiss background
 It's noticeable quiet parts songs, I wouldn't say it's much big deal
 It's like white noise, I stick ones came with
 Using headphones comes make background hissing sound
 This player play songs randomly, you're listening random songs like music players
 Uploading songs easy, drag drop
 It records listened songs, favorites, etc
 I haven't used play list feature, it's nice option have
 It also equalizer improve whatever style music listen (and make difference)
 Buttons easily accessible music playing
 A bit hard press, that's better accidentally pushing pocket something
As phone, I'd say I preference Samsung Nokia maybe that's I'm 100% love phone (more like 99%)
 The voice quality pretty good, BUT bad thing you're noisy environment (it picks lot background noise)
 Sometimes phone gets really static-y sound quality poorly, that's less frequent thing
 I don't like one alarm (no multiple alarms like Samsung has), that's big thing
 The speaker phone option handy, buttons outside phone great easy access
OH
 And headphones work handsfee set, listening music talking friend minute later want
Now bad


 This phone doesn't feel durable all
 It's made plastic slider slides easily
 Seems like small amount pressure screen crack it, I wouldn't recommend people don't take care phones
The best thing I say phone comes free 1GB space songs, making better mp3 players price AND better music players, period
 It's good music player, especially price, it's decent phone
 Nothing fancy it's phone qualities, ask me, gets job done
 It's real quality music player part it, I can't stress enough
 Also, good sites download fun wallpapers, themes, etc
 Check --> http://gallery

com/c/nokia-5300-themes/1/ 

I got phone becuase I eligible upgrade sick tired Razor I think entirely rated
 This phone gives every thing I ever need phone more
 I can't get many features phone has, I use everything
 

I recommend phone ANYBODY
 I absolutely love it
 I three months problem far
 The music player great, I swear


the camera looks ALOT better 1
3 mega pixel
 The handset wonderful, headset included it
 If buy phone, WILL last long time
But yeah

so far, problems whatsoever
 I love it
 [

] 

Update:If memory card bumped, easy touches inside battery cover, phone gives picture, ringer, theme settings stored program again
 The way make sure settings lost store phone, limited space
The good stuff great, bad stuff horrible
Great:======The loudspeaker amazing
 It good bass phone really cear, long doesn't get overloaded
The display also amazing
 240x320 resolution display detailed pictures, overall quality really good
 Colors bright streaks dark areas
The included memory card 1 gigabyte
 Loads videos songs
I like number keypad menu keys
 They large enough fingers, easy push, yet click feel
 Even though phone slider format, number pad keys slightly raised profile feel individual keys
 The menu buttons also raised areas click without looking
Awful:======The music player bad could be, reason saving playlists seem work
 When I select list play it, phone starts playing tracks aren't it
The buttons side phone (Volume, play controls, camera) feel cheap, requiring good amount pressure still squishy feel
 They feel like going break pressed, play button phone actually broken right box
There adjustment brightness contrast
 The display looks great, actually bright want view websites videos low light
 Since full-time device, theory used play music hours, might also handy brightness could turned save battery power
 Too bad
The lowest volume setting viewing videos almost loud maximum volume small Ericsson
 It annoy people distance, won't get lower
The WAP browser basic POS 6030
 Sometimes text squished single-character column
 Sometimes displays text color background
 Every time page loads, goes blank comes back again
 It looks like page loaded ready scroll, pops back top again
 The high speed data rate large display useless web browsing software can't anything
The standby clock, even screen saver, really small can't adjusted
The software plain buggy
 The phone crashed briefly viewing web page, somehow caused theme graphics (but all) revert defaults
 There also menu option change text color standby screen, doesn't work
 It always goes back black changing it, I can't use dark wallpaper images I want see menu key labels
With extremes good bad, I wasn't sure final rating phone deserved
 I decided lower rating great quality loudspeaker, display, data speed don't provide much benefit negative aspects accounted for
 

Nokia 5300 third phone till now, I crazy phones, I give importance basic functionality phone rather features, I never used phone apart Nokia phones
 In phones battery life used simply awesome, phone I really disappointed battery life, I need charge every day
 Overall phone good
 complains
 

After old trustworthy motorola pebble decided pack went Nokia 5300 much partially impressed rather one better phones offer part phone contract
In several months I broken several times
 The screen decided take image stained glass window, phone ugly little fat thing sits uncomfortably pocket probably half decent functions phone half decent camera
While phone tried sell built MP3 player radio option personally even I didn't ipod I would rather spend 50 half decent MP3 player phone sturdy, slimline well, functions phone
Cant say anything really recommend phone
 2 stars kind
 If put new version pebble
 

I like phone
 It easy use good size me
 I like fact use mp3's use ring tones instead buy : )Battery life great minor draw back
 I find hanging people accidentally sometimes slider sensitive shoulder ear
Overall I think best phone I date
 

I purchased phone replace land line disappointed
 I haven't used functions yet (downloading music), haven't problems anything else
 Here pros cons:Pros1-Colorful/Clear Display2-Good Volume (ringer volume loud enough I hear callers fine)3-Easy Menu NavigationCons1-No shortcut get main menu (have keep pressing "back" button)2-Battery access (it's really hard take casing get battery SIM card-could good thing though)3-On/Off Button (it's small-basically use fingernail)
** Update-3/22/08 **I've phone year I haven't problems
 I've dropped many times it's always worked fine afterwards
 Short battery life drawback
 

Great phone
 Just beware screen; you'll get scratches within 24 hours unless handle phone gloves
 Buy screen protector




 

I recieved phone today [


] disappoint didnt come everything claim suppose come like usb cable cord, headsets,etc
 All got phone, charger,maual fine
 Hopefully hope problems phone phone nice far like wish came everything said would looking forward putting music phone got wait later that
 

I got phone awhile back replaced fast kept freezing I'd take battery restart it
 My phone recently broke I'm back using one realizes I avoided first place
Picture Messaging - never works, always says network failureText Messaging - doesnt seem save new words quite annoying type frequently used word recognizeCalls - good
 problems here
Overall - sometimes phone freezes option switch doesnt allow choose it
 

I know others complaints phone's dependability, I've phone couple months still works great love features has
 At first, worried USB cord connection work Mac, since bluetooth, still able send receive files computer phones bluetooth
 The battery life works great also really don't charge much
 This best phone far purchased
 Uh, well, sort purchased
 

Have used 8 months
 My thoughts (trying avoid repetitive reviewers):Pros:1
 Good price--especially now, rebates2
 Great QVGA screen3
 Decent set features/applications4
 Good MP3 player -- good sound quality5
 Intuitive interface/menusCons:1
 Cheap build-quality (wobbly slider, doesn't feel sophisticated, feels like toy, even compared older phones RAZR) -- there're much better sliders there2
 Reception -- tested low-reception areas (the new RAZR2 Sony Ericsson phones managed get close full-bars, 5300 gets 1 bar

)3
 Battery life -- you'll need recharge every day even light/mimimal use (not much problem particular phone, seems Nokia phones suffer short battery life)
4
 Supposed quadband phone, somehow T-mobile turned triband
 Also features/application removed due T-mobile's firmware
To sum up, okay entry-level phone, worth free
 If like Nokia XpressMusic series, consider newer Nokia 5610 5310
 If must get phone T-mobile, check RAZR2 v8 instead
 

I like phone looks menu easy enough it
 It works I guess that's plus well? This first phone I everyone I talk problem hearing me
 Apparently gets ton background noise
 I cannot really rely phone important/business phone calls
 I'm thinking going back old freebie Nokia candy bar phone now
Bottom line: keep looking
 

It's bad music phone dedicated music keys, it's stylish ones there
 I would say it's great younger generation would rather take meeting
 I ended returning T mobile coverage area
 I probably wouldn't buy even current provider it


 

Just let anyone interested phone


the back cover covered warranty T-mobile
 So, happen lose break it, T-mobile send everything else (the phone itself, charger, etc), without back cover
 Don't ask don't cover it--I thought pretty weird b/c without back cover, phone nothing
 The battery fall off
 Also, manufacturer doesn't carry either so, thank goodness ebay
 My phone functional again
 The guy Nokia I talked said I called first (the manufacturer)to repair it, b/c replace everything, check first anyways sending stuff them
The phone good though, I wish little bit slimmer
 T-mobile customer service questionable though
 

I phone close year now
 I traded Razr phone I told better signal it's motorola counterpart
 Not Razr product lot offer
The complaint I speaker doesn't work properly results missing calls able use speakerphone
Aside that, phone awesome
 

I received Nokia 5300 days ago
 One thing I found voice recorder could record one minute
 It looks like can, talking Nokia twice phone, recording minute available phone
 Didn't make sense choose miniSD card put voice recordings on, able record minute
 Plus, record talking phone - one minute
Everything else phone great
 I highly recommend reading pro's cons reviewers
 I Microsoft Vista laptop worked great - wondering work Vista
 

This best phone ever made
 It worst phone ever made
It average nearly every regard
 My faults phone are:The slide mechanism isn't smooth
It's triband: 1900/850/1800 means next useless lot places outside country
Favorite features:1gb memory standard
 This highest memory sold major carrier phone released
Easy music camera controls
 

I bought phone week back Amazon
 I eagerly waiting get it
 Finally I got couple days back phone amazing
 It great looking phone
 It compact comfortable hold hand
 I don't think I need carry mp3 player anymore
 Infact loud speaker phone added plus compare mp3 player
It seems battery life moderate compare phones, I used phone hours yesterday consumed 20% charge
The phone many features price tag -50$ else I ask ? 2yrs contract, thats fine phone without contract days
 

I phone days now
 It good phone overall
 However, seems nokia could gone extra mile make phone much better
 Most people love it, however drawbacks might make terribly frustating some
Some pros cons -Pros -1
 Good reception/phone quality
 Typical nokia
 No problems here2
 Intuitive phone user interface
 Again typical Nokia UI
 This one nokia 'S40' interface
 Phone responsive, sluggishness found earlier nokia models
3
 Good build quality
 Slider robust smooth (No loose hinges)
 Buttons flat found sliders, thus misdialing usually occur
 External 'music' buttons easily felt fingers phone inside pocket, hard enough prevent unintentional pressing
4
 Clear bright display
5
 Nice assortment supported bluetooth profiles
 Has stereo bluetooth (a2dp)
6
 Comes 1GB card
7
 Music quality good (however noise issues may experienced - see 'cons')8
 Phone comes adapter use regular 3
5mm headphones
9
 External speaker loud, clear phone
Cons -1
 Music interface highly frustating
 Very difficult make custom playlist phone
 If want combine different songs playlist (on phone), way I found add different songs 'favorites'
 Then open 'favorites' list save playlist
 Even song order may lost
 Each song favorites list deleted new playlist made
2
 Music synced PC using 'yahoo jukebox' nokia PC suite software
 Yahoo jukebox joke, confusing use
 'Nokia PC suite' better option, may come across occasional bugs software
 You also simply drag music 'music' folder memory card, cannot create playlists computer way
 Mac users last option put music phone, cannot 'sync' music upload it
3
 When headphone adapter used (for standard 3
5 mm jack), slight definite background noise (a slight hissing) creeps in
 This provided earphones used (which plug directly 2
5mm jack)
 And though music playback quality excellent, adapter far perfect
 The provided headphones functional stock earbuds
 Audiophiles may like options either case
 I exchanged adapter store days see adapter problem, noise still remained
 I shall get phone exchanged see unit problem
 Note - inline microphone cannot used 3
5mm adapter
4
 If using phone provided headset, pull headset pin "slowly" (to switch talking phone directly), call sometimes disconnects
 Somehow pull headset jack clean swift motion, pin grazes inner leads causing call disconnect
 I realized problem calls disconnected whenever tried pull jack using one hand
 I went back store pulled headset pin 'slowly' every phone display
 Sure enough, almost every call disconnected
 Even t-mobile floor rep surprised see this, lodged trouble case t-mobile
If careful take pin swiftly, never happens
5
 Battery life disappointing
 The phone battery older Nokia phones
 However large display, bluetooth music playback, talktime suffers greatly
 Some users might find using bluetooth longer periods save battery charge
 You cannot afford forget charging phone night
6
 Voice dialing joke phone
 You cannot save voice tag
 A text speech algorithm tries match voice address book entries fails miserably
 It guaranteed misdial almost every time
Other thoughts - Camera 1
3 MP, nothing good bad it
 You find better worse cameras phones
Mac users buy isync plugin [


] full featured phonebook calender sync bluetooth
EDIT - My friend bought 5300 phone problem background hiss 3
5mm headphone adapter
 So, phones
 

I purchased Nokia 5300 Black T-Mobile store
 It come 1 GB memory card I able easily load 160 songs last night problems
 Phone comes USB cable connect computer
 I Mac easy do
 You able download songs bought iTunes load AAC files mp3 mp4
 You hold 500 songs 3
5 minutes long compressed 128 kps
 My music usually remixed and/or longer 3
5 minutes each
I wasn't able sync Bluetooth iBook I able pair Motorola T305 I using car
 Apple approved Nokia 5300 yet sync
 I sure matter time since phone rather new
Overall, I love feel phone, wonderful 2 screen, color great, camera cool, intuitive use
I Samsung last three years I concerned going back Nokia
 However, speakerphone absolutely great compared Motorola 195 I originally got returned
Once load songs, speaker impressive
 This morning, I phone playing music one part house, I go get something end house, I could still hear music perfectly
Calling phone better expected
 I talking friend busy traffic lots people/background noise I able carry pleasant conversation unlike Samsung difficult with
The phone quite sturdy
 And I happy phone everyone - Motorola Razor
 This Nokia 5300 looks bit chucky compared phone I feel like I unique phone phone
Who needs iPod mini get phone one?I ordered Boxwave Frost Case phone
 There little chose T-Mobile store far accessories Nokia
com didn't much either
*****The alarm feature wake cool too
 You choose wake favorite song downloaded program slowly increase volume song alarm
 It also comes programmable snooze
 What dream
*****You make calls without even slide phone dial
 As long number want already stored phone book, look press green button
*****When playing music, incoming call comes in, stop playing song alert normal ring tone call coming in
 Once done phone call, resume playing music
*****As I said, phone gem areas - speaker, sturdy, colorful, I think contemporary acquired taste sure nonetheless appealing, call quality great even loud areas, lots little creature comforts
Definitely consider phone really like music bluetooth speakerphone
 Else, may phone you
 

I purchased phone four days ago impressed part
 The first thing you'll notice crisp clear screen is
 This slider phone, thankfully things without sliding screen expose number keys
 The things I think thus far requires expose keys dial new number that's contacts text message
Next, go features
 So got 1
3MP camera, camcorder, music player, 1GB microSD card, bluetooth support, infrared port

and *drumroll please* FM radio
 Now, FM radio isn't satellite based, cannot pick radio stations across U
S
, stations local you
Now I go good bad things feature:1
 Camera - Impressive picture quality
 Yes it's 1
3MP compared 8MP digital cameras, show camera phone does? 5/52
 Camcorder - Not impressive
 While recording, quality seems perfect
 However, play it, turns bit distorted
 Plus, allows 20 seconds recording time regardless size microSD card
 3/53
 Music Player - Impressive
 The speaker good quality, loud
 However, I still could find way change order songs without making playlist
 There's play, pause, next song, previous song, fast forward, rewind features buttons shown pictures
 The buttons must pressed fairly hard, music won't start playing spontaneously pocket
 Also, I blown away quality music improves put stock earbuds
 4/54
 FM Radio - I bet phone tried use radio stopped short told buy enhancement
 Well, truth don't need buy anything extra
 Just plug earbuds came phone, serve 'antenna' allow hear stations
 And since need earbuds hear radio, yes sound go earbuds
 However, there's 'loudspeaker' option allows radio played external speaker, still need keep earbuds plugged in, serves 'antenna'
 This means want hear radio phone, NEED earbuds you
 You may need play around position phone antenna (or may move) order get clear reception
 3/5Misc
 Info:Only two games included, trials
 (Lumines, Texas Hold'em)You can't transfer games another phone
 You must pay download again
You can't delete pre-created profiles (those come phone)
 You create own
In order change phone vibrate, must make vibrating profile
 Then use it, takes several steps, hard, inconvenient
The interface shows month date, day week
Only two face templates included phone
That's now
Overall: 4/5 

Confidently walked intothe store buy pre-shopped/selected titanium slider; walked one, I never seen didn't initially love looks of
Why? I know you're thinking
 How strange
Answer: More phone money, great reception xcellent service
First things first: It's sexy slim thing; it's fashionably small, bit chunky marshmallow white it's black
 Not fiercely slick first glance
But want phone?Looks function?This I loved immediately: The slider smoothly satisfying, display crazy, colorfully nice, keyboard well laid out/lit good feedback, interface completely toss-the-manual-in-the-corner, takes pix video great zoom storage generous - 1 gig transflash pre-installed, thank much
 (Oh, replace included stereo headset bluetooth one like
 Or use audiophile earbuds included jack adaptor
 Choices
 Ever looked proprietary jack top titanium slider? Ew
) In words, it's really friendly phone many levels
 If you've ever used Razr, know end usability scale
Then someone store let hear MP3 player earphones
 I heard beautiful jazz
Crisp
 Clear
 Sweet
 Penetrating bass
 Ahh
That -seriously- good sound
It also sounds pretty darn good external speaker
At home I discovered that, I'd hoped, loading simple dragging dropping (MP3/WMV/AAC) files
 Which be
 Do I need phone frustrate me? No
Now phone: Simple use
 Have dropped call since I switched phone, calls go straight voicemail either (grrrr
) So phone do, too
 Refreshing
Texting/MMS-ing pleasure instead torture phone, doesn't seem limit many phone store
 (Whew
) Who knew?IM'ing also simple, buy message bundle fire thing up
Pictures video (with sound banging zoom) look fine; quality bit better million effects (that I would never inflict anyone
)The phone customizable T, including different MP3 ringers choosing allllll friends (and frenimies too
 And cut length bitrate
)Finally, called customer service new-customer questions times 



 never waited minutes reach live person
 They always helpful, I felt like business truly appreciated
 This sharp contrast previous carrier, sounds like "swindler" me
 Now
Naturally, nothing without issues/limitations phone obviously different
 I would remiss I mention following
 If need best show phone, keep moving 'cause ain't - idiosyncratic appeal grows you
 And don't bet rent voice dialing - you'll lose
 (But really, calling that?
)Note need loud earpiece/speakerphone volume, phone
 It's adequate; it's bullhorn
 And it's likely you'll charge baby every night, depending course use
 Screen uses juice
So that's I know Nokia 5300, phone I'd never heard that, lucky me, suits needs
 Give look
Who knows? It might you, 



 

I don't need text, Nokia 5300Xpress really great phone price
 My cell phone mainly used phone calls; phone, I enjoy using cam music player
The screen really clear large compared phones I've had
 The pic shows screen brilliant colors higher resolution phones even though camera lens 1
3 mega pixels (most cam phones market 1
3 mp)
 The great thing screen phone fill entire large screen pic without borders
 Most phones smaller screens less colors/resolution
The music options much better previous phones
 You add music CD collection hard-drive via computer portable memory microSD--a really tiny--card (1 GB microSD comes free phone)
 You play music continuously without press play button song want (which I previous phone)
 You also play songs random repeatedly
 It equalizer play music via stereo headset (which comes phone) via nice loud speaker
You control volume, put high, gets pretty loud
 The great thing go phone menu play music
 There independent buttons sides phone play/stop music control volume easy access (similar MP3 Player)
 Another feature takes notch FM Radio phone reception comes clearly
 The headset comes phone could nicer, it's bad free
 Only issue previous Jasbra 2
5mm headset I bought use Motorola v710 didn't fit phone
Another great thing music phone become ringtone without pay extra favorite ringtones
 One weakness ringtone combo ringtone mode vibrate ring (which previous phone conveniently had)
 This phone vibrate ring, both
It took little figure enter contacts phone, I figured (after reading manual), it's pretty easy add people's names numbers
 The good thing name added, don't retype name number
 You five numbers (general, mobile, home, work & fax) per name
Other features find phones, you'll find one: time, photo & video galleries, games (comes Lumines Puzzle Fusion & World Poker), cam, video recorder/player, voice-recorder, IM, messaging, alarm clock, calendar, to-do list, notes, calculator, counter/timer stopwatch
This nice looking phone, it's slider
 I normally like flip-phones, particular slder phone really attracted attention
 It's light; perfect weight doesn't feel flimsy
 Try get plastic cover clips right phone, protect phone scratches
 The sales guy gave nice clear one, makes look even better
 Also, local shops offer one year contracts ask
Nokia 5300Xpress great phone price even though people always say could better
 I've seen many worst phones, one great I look phone
 I don't need Blackberry, best one get now
 Go shops check phone, I'm sure you'll like you're music wants basic phone
 It's better iPod far I'm concerned phone well MP3 capability
Oh one last thing, people claim battery life doesn't last long, I think it's pretty decent compared phones
 On standby, 5300Xpress lasted four days (which previous phone lasted 1
5 days)
 If listen music continuously phone, lasts three four hours, quite long tiny little phone
 Hope helps
Brief Update: I've phone half year now, it's still great
 No scratches clear clip-on cover
 The music player, FM radio phone working well
 The battery life getting shorter, I think that's understandable
 On standby, lasts 3
5 days now
 People complain signal problems really complaining T-Mobile, doesn't greatest signals available, that's phone's problem
 If want excellent signals, go Verizon
 If want phones use internationally, go T-Mobile phones (Verizon phones great states can't used countries)
 This phone worked really well I traveled outside U
S
 

I picked phone replace aging Motorola v620, I must say, Nokia knows make good phone
 True, it's weak areas, notably battery life
 It feel little flimsy screen greater tendency scratch
 As someone large hands, I don't find issues cleanly hitting buttons
Pros:* Memory expandable 2GB (comes 1GB, lot things considered)
* EXTREMELY customizable
 No fuss muss download factory software add everything music, photos, videos even themes
 Yes, themes

 (I'm surprised one mentioned yet many Websites offer free theme, game application downloads theme editor sort floating around net)
* Those familiar Motorola "modding" know pain access modify phone via computer due buggy highly proprietary software
 Not phone, mention don't pay extra cable software
* Great audio quality
* Camera/video good many options
* Standardized USB connection
* I could go on, sake time I'll leave reviews fill gaps
Cons:* Battery life suck pretty bad
* Somewhat flimsy feel it
* Internal phone memory great
* Screen prone scratching protected
* Transferring USB little sluggish
 Renaming files device takes longer one would expect to
* Ear piece speaker opening small needs slight realignment ear order hear clearly
All-in-all, great phone, beats heck practically Motorola phones I've owned used (Even Razr)
 Nokia hasn't let yet
 I highly recommend phone
 

This basically beta-phone, worth anyone's hard-earned cash
 Nokia give away free, get customer feedback, produce something decent
Encouraged positive feedback given others Nokia's reputation (I one phones years ago, switched back forth Motorala Samsung while), forewarned cons others noted, I got one replace Motorola Pebl
It's great it's slider phone feels good hand
 It's great T-Mobile's network gets poorer reception Pebl
 It annoying quirks keep exploring more
 It doesn't reset (at least, mine doesn't) I used submenus, voicemail like
 So, delete message example pressing "7," "7" stays screen matter long don't use phone afterwards, press "Clear" times
 And press "clear" many times, starts loading T-zones last thing I want I exited voice mail
When bring SIM card-loaded contact list over, know every name entry spelled (Motorola let multiple entries name long info, like phone email address, different), randomly deleted phone book
The camera hard activate, sometimes I press button four times instead usual two
 The "off" button illogically placed top phone I always forget turn darn thing off
 I returned phone within money-back period, form slider factor made hesitate long
 Fortunately, I didn't spend lot money it
 

I bought motorola rizr z3 ( cute phone, poor reception, frustrating)
 I ended exchanging nokia 5300 back awesome reception nokia has
 It less features( per games, backdrops ringtones


not biggie, always download) bit clunkier, gives great piece mind
 There doesnt seem nice carrying case customized phone


will try fosmon crystal clear


Music great clear
 So far good


 complaints
 

I got chance play one last week
 The external speaker loud, controls easy use best all, comes 1GB card
 My gripe slide feels little loose; I felt like I always going open mistake
 All killer phone MP3 capability/software lot better KRZR
 

I got phone two days ago really excited it
 The mp3 player pretty good quality right phone pretty cool all
 However, day phone minimal use (a phone calls, listened maybe 2 3 songs) phone dead
 The battery life way short think i'm going go back t-mobile exchange something different
 

I think worst Nokia phone I ever had
 It doesn't seem like it's Nokia quality me
 I would get Samsung slider I could again
 Battery life subpar, slider seems cheap breakable, speakerphone loud enough
 The interface pretty smooth, that's it
 If simple interface, might work, otherwise I'd get Samsung
 

For price, phone fantastic
 It comes everything need, more
 The best foremost feature course music player
 The sound quality great included headphones, although also comes adapter use headphones choice
 The headphones also function headset hands-free talking
 The speakers also best I've ever heard phone
 It comes 1 GB memory card immediately throw songs onto start enjoying music collection
Some people voiced concern music player unable make customized playlists
 It's true can't phone, download Nokia PC Suite software website create custom playlists computer
 This program also offers easy way transfer data like pictures video phone
 All need USB cable included
With fabulous new songs threw onto phone, make customized ring tones
 That's right, mp3 assigned ring tone individual contacts, matter length
 There's need spend 2 dollars downloading T-mobile store
It's also extremely customizable
 You assign functions almost button
 This really handy getting rid annoying "t-zones" assignment comes with, officially "Phonebook" button
 The camera also pretty decent throw customized wallpaper assign pictures contacts
 Beware camera long delay clicking taking picture, almost never turn way think, usually blurry moving subjects
The downside phone battery life
 If you're using music player, you'll need charge day
 And can't charged via USB you'll lug around wall charger
 When I limit music listening time less hour day I get go two days recharging, still abysmal compared old Nokia would go week
 Also, beware screen scratchable
 I managed get three deep scratches phone first week using it
 I recommend buying sort screen protector display bright beautiful don't want muck easily preventable scratches
Overall, I highly recommend it
 Aside screen protector possibly bluetooth, you'll need buy nothing else get phone full functionality
 Compared phones force purchase USB cables, headsets, adaptors, memory cards, steal
 

I love


with phone
 I know sounds absurd, it's true
 Originally, I suggested friend upgrade handset getting one; seeing I already done Motorola V3T
Ironically displeased 2 different Motorola's V3T RAZR handsets (both freeze startup), I called customer service told 'em I wanted handset instead
 With minor contract extension/handset upgrade, I glad I made switch NOKIA
 I've 24 hours I'm totally satisfied it
 Below list "pro's con's" consider:Pros:- Bright visible LCD screen
- MP3-ringtones enabled (make sure cut tracks 25 seconds so)
- Video ringers
- Pretty fast charge, even messing around it
- Bluetooth infrared-enabled making quick file transfers
- Dialing keypad raised easy input
- Date enabled screen (which V3T lacks)
- Comes "headphone jack adapter" enables use standard headphone may have
Cons:- Vibrate functionality disabled handset charges (by default)
- Power button somewhat small difficult execute
- FM radio plays static (this may varies area)
As see, pro's outweight con's one, give try
 Also, decide it's you, return T-Mobile within 14 business days purchase get full refund
 As me, I won't returning it's definitely keeper
 :) 

I Bought product based C-net review gave highest rating
 From start phone felt extremely cheap
 I also terrible time trying get phone sync Mac
 Nobody Nokia seems realize alternative platforms there
 I spend ten bucks third party program, I could get isync work 5300
 I finally returned I found next gen version 5300 better every way
 When I t-mobile return phone, Mic 5300 stopped working
 I'm glad I able return time
 

many phones (5 exact) breaking within year getting them, decided go nokia heard durable
 Well heard correct
 Ive dropped multiple times, gotten kinds car grease, motor oil, etc it, came right off
 thick small
 Fits nice hand
 The bottons also better slider ever had
 arent flat, instead stick bit easy press
 nice operating system, good callendar, programable soft keys directional keys, great screen, etc
 Its loud, customizable, set song ring tone, message tone, etc
 put upwards 100 songs it
 give altogether 4
8 5 

This phone horrible reception t-mobile
 The thing I like music player
 I use gym volume great it's easy use, sucks try using talk
 I could hear person line saying hello repeatedly I screamed hear now?

 I've read reviews people said reception great day I got phone wasn't
 

After spending 5 minutes trying get back (don't know defective not), I noticed I one bar signal (where I normally 3-4)
 That first sign I going problems
 I finally removed back put battery in
 The menu user friendly, much get one place
 I able receive messaging (which I subscribed to) upon transerring card everything went haywire
 After phone waiting tech support, I able finally use phone
 Not happy reception
 The phone small lightweight that's good
 I'm going back Treo 5300 going back Tmobile
 

We bought phone 3 weeks back phone died 15th day arrival
 When got new phone mp3 player features really excited
 Right day 1, phone created interesting problem transferring mp3 files computer made computer crash times
 I trying hard transfer file computer dint work I gave (desperately)
 I put phone charge went bed phone wouldnt switch next day morning
 My husband country I literally stranded without phone
 The basic feature expected phone reliability disappointing well known company like Nokia produce phone low quality
 We used Motorola phone past 3 years never problem
 

I bought phone even week ago I love phone's features 
 
 
 making/receiving calls, volume horrible
 I boyfriend lives Hawaii I couldn't hear thing saying volume low
 It wasn't even phone calls
 After going T-mobile store, checking Nokia's, I noticed volume phones one I'm assuming it's Nokia thing
Also, slider seems bit flimsy
 I wish would made metal plastic comes rather cheap
I'm giving 3 main point phone make/receive calls can't hear, that's big problem
I exchanging Samsung T629
 

I bought phone three months ago problems recently
 I noticed scratch it, turned crack, became bigger
 The screen still visible next day
 It became black could see anything
 I would recommend phone anybody
 

I got phone cause I thought would nice little phone
 Wrong
 Yes plays songs
 Yes little
 Too little



 This phone made someone med large fingers
 The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK
 It hard use
 I returned phone 2 DAYS
 I got Samsung T629
 TOTALLY better
 Does almost everything Nokia does, better, looks better performs much better
 If teenager phone may good you
 The Samsung even sounds better
 Get Samsung, price phone
 






































































































































































































































































































































































































This perfect fit phone
 We looked everywhere brick mortar stores, eventually came back Amazon product
 Why not
 

could find product anywhere decided come Amazon alway searching good deal case time - Amazon much cheaper price found retailers online
 geniune Nokia product

 can't beat that
 shipping fast always
 works beautifully
 

Have TracFone couple weeks now
 Set-up internet problem receive extra minutes so
 Find phone bit heavy side bulky
 Does fit pocket well unless wearing jacket
 Battery charge last 250 hours stand-by Nokia book states should
 Get 48 digital area
Potential buyers may warned TracFone &quot;piggy-backs&quot; different carriers across US
 My local carrier Verizon Digital
 The Nokia Phone features voice mail indicator text messaging work service area
 As I purchased phone free land line job hunting, voice mail indicator important me
 Have missed calls feature
 Had call outsourced customer service India many times finally admitted text messaging voice mail indication offered Verizon area
 If like using outsourced customer service reps, still problems, ask customer service number Miami
 I wish would truthful customers services offered various carriers
One last thing, beware unused pre-paid units refundable
 

I received new Tracfone Christmas gift husband
 We attempted activate phone 10 days
 We used internet site, down
 We tried phone contact, heavy traffic, involved long wait
 We kept waiting
 Email contact netted standard computer reply 4 days initial inquiry directing us use company website
 We continued call call 800 number
 We finally reached someone 5 days supposedly phone activated
 It didn't activate properly
 Again contacted customer service told phone &quot;used&quot;
 Next received shuffle around various managers
 They finally stated would need reactivate wait another 24-48 hours
 We'd also eat 6 days service stated contract would one year initial phone contact even though we've service
 Don't waste time money
 We're trying return phone (didn't get use it), although buy prepaid card, nonrefundable
 Our lesson learned, prepaid services may provide phone stick service
 

My husband I Tracfones one year
 It perfect plan us, neither us enjoys talking phone much desire another monthly bill
 The Tracfone ideal long promise won't use make &quot;So, I'm aisle Wal-Mart 


 doing?&quot; calls
My complaints live customer service AWFUL, fortunately pretty much everything website, voicemail feature impossible figure out
 

The phone good, appears sturdy enough, basic features, Tracfone prepaid service leaves much desired
 For starters, nearly impossible get touch live person, need speak someone customer service issue
 Emails usually returned within 24-48 hours, sometimes don't even address original question
 My biggest beef minutes deducted
 When traveling one's local area, sometimes validation code must entered order &quot;prove&quot; you're say are
 Tracfone deducts minutes time, even though cellular company announcement says &quot;this free call
&quot; So let's say NYC area, want make call 


 must first validated (once per 12-24 hours), knocks 2-4 units (1-2 minute call, roaming mode), THEN get make call
 And reason get &quot;Your call cannot placed&quot; message? Forget -- minutes GONE
 Keep things mind, using emergency phone
 I left walking past weekend's blizzard Long Island, searching payphone, Tracfone wouldn't come me
 I'll continue use local area, cell phone use check messages make important calls, I'll make mistake depending traveling
 

We bought two Trac phones kids
 Between horrible features phone well expensive cards
 If that's enough, buy minutes try install either calling Trac Phone web site, doesn't work takes week get minutes phone
 They don't even try happy
 They miserable deal with
 Don't waste time money
 Tracphone worth time aggravation activation
 

The phone nice good features
 I bought son Christmas
 He happy told friends
 Well end Jan
 phone still activated
 I called 4 times
 Customer service sucks
 I think new english well
 And one guy trying explain phone won't work without singal, like I stupid
 He told 3 times
 I got mad I give phone husband I started say things would helped
 I gave 4th call
 I finally told cancell whole thing
 My son liked son ended flip phone verizon
 And I end paying more
 Stupid tracphone company
 

Terrible customer service; misinformed service reps (I told I would able transfer existing Tracfone nubmer upgrafed Tracfone, wasn't true)
 Trying get refund next impossible
 As someone used TracFone, I say absolute certainty worth it
 Learn mistakes go reliable pre-paid service AT&amp;T, Cingular, Virgin, etc
 Avoid TracFone unless want sub-standard service, false promises, crappy phones
 

I used Tracfone service three years
 I went prepaid I use monthly minutes previous cell phone plan
 I wasting money every month
 I use phone call check children short phone calls probably less 20 min month
 I would recommend prepaid use phone makes lots calls, price per minute costly, use wireless ocassionally, prepaid way go
 From comparisons I've made appears Tracfone cheapest per minute rates
I problems Nokia 5180i find pretty simple phone use
 The reception good coverage acceptable well
I use website renewing minutes pretty straightforward
 There long wait times need speak customer service always worked problem long wait
 

I live rural area concerned I wouldn't get good reception
 So 30-day money back ($ restocking) major buying point
 I trouble shipping buying direct Tracfone ship Fedex SIGN
 REQ
, absolutely redirect, home address only
 Activated online (some instructions confusing [some menu shortcuts phone don't act like instructions read])
 Phone active immediately (despite say might 24-48 hrs
) got friend referral extra 100 minutes trouble adding them, got "FCC number allocation" error website
 Called Customer Service, got person spoke broken english seemed cell phone, courteous took care problem quickly
 I've gotten several errors website
-Great Phone/Service-Affordable occasional/emergency use-Good, understandable terms - hidden fees-Customer Service website need improvement 

I specifically bought Nokia phone Tracfone service emergency use
 The reception extremely clear, except I WAY sticks
 I use outgoing calls, probably 10-20 minutes per month, costs $ month
 It would poor choice someone chats away uses cell phone substitute land-line phone, it's great cheapskate (like me) wants security phone instantly available emergencies
I never trouble others reported service, I've never call customer service, either
 I buy cards, activate online, away I go
I recommend buying accessories Nokia/Tracfone online, however
 They made error order, I pay priority mail ship erroneous item back them
 

I Nokia 1100 Tracfone saves quite bit money monthly contracts used Cingular cellphone service
 Tracfones ideal people light medium cellphone usage, works well me
 The tracfone website user friendly makes easy perform functions activation, information gathering, additional purchases
 


 

customers say, tracfone way go use phone needed activities chat
 nokia good phone, think
 one cheap, stays charged 1 1 1/2 wks
 camera motorola charged every day
 also, got could make calls receive them
 problems nokia, don't even anymore
 also, call customer service, deal guidelines, etc
 ask question something besides exact thing calling it, ignore you
 it's like read written front something
 also, hard understand
 minutes transferred motorola nokia today, could barely understand woman talked to
 get nokia, buy minutes online, b e ok
 

This second cell phone I ever got(both first & second bulky phones Nokia service Tracfone)
The phone worked fine
 Back day size right
 I liked amount "monophonic" rings built phone
Tracfone's service ok
 Only people use cell phones sparingly
 Otherwise cost prepaid high
Good phone back day

oh way, I know phone old; Amazon "date first available" set July 7, 1977
 Whoa
 Maybe Dan Tana could've used instead car phone
 

My tracfone good reception
 like free call waiting free caller id
 haven't activated tracfone yet 'refer friend program' give us 120 free minutes
 please send email send fast referral( check email often)
 it's win/win
 thank you
 

This pretty good phone price
 I take mine anytime I leave home emergencies, etc
 It also comes real handy power goes 


 hills PA, that's fairly often
 I hardly need make calls minutes go far, I add 40 minutes every 60 days I'm good go
 It may lack fancier features like vibrating alert serves purpose
 I would highly recommend phone "safety net"
 





We found come soooo handy
We spend ALOT time online & found necessary cellphone others call us we're online
Our kids love Tracfone & us parents peice mind 'cause always stay touch
From Text Messaging,Caller ID & more(depending favorit Tracfone)


this phone serves purpose 100x over
 

i'm happy tracfone far
 decide get tracfone, please let refer activating it- get 100 free minutes
 thank 

When I went line activate new Nokia Tracfone, web site informed - based zip code, I certainly know
 - I lived different city I imagined
 It kept &quot;correcting&quot; address demanding I confirm error, would let proceed activation unless I this
So I called 800 customer service line, although meant giving bonus minutes line activation (and I really, really like things line whenever possible, anyway)
 I found talking pleasant young woman whose foreign accent pronounced lot trouble understanding other
 She best help me, eventually informed phone defective
I actually relieved
 Back goes
 And I'm get conventional cell phone carrier local office
 

This phone easy use good people using 50 minutes less per month
 I keep phone active $ month
If want longer battery life slightly smaller, motorola(more expensive) also good choice
 I don't agree others tracfone website customer service
 I little trouble activated purchased phones,added time referred customers site
 


 

tracfone great company anyone looking get contract free cellphone
 buy minute cards anwhere service good even kids
 would highly recommend service anyone especially kids
 new digital service get free caller id voicemail, many wireless service dont have
 


 

Don't waste time money
I purchased phone husband along 60 minutes via TracFone's web site
 We received phone time promised 60 minutes phone card 3 weeks late
 It took us 4 calls Customer Service (which I may add poster child bad customer service be
) activate phone time called wore told wait 24 48 hours
 About 2 months activating phone purchased additional air time local store
 We activated line minute balance go however renewal date change
 We assumed would change expiration day wore 4 weeks ahead due date
 On expiration date phone stopped working
 Customer Service use hard understand
 We wore forced purchase additional air time forgo minutes "expired" phone
 The last time phone expired BEFORE due date I enough decided get monthly payment cell phone husband averages payment paid one TracFone
 

The phone little heavy, works well
 I would keep phone weren't lousy Tracfone service
 Tracfone charged two times insurance I authorized first charge
 I spent couple hours trying resolve I give up
 Customer service non existent
 

My husband I used tracfones year happy
 They use largest phone company's network best coverage(always good signal)
 It costs $ month
 We cancelled $ sprint plan enjoy savings
 


 Their customer service OK website works fine
I don't really understand others complaints, knows expecting
 Tracfone light users, maybe 50 100 minutes month
 

Buying easy trying get activated nightmare
 I bought two phones one wouldn't activate good area I in
 The customer service absolutely terrible I could hardly understand anyone

what nightmare
 I sent back hopes refund way know nothing customer service department knows I ever get done
 My advice this


If must buy one dont I buy reconditioned used unless friend know got service it
 I sick contracts I still looking try next
 I might try using smoke signals experience I &quot;Tracfone&quot; put even trying again
 Heres hoping I get refund alright dont call again
 US Cellular pits too


The phone I doesn't even work home refuse replace unless I renew contract expensive contract
 Everyone make buck

sick it
 Whatever happened good old fashioned &quot;The customer always right?&quot; I may quit cell phone altogether
 

I used Tracfone service several months now, I complaints
 I problems adding minutes, phone worked everywhere I tried it
 Why I pay $ $ per month traditional cell phone plan TracFone I need $ per month? The Nokia simple, no-frills, rugged phone perfect keep glove box emergencies occasional use
 I like mine
 

My tracfone worked good far
 Customer service fine free voicemail easy set use
 If decide get tracfone, please email quick referral activating it- get 120 free minutes 'refer friend' program
 I'll also send simple instructions follow
 I've used Tracfone quite while, able answer questions might have
ps even activated last weeks able get us free minutes

The Tracfone Nokia 5180 good choice want simple use, inexpesive phone
 I find tracfone's customer service improving website good enough needs
 That said


if want phone occasional emergency use don't want pay $+ month, better choice
 I keep mine active around $ month
 


 

I recently bought activated Nokia 5180i TracFone far happy & "TracFone"
I bought phone 'One Year' agreement didn't receive info get phone show 60 days
 I Wrote first web support people quickly sent 1-800 # call
 Customer support first class people I dealt with
 They professional & friendly walked thru problem quickly efficiently
 I couple occasions call write always received excellent service
 Too bad 24/7 I nite owl
This service ideal backup purposes limited calling



 

Tracfone, company based Mexico, shaky best
 After almost year trying out, we're finally throwing towel giving another pay-as-you-go company (Virgin Mobile) try
 At least phones Virgin Mobile aren't models 5 years ago
 But problem(s) we've Tracfone, aside trying communicate phone reps hardly speak English, unorganization, bad tech suppport, product quality itself
 Half time got charged double minutes phone supposedly area 'roaming mode,' actually wasn't
 It took months send simple battery charger replace defective one
 Finally last straw wife's phone suddenly went inactive - couldn't make calls whatsoever
 When I called find why, could give explanation, said would reactivate start new phone number (this would third new number her)
 Bye-bye Tracfone - hasn't fun
 



This second LPS-4 Loopset I own
 The connector broke 2 years use several phones last one
 I able understand people better also able block people talking around me
 Anyone use hearing aids listen can't go wrong
 I listening music T-coils hearing aids switch telephone without problem
 I lost without till I received new one
 

I using Nokia phones since 1999 I got first Nokia came loop
 My cousin got birthday
 I heaven I could first hear it
 It takes little getting used "digital" voice, achievable
The old loops seemed break times year, LPS-4 lasted 2 years
 The great thing longer use batteies power loop
 The power comes phone
 Great savings there

 I 90% loss, hearing pretty severe & I able hear familiar voices pretty well (not perfect, enough hold conversation)
 Ive tried Hatis & also hearing aid compatible phones & nothing matches Nokia
 Did know man invented loopset Nokia hearing impaired himself? He one also made LPS-4 run phone power & batteries
 Here product invented individual uses product & understands
Cindy IL 

Like others say, INDISPENSIBLE item life
 I never leave home without it
 Its like wearing headphones, TOO COOL
 They tend break/wear two years, factor in, that, super reliable
 I use Widex Divas great setup me
 

Now I understand every word person phone saying
 My hands free things
 The volume control adjusted different situations
 It saved business
 The Nokia Loopset lightweight comfortable, works great
 The competitor's loopset much heavier, didn't work well, technical problems even I sent back repair
 Anyone hearing loss Nokia loopset
 I love thing
 

If depend digital hearing aids full time hearing, Nokia cell phone loudspeaker function, absolutely must loopset easy comfortable conversations
 It largely noise-free, speech comprehension (in case) quite clear, ability powered directly cell phone makes functionally far superior older loopset, requires three E-675 batteries whose endurance limited
 A nice touch, although used me, ability plug audio devices loopset (watch added cellphone battery drain)
 One advantage: hands free telephoning made possible
 

























































































































Our tween daughter loves new cell phone
 The music sounds great easy load plus software required computer


much convenient old music phone (unlocked Motorola V3i iTunes)
 For cell phone, photos good taken outdoor don't need use flash
 Photos flash haven't turned well 


 far seem like much flash 


 washed out
 The phone feels right taking photos 


 like using camera cell phone take photo
 Video ok captures good sound (we didn't remember bring camcorder use phone record kids' orchestra concert sitting balcony far away orchestra)
 

really like phone, camera great music player even better 























































































































































































































































I purchased headset complement Nokia 6230 mobile phone
 It necessary (or previous version headset) enable FM radio feature 6230
 It features wide Nokia connector needed connect phone (there mini submini style plug 6230)
The headset features snap allow "wear" headset around neck
 You dangle earpieces use ready access needed
The headset dual function - works listening FM radio MP3 music phone (who needs iPod Shuffle?) well telephone conversations
 The microphone works quite well standard mobile environments
 There pushbutton cord switch radio presets, switch MP3 player next song, allows hang call - depending mode operating phone in
The white color somewhat similar Apple's iPod headphones
 The earpieces give good sound reproduction adequate volume
 They bit large, aren't comfortable long term wearing unless using supplied foam earpads, black color may last indefinitely easily lost
 Nokia offers "Sport" version headset would better fit joggers
The cord used good quality coating seems resist tight knotting - definite bonus
All - comfortable wear, definitely gets job done quite durable
 

I love design idea headset
 You wear around neck earpieces hand time
 The problem earpieces worst I've used
 They completely uncomfortable keep falling out, it's due cord thick
 In terms quality it's great headset though, basically waste money since bothers much
 If headset designed custom fit eargels like Jabra headsets, would excellent
 

I disappointed product
 The earphones large uncomfortable
 The wires heavy bend oddly protective hard cloth around them, presumably make durable
 And I speak someone I sound like I far away, makes sense receiver falls belly button
 I never use headset
 It waste $12
 
































































































































































product perfect, arrived 3 days I use nokia 6030so listen radio feature work out
 

Works well type phone
 However, I wish earphones comfortable fit
 

This headset works great Nokia telephone
 The sound awesome whether using one earpieces
 I could find one eletronics retail stores fit telephone older model
 I would purchase product again
 

Hello, receive days ago i'm canada parent came back florida
 So try plug nokia phone pin connect little bit tall
 I think 2-3 mm pin phone dont ear anything pull little bit i'm able ear
 It's hard find right head set phone
 I buy almorst 5 different kind doesn't working
 

I bought Nokia 2610
 The headset performed I expecting, giving freedom handsfree time cheap have
 I surely recommend Nokia handsets, bluetooth them
 

SITE LISTED THAT MY PHONE WOULD BE ELIGABLE BUT IT WAS NOTTT

HORRIBLE SERVICE AND CLIENT

LIED AND DECIEVIED TO CUSTOMERS
 DO NOT ORDER FROM HIM












 


































































My Nokia phone extreme proprietary connection headsets
 With I mean, two specific models manufactured Nokia work
 I know
 I tried
 So course, overprice two
 Fortunately, I found one half price, kind headset, works perfectly good
 The service fast
 The price great
 

This I need able use phones fm radio
 problems ordering billing
 

good sound price
 best sound nokia headsets I all
 Only flaw earbud wire short collar rope constantly pull ears
 






















I couldn't believe it's true
 I skeptical ridiculous low price offered battery
 To amazing surprise, battery bit bit good better original Nokia battery phone came with
 I can't find better words describe satisfaction battery
 I recommend anyone every one replace batteries type
 





































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































This geat looking phone case

 It great fit made durable
 I feel it's best looking one there
 I teenager also liked much, bought one herself
 I always liked Bodyglove products, I love quality
 I feel also adds class faceplates
 

This phone case have
 I ordered three colors myself, I'm satisfied purchase
 The cases fit perfectly
 The openings bottom perfectly designed allow connect charger headphone
 Removing replacing case difficult reviewers commented - you've figured best way so
 Which makes using phone desktop car charger unit problem
 The case design allows easy use phone buttons - including top Power ON/OFF Button
 The design stylish overall tailoring fabric quality/durability top notch
 Overall, excellent product met expectations
 I recommend buying one color like I did
 ;) 

got ,it looks nice fits phone fine
 

This case stylish intutitive
 It protects keys( smudge marks) durable
 You can't go wrong &quot;BODY GLOVE&quot; products
 The reason I gave product 4 5 , phone sometime difficult get out
 

The material good versatile leather
 Looks good casual business attire
 The phone fits perfectly still looks good
 There chance phone falling case
 It also protects face well
 However covers volume button side
 But I still easily adjust volume material
 Also open bottom flap charge
 Which simple enough, would easier hole cut it
 There hole headset, though
 The clip belt pocket perfect
 Good product
 But don't get case unless intend use clip
 Unless don't ming button sticking back (which holds belt-clip)
 

The case looks great provides good protection phone
 The belt clip works great
 The fit good, except holes don't line well 8260 Series phone (presumably 8200 Series phones)
 If 8260, don't get case; get Body Glove case made specifically 8260
 I made mistake thinking 8200 Series phones created equal, not


 

This looks sharp feels sharp good person go
 The Swivel clip smaller secure well
 The main thing I found wrong accessory holes
 No hole plug hands free hole power misaligned, one hole Volume control
 

cover almost expected
 nokia 8290 work civil engineering(tough environment); fits tightly perfect
 So tight hole IR broke little; although phone manage twist little inside cover makes holes going alingment specialy one IR Ringbell
 But sure protect phone investment best possible way falling, kicking, bumping, etc; thanks it's neoprene cushion
 also waterproof
 clip easy goin' nice hold, fast release
 worth every penny
 































































































































I bought Nokia HS-4W Boom HeadsetThis Nokia Headset horrific
I use Nokia 6230The headset disconnects/loses connection phone time phone rings I answer phone since ear piece won't respondVoice recognition works I touch key cell phone
It lowers volume phone automatically half respond
Sometimes even produces horrific noise
In conclusion DO NOT BUY product
 

gift brother soprised opened it, uses time works fine nice audio quality good price shipping time
 

Esta es la primera vez que tengo contacto con un "manos libres bluetooth", es facinante la sensaci&oacute;n que te da, el poder hablar por varios minutos sin tener la molestia de un cable o el peligro de quedarte con una contractura muscular en el cuello
 El aparato en s&iacute; es genial, te da una conectividad de aproximadamente 10 metros, el sonido es nitido, la resistencia es adecuada (ya se ha ca&iacute;do un par de veces), la bateria tiene una duraci&oacute;n aceptable
 Los &uacute;nicos problemas son: 1
 despues de una hora, se te hace pesado el aparato (me imagino que eso pasa con todos los aparatos) 2
los primeros d&iacute;as te da una sensaci&oacute;n de mareo (que puede ser circunstancial) 3
 cuando te lo pones, parece un auricular de sordo (pero imagino que en el futuro, habr&aacute;n esos que se noten)
 Por lo dem&aacute;s lo recomiendo como un "must have"
 

It stylish, one piece design, lay flat pocket, bluetooth headset
I've using Bluetooth headset 4 years now; Motorola OK short talk standby time
 Sony Ericsson pretty good, sturdy
 Jabra charger loose connector problem
 Nokia? So far, good
Mind you, bluetooth headset provides paired connection cell phone, rest performed phone; phone voice dialing, use voice dialing, make sure enabled phone
 Once enabled, button headset acts call/hang button phone
My Sony Ericsson S700i re-dial voice command, Nokia headset send 2 beeps phone perform function, bad
One good thing headset connect nearest previously paired phone without re-pairing like headset
 That good 2 phones bluetooth like I do
 I paired phone individually headset, carry one phone time, always carry headset, I use either phone without pairing again
 

Item works great indoors sound quiet, I thought hearing checked reading reviews I learned me
 I work building construction lots loud noises can't hear unless I press unconfortabally ear
 Do recomend 

I loved comfort ease use headset
 I especially liked I could use Nokia chargers it
 Some drawbacks 3 months use were: volume always low
 Even highest level, (and excellent hearing)I press ear mike ear talking
 This made "hands free" "one-handed earpiece"
 The function buttons top side earpiece problem find driving
 All buttons tiny felt - adjustments troublesome
 The answer/hangup function bottomside boom convenient however, comfort piece fact I plastic/rubber thing ear (which I find distasteful)
 The charge time seem match specs
 The piece recharged frequently hold much charge uses
 In all, I would actually put shortcomings exchange comfort design volume issue disapointing dealbreaker
 

I really liked Nokia sat ear didn't move around
 It clear listen sounded fuzzy person
 After leaving couple messages hear I sounded, went back store
 C'est la vie
 

I chose bluetooth headset corded Nokia Boom headset Jabra Boom headsets broke
 I use Nokia 6230 (great phone) previously Nokia 6610 (also great phone)
I prefer behind ear headset bug ear versions
 I chose set sound quality comfort corded boom excellent overall satifaction Nokia products I owned
 I also liked fact I could charge headset existing Nokia phone adapter
 1 less thing carry
After I received headset I charged began using it
 Connecting phone easy connection quality solid
 I experienced drops
 Those I talk loud clear
While I pleased product many levels, I cannot recommend it
 The audio loud enough
 I hearing problems never issues volume headsets
 Like another reviewer mentioned, unless quiet environment, push speaker closer ear hear conversation clearly
 This defeats purpose hands free headset makes product almost useless since I use headset primarily car outside
I plan trying Jabra BT250v
 The pop port connector corded Jabra headset broke, I like ear gel concept
 It focused speaker ear could always callers well without phone volume max
 The Jabra behind ear design I like
 This combined ear gel provide good audio quality
 The downside Jabra I carry additional AC adapter power up
 

I happy product one exception: It needs volume
 I good hearing thing hard hear
 If I keep pressing ear, good it? I would recommend buying thing unless want look stylish won't able hear anything unless dead quiet outside
 

I bought headset almost year back
 It working well time
Initially I problems I switched off
 My cellphone go mute, headset button mute & turning off
 Then I followed proper method switching i
e
 disconnect cell & turning power down
It also got disconnected times calls, rare
Overall good one
 The design comfortable & light, won't even realize wearing it
 The audio quality better I talk directly phone
I would recommend this
 

Totally agree reviewers point fact sound level, even max volume, barely audible
 Completely useless car unless press uncomfortably deep ear AND hold there
 So much hands-free
 Why won't Nokia recognize problem either fix come version works? 

phisically little biger expected good reception "mute" feature excellent 

I bought Nokia HS-4W Boom Headset
It worked 10 days, I problem Itai Lustgarten "remeraz" (Israel) had
 However, I took local technical service store, fixed it
 Has worked without problems since
 They said cable loose
Oscar Foianini

mi parece que este es el producto original, la calidad del material es muy buena, el precio es aceptable y lo recibi en el tiempo que dijeron que lo recibiria
 

I bought data cable son's Nokia 6133
 It works great
 He able connect PC download music phone
 

There much said cable
 It job intended quality good enough continue job foreseeable future
 This cable meets criteria
 

This item market cable
 It doesn't fit phone well even though listed compatable
 The original cable worked much better
 This one stay connected phone
 It keeps slipping braking connection causing "synch" fail
 I physically hold cable place
 The locking device doesn't work
 At cost $1
00, that's it's worth
 

Cable connects directly phone allowing use Nokia Phone tools, contact management even USB mass storage
 

Recieved item within 3-4 business days, less shipper said
 Great product, works perfectly
 Minor mishap software cable uses, turned software manufactuer's issue
 Great product
 

Got data cable super affordable I access docs pics old phone
 Great buy
 

The CA-53 cable works well Nokia 7370
 Didn't problems plugging in
 The product well packaged arrived time
 

Nokia service providers ask $29
95 item
 I paid 1
99 perfect
 Delivery expensive I got purchased item within week I ordered it
 What could better? 

My daughter download music pictures computer phone problems
 

Fast delivery exactly needed
 My cell phone provider wanted $45 this
 

This product sells $50 I paid $10, including shipping
 Simple use works wonderfully
 I highly recommend anyone wants use phone mp3 player transfer pics vids computer 

bought nokia phone memory chip essentially useless
 It works unintuitive software
 Buy memory card card reader

I pleased quality, efficiency, also price CA-53 cables I ordered Amazon
 I would hesitate order products future
 

The cable works great
 I used Nokia 6126 model made excellent connection phone
 No issues time
 

bad wrong code work cell phone
 

The price good cable working well
 I good experience cable
 

Ok I went local cell shop I asked cable compatible brand new 6265i, fancy box, cool graphics
 The price? Over 30
 mmm let think over
 Yeah right
It's cable supposed to
I think I payed shipping actual item


 : ( 

This cable functions fine (at first), probably won't hold everyday use
 I've inserted mine maybe 20 times, one spring-loaded contacts became permanently stuck, making cable worthless
 Sure it's dirt cheap, nice compared expensive real Nokia cable, accessory vendors charge shipping, I'd recommend ordering several one time source good deal multiple items
 I'm trying decide whether shell real deal real warranty
 

I 6126
 This cable works perfect
 The nokia software great especially free
 For problems remember this: 1) cable go easily first times
 DOnt force firm 2)ignore software cable
 go directly nokia get free date version 3) follow directions could easer software walks use installation 4) always plug phone usb port - noticed glitch printer new windows tried reinstall software "new" even though using number times before
 FOr reason registers specific usb port use one time
 otherwise love this
 $2 ever company $50
 Quick shipping bargaincell
 

This Data cable allowed access Nokia 6085 (Black) phone's memory Firmware update using Nokia Suite, It designed for
PROS:(+) CheapCONS:(-) May last multiple uses port connector cable may eventually break time
Notes:(*) DO NOT use Driver CD comes product 

I received Eforcity Nokia CA-53 Cable, albeit rather tardy USPS

 Good investment money

Works great cheap
 forty seventy dollars main stores
 bought less five dollars
 What say
Thank 

The CA-53 cable compatible Nokia E62 phone, despite title product indicates is
 The Nokia E62 ships DKE-2 USB cable anyway
 

Works fine
 Difficult connect connects securely
 Comes unlabeled cd (couldn't tell one side other) great selection ringtones wallpapers, though tones aren't labeled helpful way
 I impressed
 It also links 1st party software need though I'm sure Google search would easy
 

It's 6-pin cable
 It works fine Win XP Vista, together nokia's pc suite
 You download upload musics wallpaper, etc


 But want unlock phone certain software cable, wont help
 You need 13-PIN cable


Good luck nokia 6126
 

So far product doesn't work
 However, I another another vendor didn't work
 So, don't blame vendor
The CA-53 delivered promptly cheap
 I bought good reviews product

 The company replace refund
 Just waste money
 Very poorly made cable
 

I received order 3 days via UPS
 I received exactly I ordered happy quality price
 I order company
 

This cable really good true
 The price cable unbelieveably cheap

and quality
 The connection piece broke first insert cable
That's get buying cheap
 

Eforcity Nokia CA-53 Compatible USB Data Cable Nokia 3230 / 3250 / 3300 / 6111 / 6125 / 6126 / 6131 / 6136 / 6170 / 6086 / 6230 / 6230i / 6233 / 6235 / 6235i / 6236 / 6236i / 6255 / 6255i / 6256 / 6260 / 6265 / 6265i / 6270 / 6280 / 6282 / 6630 / 6670 / N75 / E65 / E50 / N80 ie / E61i (no software driver)Excellent inexpensive cable saving lot trouble transferring data phone computer
 The bluetooth inside Nokia N80 always communicate computers similarly equipped
 

Very affordable cable exactly I wanted to
 I plugged USB port PC able following:- Make ringtones place phone (software required this, I used Cool Edit Pro 2
0)- Drag pictures taken onto desktop- Drag specific files phone transfer PC designated phone device
I pleased product
 Take good care it, problems
 

Excellent utility USB connectivity cable Nokia Mobile Phone personal computer
 It allows storing, preserving, securing data Phone computer, helps prevent loss phone-stored data, interact dynamically mobile phone computer
 I highly recommend useful Eforcity Nokia CA-53 compatible USB Data Cable
 

The cable doesn't quite fit phone
 It makes connection, it's angle really seated
 Skip one
 

I feel foolish even considered purchasing item
 The price should've red flag I still gave try
 A crutial piece plastic broke soon I plugged phone remained there, thus creating new project removing it
 Most importantly, cable doesn't work Nokia phones, company claims does, Nokia's drivers can't read it
 I fought thing hours, broke called Nokia find third party cables compatable
 However, Nokia's representative extremely knowledgable helpful reduce frustration
 Thankfully I paid next-to-nothing product
 I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE USELESSNESS OF THIS ITEM
 

The price right product came promptly accompanying CD work all, however I able download software Nokia get work part figured job fine
 

I would give product NO STARS minimum 1 star
 This cable broke day I received it
 One prongs fell off
 Well I guess old addage true, get pay for


 

This usb cord allows connect nokia computer I transfer data (musicm, pictures, etc
) If nokia compatiblities, definitely need cord
 

Not single glitch
 Fair priced FAST shipping
 NO problems hassles connecting syncing using Windows XP OR Vista
 What's love? 

I wasn't going pay compnay $65
00 cable canada
 Ordered Amazon, 10 days later worked like charm
 What I say dont look futher ca-53 cable order enjoy
 

haven't got package yet
i made mistake address
 correct address :4823 hwy 58 b
chattanooga, tn 37416
 

The product works reliably cost lesss 50% cell network phone manufacturer would supply for
 

received item quickly, worked well advertized
 No problems encountered
 

I almost didn't buy cable seemed "too" cheap, Nokia price $50
00, well know - "you get pay 


" But time
 I think I paid $0
88 cable, works like $50
00
 Beats it, I'm happy customer
 It works
 

This cable quite handy have, computer can't wirelessly connect cellphone
 Makes super easy drag 'n drop files, images, ringtones, etc right phone's memory
 I'm glad I got great price, too
 

Everything great product receiving product
 Everything advertised, great
 

I thought, price, product fake
 But works like charm problems all
 

This nearly free works perfectly
 As long phone list compatible models problems
 

I ordered item purely basis cost received 4 days pleased start
Having read reviews, I plugged phone computer trepidation delighted see worked perfectly immediately
Would recommend product supplier anyone
 

I bought cable Eforcity, provides fast shipping good customer services
 With price 25% OEM's price, I figured I getting cable
 And cable excellent


 I highly recommend deal company next time
 

I know lot people said product didnt work works me
 Its easy downloading PC Suite plugging phone in
 Super fast processing shipping
 

Absolute piece junk
 Check warranty date, piece junk designed break day warranty runs out
 I bought one Nokia still works



5 years later
 Go directly Nokia buy real thing
 

Doesn't fit real tight, long don't wave phone around works
 

I recently purchased nokia phone didn't come cables
 Seeing cable 2$ nokia brand cable 30$, simple choice
The problem drivers cable old didn't let connect seller good letting know drivers software needed NEW phone
overall, good purchase connect pc update contacts upload mp3s sd card without removing battery
 

This cable REALLY cheap WORKS

 I used nokia 6126--the cable hard get port first, know you're forcing wrong way, gets easier I absolutely NO connection problems
 Good luck
 

I actually bought cable ebay like $7
05 I realize I bought instead
 Either ways, works perfectly I didn't spend fortune it
 By way, anyone nokia 6126 anything similar that, don't install Nokia PC suite all, connect cable computer, choose option says "data storage" phone file automatically open computer
 All copy paste saved computer transfer files transfer phone
 It's worth money
 

The main attraction product low price
I Nokia 6126 Phone mentioned compatible cable
 Well, is


but took hour experimentation software downloads
The driver disk came product didn't work XP machine
 Apparently, Software driver enclosed CD-R may possibly out-of-date phones
It necessary download PC Driver Nokia Software Nokia Website (a free download writing)- After that, worked fine, although, install, strange warnings USB cable defective (it not)
Overall, I satisfied save bunch money simple cable probably provided phone first place
 

purchased USB cord nokia 6265i retail store 60 dollars don't work phone 
 bought one already price affordable 
 received product mail yesterday works perfectly 
 GREAT PRODUCT 
 

DO NOT buy product last
 Worked one month fell apart
 

I recently bought Nokia 6265 wanted upload music create ringtones
 However Nokia CA-53 cable around 50 dollars
 This great alternative
 So far everything I used working flawlessly
 I would highly suggest buying item wanted cheaper alternative CA-53
 

This product helps copy anything computer nokia phone
I love death use almost everyday
Eforcity really good job shipping I completely want bussiness them
 

This real deal folks
 A great bargain
 I'm pleased purchaseof affordable, inexpensive, sturdy cable
 I recommend anyone whoneeds download data Nokia
 It job me
 Fast andefficient shipping
 Thank Amazon
 

Didn't fit Nokia 6085 even original product description claimed would
 I show labeled wrong since I complained changed description
 At end gave refund hazzle get point
 

Not item cheap (+shipping $4) worked perfectly
 This cable stores $10
 I thought might cheap imitation worth gamble
 Good shipping time & perfectly priced item
 

I bought cable back contacts SIM card Nokia 6085 phone
 I loaded Nokia PC Suite (a free download), connected cable able make connection transfer data computer
 Mission accomplished
 Now I lose phone, I copy contacts PC new SIM card type 100+ names numbers back in
My caveats cable (a) others mentioned, difficult get "click" position first times use it
 You play around bit figure locks place
 Hopefully manage without breaking phone connector, (b) built rather flimsy construction
 I don't OEM cable imagine much sturdier
Still, price, go wrong? To cover bases, consider ordering two case first one breaks wears out
 

Bought cable last year used couple weeks I decided replace cable Nokia
This Eforcity unit made cheap-feeling material
 Takes bit plug computer in, still doesn't work lot times
 So I unplug go thru process times
Yes price low
 But overall item unstable
 

The cable it's supposed do
 The quality seems good, it's obviously made match specific phone
 Good price, quick delivery
 

This product works good one selling local wireless store $60
00











AWSOME DEAL can't beat price stick









Thank YouJason Horton 

The hardware good excellent price
Software neat little CD updated run VISA
I able download latest software ran VISA NOKIA site problem
 

This exactly I needed $5 including shipping
 You can't beat that
 

All need download latest version software From Nokia's web site newer phone included mini CD supports
 The software free long get version compatable phone cable need quickly easily transfer data PC
 Buy cable Nokia Charging FIFTY FREAKING BUCKS FOR THE CABLE
 

I wanted right price shipped promptly
 Love plan comes together
 Thank 

My phone come cable I struggling transfer music phone
 The cable made syncing transferring files much easier
 












































These cases great, fit perfect, experience I tell DOES protect Treo occasional oopsie
The upsides:It's inexpensiveIt protects TreoIt fits perfectlyIt's quite 'sticky', put Treo dashboard it's going anywhere
The downsides:It's quite 'sticky', it's hard pull pocket hurryThe 'Smoke Grey' color looks kind dirty, like it's supposed clear it's old
Would I buy product again? For sure, different color
 A great buy you're looking spend ton money case
 






















































I bought two these
 One works great,easy use, secures phone place
 I'd give 5 stars
 The won't hold phone place, useless
 No stars it
 

This item easy find, purchase use
 Saved us several dollars well
 A true win-win
 Thanks
 





I bought battery wife's cell phone last Christmas (2000) Last week (7/2001) battery quit working
 Even though shows full charge dies less minute talk time
 I would recommend product
 



What life saver instant battery packs turned Hurricane Wilma phones month electricity charge cell phone
 I hand since I always running cell battery charge
 What fantastic idea, thanx


Myndi Rosenfeldt, Florida 

I agree previous positive reviews want add I keep inexpensive little battery boosts car, motorcycle, boat always least couple pocket
By force habit, I take I grab cell phone keys leaving house; they're convenient
As much I go often neglect carry charger me, I'm never worried many battery charge bar indicators showing
For dollars, I backup power source phone, quite lifesaver you're traveling fairly remote areas country
Get least 4 6 distribute among briefcases vehicles
 

Rarely find product works better manufacturer claims
 This one times
 I bought Cellboost Samsung phone local drug store chain
 My phone quite dead, near there
 The package claims give 60 hours standyby time 60 minutes talk time 1 hour charge
 To quite honest, I haven't used 60 minutes
 But, notice I said 1 hour charge suppose get
 Well I charged one hour work
 I took home charged phone another hour
 None full charge
 I woke next morning popped approx
 half hour phone stated FULLY CHARGED
 It doesn't stop I'm actually charging phone device today (bought 2 days ago) charging icon phone
 So, device definately good item emergency
 You may get full charge it
 I recommend everyone buy least one emergency
 It claims good 3 years (i
e
 touch 3 years use it)
 I'm guessing estimates based year 3, right performing 3 times better claim
 

nothing good experiences item
 unfortunately longer Nokia several 2 packs left
 let go $9
00 shipped
 (at yahoo)
 

I ordered item said would fit cell phone got produce packaging nokia phones listed mine
 doesn't fit
 Look listing
 nokia 6255i listed product info DOES NOT FIT THIS PHONE
 please make sure know listing list it
 

This cable good price works well one catch:In Windows XP, I first attached Nokia 6255i, Windows recognized memory card inside phone flash drive
 Nokia PC Suite recognize phone all
 In order Nokia PC Suite see phone, must use "Safely Remove Hardware" icon System tray "Safely Remove USB Mass Storage Device
" After doign this, must wait Nokia PC Suite see phone, could take minutes
This conflict resolved uninstalling re-installing Nokia PC Suite DKU-2 Cable driver Nokia came phone
By way, cable comes absolutely instructions
 You must install DKU-2 Cable driver Nokia hopes working properly sync phone
Conclusion: complicated syncing IR much faster
 That speed increase important syncing playlists phone Nokia Audio Manager
 

The DKU-2 cable easiest way transfer Windows XP machine
 Bluetooth Windows XP SP2 work well together
 


















A nice, compact power adapter, I use charge d
light solar products time time, accomplish job well
 I would buy need be
 

This charger Nokia phones
My phone uses BL-6F battery
It charges battery
I happy
 

I bought charger original broke, I replaced one
 It works good I got good price
 

The charger originally came phone died
 This replacement exactly like original (as far I tell) works fine
 

I old Nokia phone I use personally
 This charger simple needs
 Although, charger needs retractable cord
 

Prices good true
Well, sometimes good things really happen
But discriminating
Just make sure getting original, authentic NOKIA AC-3U
First sign would comes authentic NOKIA retail packaging
Watch vendors claim: "bulk packaging"
There many "look-alikes", many, totally different units "work-alikes"
Next, look authentic NOKIA documentation product, Warranty Certificates
Do fooled
 Even authentic Nokia products may turn "lemons" (though strict Nokia quality controls minimize this), least you'll get full protection warranty certificates
Many fakes, look-alikes
 work-alikes, Nokia wannabe's, work seemingly "alright" first time use
 But may last long, worse, may damage unit charging longer run
I made clear vendor send unit sealed, original manufacturer's packaging, didn't
 There way I could establish authenticity (other vendor's unconvincing words)
 Finally, I happy get full refund Amazon's A-Z Guarantee
 

This exactly I looking for
No regret


 I suggest stuff anyone willing get it

This charger works
 Its orderly provision electrons telephone clear; I'd say even indisputable
Sure, I've chargers before
 And chargers worked satisfactorily
 They supplied electrical flow, given specifications defining current, voltage frequency, device whose energy requirements could satisfy
 Whether telephones, MP3 players, batteries, computers, cameras sundry myriad energy-consuming portable contraptions whose presence activity suffused public spaces contemporary society, changed conceptions practices social interaction, information retrieval intertextual narration, devices absorbed energy needed respective chargers, went perform intended functions
And charger arrived
It came unassuming box, investigation accompanying literature made clear was, end, one way charger likely used
 Upon accepting tightly defined boundaries charger's identity -- proclivity perform single action, way adequate achieve evident goal -- I ready proceed device's inaugural employment
Plugging AC-3U travel charger wall, proceeding plug it, turn, phone, confirmed expectations capable fulfilling tasks I set it
 The electrical current seemed flow phone, phone turn accepted current visually confirming such, along progressive charging battery
It things clarified
 This charger works

I bought case I could find nice leather case Nokia E62
 I got case close around phone
 I e-mailed Accessory one sent different case much better actually fits phone
 


I usually don't feel compelled writing reviews product deserves one
Background: I work mobile division company many mobile devices I usually purchase case
 As I believe I compare quality different case
Findings: This BlackBerry style case clip attach belt trouser
 The back made leather front transparent plastic
 The Krussell lettering dominantly displayed case (which I personally dislike) accompanying brochure states Krusell lifestyle statement maybe it's important someone
Expensive: I wonderful BlackBerry cases 7$
 Over 20$ case really high side maybe lifestyle case select group mobile users
The case tight: I read reviews didn't believe really really tight
 1mm side would make much easier put phone in
 This minor point I intending put often
It hard use keyboard: The transparent plastic keyboard relatively rigid happens time inputting numbers means inadvertently input neighboring numbers
 It pretty annoying need press 20 numbers (and clear) instead 10 input phone number
Pushbutton brock: In back phone two riveted snap fasteners
 The intend allow users open back use camera
 The snap fasteners made plastic tiny backing plate
 When using fastener second time backing slipped leather it's permanently disconnected now
 It's technically fault I sure I give back Amazon
I would shy away buying case
 The N73 beautiful phone maybe best solution buy screen protector
 

Is Good, protecs every corner phone, keyboard screen
 Its good
 100% Recomendation
 

satisfied good product nice buying trhrt rthrth th erth qeth eth th 3rg g5 3egt 5 35gt45 q45g ergh htyw trh 

elegant type case keeping n73 well protected
 It bit pricy it's well built
 

YES



this mobile phone case tight loosen awhile
I found beautifully made months, yet shows sign wear tear
 I admit using belt clip cant vouch it
 It somewhat awkward taking photo due design N73 camera slide cover
 I think case represents true value, looks smart great job protecting Nokia 


what ask for
 It gets vote
 



PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR YOUR N73

I bought product Amazon (seller: SF Planet)
 Trying get mobile case taking nightmare
 The case EXTREMELY TIGHT fitting practically useless
 I wonder whether case really designed N73 advertised
My honest opinion - please waste hard earned money product

 

I got one I bought Nokia N73
 It I want phone case do: clips belt, protects phone (particularly screen)
 It *does* couple drawbacks, however:1
 The case *very* tight; getting phone (such change battery SIM card) major undertaking
 (This might get better time
)2
 The snap cover back covers phone camera unsnaps easily
 When hanging belt, moderate pressure top phone (such getting overstuffed chair) likely pop snaps, leaving phone dangling belt
 The zip case keeps phone secure, however
For low-impact environments I think great product
 For 'heavy-duty' 'power user' environments, though, snap problem makes it, well, problematical
 IMHO
 



































































































































































































Plugged phone says "Not Charging" stop sign screen
Plugged original charger works fine
DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE
 

I purchased charge Nokia 6030
 The plug fit though charging happens
 




























Needed buy batteries bosses dated Nokia bar phones, glad see someone still batteries
 The batteries charge 100%, like 90% enough get next phones
 Shipped quickly without problems
 

Everyhing fine I problem shippment, I order, working fine
 










My new cell phone Verizon, otherwise free, didn't come holster, first one I've gotten didn't
I balked paying price Verizon charging theirs, purely principle
This one arrived day new cell phone even though I didn't save much money deal, I'm happy it
Some colleagues market pouches phones paid less local stores, none horizontal variety, I like lot
My concern clip rather short I tend wear wide belts
 However, I wore case last night held onto belt plenty tightly, might problem
 The clip long given horizontal configuration case, I already stated I like
This little product attractive, well made sturdier less expensive Verizon's offerings
*********************My first pouch met untimely demise due unfortunate accident made unusable
That case worked well accident would destroyed product, regardless quality
The new one I fits VX-5300 even snugly, better makes case seem less universal custom made
This good product I can't recommend enough
 

Nice, comfortable pouch
 Clip slightly stiff get off, pouch comfortable doesn't chafe worn belt, like many clip ons do
 

I bought pouch dad
 When I got looked pretty cheaply made, $2 + shipping I didn't really care
 After month belt clip ripped case
 Buyer beware
 

fits lg chocolate 3 perfectly I absolutely love it
 holds onto belt without trouble
 

I purchase leather case 1 month ago 
Yes leather case LOVE IT
This good purchase
 

At price, wasn't sure expect
 But, quality good higher priced cases I've bought past
 I would buy again
 

I getting ready purchase cell phone case cell phone store almost $30
00, I saw Universal Horizontal Medium Pouch Leather Case Amazon
 I purchased $3
00, I recieved looked brand new, holds cell phones well
 I either carry hand, clip pants pockets, clip purse
 It compatible sizes cell phones
 The Nokia 6085 fits perfectly it, also Motorola phones
 

I LG VX8300 phone I use holster
At first, I like holster phone quite fit
It struggle force phone deeply enough allow magnetic flapto close
 But week so, work I able use confidencethe flag pop open allow phone come out
 

purchased samsung phone ones listed easily altered fit inserting small strip adhesive backed foam
 

Got one mother's LG Cu400, ends resting little loose pouch
 With flap though, still works fine
 






Received equipment good time
 Was quality stuff



for I paid it
 Does job quite well
 I would order company
 

I bought set [inexpensive]
 U get u pay for
 The leather carying case fit phone perfectly
 I'm constantly moving around doesnt cover keys phone
 The case also doesn't clear plastic cover protect screen, I think would important part geting case
 Why would need leather case for, doesnt clear plastic face cover? The clip case also isn't good
 It allows phone fall belt easily, pressing button
 If going working, I wouldn't suggest would let phone fall easily
 Right I don't even use clip anymore
 The charger works, that's reason product geting 2 star rating
 But I would highly suggest buying different case
 



















The earpiece allows great sound quality quite comfortable
 The microphone also works well, (according people I called) applifies everything
 If even slight breeze, microphone picks up
 The one thing I unhappy about: significantly reduces reception
 I tried using several areas, every case, reception indicator line two (or three
) without handset plugged in
 

The earpiece, I figured (no real instructions), comfortable wear provides good sound quality volume
 My complaint connector Nokia phones
 It sticks phone, increasing chances it'll snapped accidentally
 It also &quot;release&quot; button, I'm worried putting adaptor phone result something breaking wearing time
 

The headset works nicely I hear well surprise considering I small percentage hearing loss
 It doesn't get 5 stars doesn't fit ear comfortable
 I expected better fit adjustments it
 Then could I odd shaped ear
 

VERY GOOD HEADSET
 I LOVE IT
 VERY LIGH AND EASY TO CARRY
 GOOD SOUND QUALITY
 IT IS LOUD TOO
 




Bought product days ago, I'm return tomorrow
 While I like concept, design, problems:1- many cords everywhere
 know probably unavoidable, annoying


2- poor sound quality
 speaker cut out3- microphone major feedback, wherever placed relation speaker
but relatively inexpensive


 

For price okay purchase
 Simply reasonable device reasonable audio microphone speaker
 This device worth money need hands free functionality fast don't need something fancy
 The negative blocks ashtray (change holder) drink holder due cigarette lighter placement
 Would I purchase another? Possibly yes
 Just find good place rest phone unless set auto-answer

This charger high quality, works great I'm glad I spent money get instead buying yet another 99c charger


now mistake
 My advice, spend money, last long time
 

Can't ask more, arrived within 5 days
 Using right replace original one broke N95-3
 Works like charm 

I suppose OEM, says Nokia 400 times expensive options
 In case, works fine
 The cord sufficiently long, velcro strap secure cord storing it
 

I like original nokia charger

Very cheap shipping expensive original price
 

work 6101 /6102 probably many modelsit job bad atall 

The price unbeatable
 The product good working condition
 The problem metal parts plug spread apart much it's hard plug socket
 

The item sold actually Nokia AC-4U charger (might nice include information somewhere, seller
)
 Though "small barrel" charger, WILL NOT NECESSARILY work "small barrel" Nokia cell phone (particularly newer models)
 Even worse, may *appear* work, actually charge phone
 This happened Nokia E51 - plug fits fine, I plug beeps says "Charging" shows charging animation
 But I go pick morning, charged phone - battery completely dead
 It actually *drained* battery faster plugged in
The "compatible" charger Nokia recommends newer phones AC-8U
 Unfortunately you'll find pay substantially pick up
 This posted Nokia's web site AC-8U: "Charge Nokia device Nokia 2 mm charging interface
" Sounds good
 Now contrast says AC-4U (the item sold here):"* WARNING: Use batteries, chargers, enhancements approved Nokia use particular model
 The use types may invalidate approval warranty, may dangerous
"Uh oh
 That doesn't sound good
 Not may invalidate warrany, "may dangerous"
 Beware exploding batteries
This inexcusable Nokia's part, especially people actually damaged phones way
 It also makes wonder might happen "imitation" chargers buy reputable places like Target Radioshack
 Here's hint, Nokia: If using old model charger cause phone explode, alter connector type one uses wrong one accident
 

Don't buy adapter

 The picture shown receive, picture shows genuine Nokia adapter get cheap piece crap doesn't even specifications Nokia adapter
 So don't want fry device, don't buy this
 

item arrived described, regular charger new nokia tip
 It works great E61
 

I using generic phone charger Nokia E50 average charge time dead battery 3 hours
 The battery life way standards
 After using original nokia charger, I charge two dead batteries less 3 hours phone perform better terms battery life
 Using original nokia charger also protects inadvertently damaging phone battery
 

I purchased two tese chargeres
 They worked perfectly "One" day, charged Nokia N800 Nokia Ld-30 GPS receiver
 The next day chargers cease function devices fried
 Im $300
00 $8
00 purchase
 I never purchase anything vendor I recommend one should
 Unless manufacturer original device I puchase
 This costly lesson learn
 I would recommend Amamzon drop vendor
 

There's much say charger - it's official Nokia charger phones made last two years, works mains connection fit US-type blades, regardless voltage
I've used E90 N810 problems, though I might add doesn't seem charge even half quickly charger came devices originally, despite size
 

It OEM Nokia charger really cheap
 It great deal 

If you're work extended periods, travel lot, phone poor battery life keep bag - it's invaluable
Otherwise, buy one keep you're bag case - it's cheap functional
 

I realized one get authentic Nokia charger $6(it marked $24)
 Here I thinking seems like good deal cheap charger name "NAKLA" shows up
 I think ok, maybe one third party things might work plug in
 Initially, I plug whole hour I see charged 20%
 A normal Nokia charger would charge almost 90% time
I 15 minute phone call battery died me
 I plugged charger black screen I never seen E71
 I trying firmly press pin pin snapped
 I regret purchased product
 I need new charger I even sure I turn phone again
 Maybe mistake even cost battery
 

Bought two I various places (work, school, home) charge Nokia E71x phone
 Worked advertised
 One worked arrived (the plug didn't go way phone)
 Contacted vendor promptly sent another one out
 These chargers much write about
 

Purchased charger replace broken e71 charger
 Works correctly
 Unbeatable price
 Nokia AC-4U charger model number
 I would pay twice much it
 Great stuff
 

Have probs cahrger till date phone screen went blank dont know why
 I can't see calls neither I dial cos touch screen
 ger blackberry fone
 

Not whole lot review - Shipping fast ordering nice easy, product showed described - Its wall charger nokia phone, I plugged in, works - Hooray

 

I decided buy product original charger Nokia N70 broke, It perfect replacement, worked without hassle
 My complaint took long get delivered house, almost 2 weeks long
 

I liked product came time happy product
 It shown described good fit NOKIA 5300 phone
 

This charger exact size connector types phones
 The reason important I bought non-original Nokia chargers get disconnected (come out) easily
 This one charges fast stays in
 

The phone charger arrived within three days confirmation order item works perfectly well
 

This wall charger really good
 Battery charged faster one I came cell phone
 

This item works exactly intended
 I received real NOKIA charger
 My phone I bought ebay came aftermarket charger, stopped working couple months, would need fiddle indefinitely get charge would move mm stop charging
 This charger works every time, far (a couple months) without problem
 

Save $30-$40 major carriers would charge replacement store
 No complaints
 

This product good original nokia charger, also shipping extremly fast I ordered Friday came Monday 

I bought one back-up charger
 Does job
I prefer tiny Nokia CA-100 USB charger though use most
Works nice Nokia N95-3 phone Nokia 800 Internet Tablet
 

Thought I going get cheap replacement (not one pictured)
 This nokia charger (ac-4u) came n800
 The difference come velcro strap
 

I bought charger replace original Nokia cell phone charger, one perfect, much cheaper version works great
 An original Nokia charger replacement would've cost $20
 

I, general careful equipment wires associated
 I ended damaging/breaking charger tip N800 I tripped it, needed new one
 With charger priced low, OEM version, I couldn't pass it
 So, I bought 2 them, one backup
 They delivered around 3 days, work perfectly
 No issues all
 Very happy
 

This isn't really good product, reason end plug connects mobile's charging port
 It's small fragile, 4th one I've buy within two year owning Nokia e71x
 I also bit careless that's well thought charger
 I would recommend product Nokias good mobile except particular designed Charger
 

The product work, work, I feel cheated, working,should mislead consumers way, honest
 

I received product time, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK
 It worked first time I inserted phone, first time, stopped working
 I tried 6 different electricity jacks, different phones, it's working
 DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER
 

Plain simple, bought charger charge e71x, working
 If newer nokia model waste time money buying item
Its even nokia made like says add, made Nakla-wtf
 

I checked product I received it
 It marked NOKIA NAKLA

 Is side view charger website? I angry charger working well(it works fine far), dishonest behavior seller
 It says Nokia AC-4U Travel Charger website, except product not
 

The item supplied OEM Nokia charger stated description
 I received NaKLA ACP-12E charger instead
 The units plug loose phone
 It marked Under Writers (UL) logo
 I dared plug wall instead took steps return item
 

Before I ordered, I saw reviews saying charger would work phone
 The charger works fine Nokia model 6133
 Cheap sent quickly
 

Not much say AC adapter :) It's compact, charges quickly, it's inexpensive
 To whining charger working phone, surely checked manual/spec phone ensure works AC-4U buying
 Electronics aren't lego - Just fits hole doesn't mean it's OK :P 

Got Nokia AC-4U charger phone
 Very fast shipping
 The Nokia AC-4U works well phone seems problems with
 This seller highly recommended
 

This great product
 Bought forgetting charger traveling
 Arrived brand new condition charges E-72 efficiently
 Would highly recommend anyone looking Nokia charger
 

This product seems fit snuggly port
 I've purchased three chargers phone (E71 Unlocked) year half one seems work far
 The original charger short, one car charger got short year felt loose one I recently purchased another car charger loose extremely short cordNokia DC-4 Mobile Charger(although stretchy, useless pulls easy)
Pros: Charges phoneCon: Takes two three ports power strip 

I bought charger sister accidentally vacuumed old one Nokia N810 Portable Internet Tablet works great
 Shipping like 50 cents U
S
 money came within 2 days
 loved it
 

i've purchased official AC-4u charger AT&T retailer, voila
 It HAS worked
 losing device, trying replace w/ THIS ac-4u
 No luck
 Be careful phone ANY MIGHT fit
 

My original charger died 3 months due Hawaii's moisture humidity
 The charging port covered rust longer function
 I found charger searching "E71 charger"
 There lot sellers averaging around $5 shipping
 If live near California, I recommend buying Dealscaly
 They sell $1
49 shipping arrived California's address within 2 days
 Great deal brand new original Nokia charger
 

Thank directly calling resolving matter item shipped sending another one
:) 

Nokia could get charger fit Tracfone tell model number needed
 So, I turned old reliable, Amazon, took shot one
 Amazon shipped right away, model didn't fit
 Later, different model charger Amazon work
 

Including factory charger, third time I replace charger since purchasing Nokia e71x Feb
 2010
 I never replace charger phone I ever owned, therefore I believe Nokia made poor quality product begin with
 This charger works great (as two beginning) comes reasonable price
 Good thing since I extremely apprehensive whether last months
 Just hope last I able upgrade phone small headphone/charger jack
 







































































The shipping item good, quality terrible
 Needs recharging almost everyday whereas OEM battery could last days
 The use phone changed cannot factor
 

This item obviously USED repackaged plain plastic bag
 This battery arrived scratched scruffed black markings clearly evident previous uses
 MY OEM battery made Japan received battery labeled Made China
 The received battery also hold charge half time OEM battery
 Cost return shipping exchange worthwhile
 Buying another replacement replacement another vendor
 

This battery original equipment manufactured specific Nokia cellphones
 It charged works perfectly, expected
 The similar battery replaced lasted 3 years
 The price paid less half cellphone service quoted, including shipping
 

I believe OEM battery
 The real difference I see there's Nokia hologram sticker original one also made China new one
It doesn't seem last quite long original may I'm using phone more
At rate, I'm satisfied old battery it, I'll probably buy sell something I need
The battery arrive estimated delivery date
 

I recently purchased Nokia battery Amazon
 It dead battery local cell phone company replaced battery works
 While first Nokia battery purchased Amazon, it's second identical Nokia that's gone kaput within first year using
 I cannot recommend product
 

This product works great, saved purchasing new cell phone
 The battery last long time I need recharge
 For dollars well worth buy want save little money verses buying new cell phone
 The company prompt delivering product
 Will business supplier future
 

I needed contact vendor, since first one simply charge up
 The vendor accomodating, sent one works fine
 I satisfied
 


This good purchase
 It came $50 air time start subscription
Good durable phone
For people desire Touch Screen phone, good deal
 It cost arms legs
 Hooray
 

Until I purchased DKU-2 Data Cable NOKIA 6620 Cellphone, I unable download various information computer
 Now, DKU-2 Data Cable NOKIA 6620 Cellphone, I go online, download information stored NOKIA 6620 Cellphone specific messages mobile phone, many applications
 The DKU-2 Data Cable available except AMAZON
 And, therefore, I'm grateful AMAZON able purchase DKU-2 Data Cable NOKIA 6620 Cellphone
 

















































































































































































This knock-off, genuine article
 It works fine, I pleased purchase
 



















This cable saves lot money
 I don't need buy stuff online I download straight PC
 makes easy transfer Pictures, videos, ring tones, contact numbers
 It great put things off
 Also great keeping back up
 

For price, I thought I'd give data cable try
 A try I got
 I got older phone transfer data pictures newer phone, never could get phone recognized software
 

No instructions, came unusable twice, returned
 It expensive I paid shipment three times
 (once I first placed order, twice, I returned first time, three times I returned again)It worth it, better go local phone store, spend less might get higher quality item
 

I purchased cable ago Nokia 6800 cellular phone
For price, can't beat it
 But that's ends
 It seldomly works phone, works all
 The connector low standard I suspect there's something wrong pin configuration, doesn't exactly match Nokia cable
 It also doesn't work third party software like Oxygen, gives better control standard Nokia communication suite
You'll better buy authentic Nokia cable $10 more
 

This item work 7250 since 7250 transfer files infrared gprs
 The product info misleading - make sure check phone first
 I didn't attempt return product since additional cost return it
 

































Great product
 Inexpensive & works great
 Received timely fashion
 Would reccomend anyone
 Thanks great service

Not technically advanced Nokia there, no
But mobile phone TALK make statement you're it, THE puppy
The quality materials, finishing, durability top notch, best Nokia ever done standard offer mobile phone
It feels heavy smooth, almost slick hand
 When push screen open, glides
Its sexy
And darn expensive :(However, thanx quality materials manufacture, last little longer rest them
 












































































It's good case/ pocket great attachment features
 Not sure it's listed case flip phones doesn't flip open? It certainly easy find loose purse protect phone heavy enough I won't use FT purse cell phone pocket, starting to
 And again, want flip open phone extract pouch flip open phone
 Hence flip case got ****
 Also case MUCH darker shown
 Think dark denim & red
 Still can't beat price multitude ways carry it
 Great outdoors 

I love product, hard find one too
 I think stylish, (I got dark grey/red one)& practical
 I pleased armband , utility clip neck cord came box-excellent value
 Other sources items extras
 I Motorola Razr flip phone works really well case
 It really best case design I've seen right now
 I think looks sporty smart, trashy like alot cases I think would suit Males Females
Well done Naztech, lets 2nd generation Ipod shuffle case/armband now
 































































































































































































































The BH-800 Bluetooth Headset tiny - doesn't scream, "Hello
 I'm wearing bluetooth
" The little led light subtle well
 It's also comfortable; I don't even use detachable earloop even earloop on, sunglasses problem small bendable
 This first Bluetooth Headset I didn't think I would like but, minutes, I forgot I on
 I paired Nokia 6102i phone sound excellent - incoming outgoing
 The bonus Nokia phone headset I don't carry extra chargers - BH-800 uses charger 6102i
 I like fact that, initial pairing process (easy), I turn automatically pairs phone
 I also like fact volume rocker easy use
 The last call re-dial easy and, since I mostly use phone calling home, I need call road, quick double-tap takes care (I don't fancy stuff like voice-dial enabled phone)
 Also nice I actually hear phone ring - using cell, I couldn't ever hear ringing music rings ear I definitely hear it
 Some online reviews complained tiny on-off button - yes, I use fingernail push least I know it's turned accidentally purse running it's batteries down
 The carry pouch handy, too, keeps everything one place
 I don't use cell phone often, mostly emergencies let husband know I'm way home work, now, hands-free law California, I needed something road nice way jump 'Bluetooth world'
 This keeper
 

Excellent product, exactly I would expect Nokia
 The volume button needs better placement I always adjusting volume accident
 The ear loop necessary
 My big ears hold headset perfectly
 I use chain rearview mirror hold headset driving works great
 doesn't hold headset securely enough wear chain
 I upgrading phone (currently nokia 6103) december '08 we'll see works upgrade
So Far So Good
 

I like headset
 I wear without wire ear hook fits nicely ear canal
 The audio quality good
 It easy set easy use
 One best bits clip comes "silver" chain hang round neck makes hard lose
 I wear continuously replaced chain silver rope tarnish, People often think phone comment small size
 

Pros:Sound quality good
Battery time good
Uses standard Nokia charger
Different buttons power call operations
Good grip ear
Small light
Cons:Sometimes disconnects standby mode, needs paired again
 (Both Nokia E71 iPhone)Doesn't work multiple phones without re-pairing earpiece every time
Overall:Considering price, high value
 

This wonderful headset
CompactLightStylishGood audio sidesGreat value 
Nice quality
It works great Apple iPhone 3G looks cool too
A necessity Albuquerque use cell phone vehicle handsfree
Highly recommended 

 

Excellent size, appearance ergonomics, sound quality ends lack noise cancellation makes returned product disappointment me
 






























I bought lot screen protectors, hard install well, worst
 Impossible install well start peeling edges almost immediately
 Also, I bought 3-pak one three missing altogether package
 






























































































































































































































































































































The case I received phone poor quality fit way supposed to
 I since sent back get refund issued
 

The charger headphone work great phone fit phone holder, phone holder piece JUNK



 












































Awesome features, Very Sturdy, Sexy looking
 My problem reception
 Which non existant except occasionally
 I could never get one bar I 5 seconds
 The speaker sensitive friends complained loud distorted I sounded talking them
 I could lived sound good phone can't talk it? They don't sell America apparently wife ordered overseas somewhere unknowingly
 

I used kits BMW MB SL500 various phones - works great retrofit handsfree system
 Has audio system coordination radio
 































I'm using case extensively 6620
 It fits phone snugly, plastic sheet covers keypads (which I like)
 There openings platic cover wherever you'd expect - microphone, loudspeaker, speaker, joystick etc
 And I use regularly hold phone belt
 The leather seems decent too
 My reservation though price - get phone free days, I think twice charged $20 case
** An update: 6 months use, case broke down
 And I've (accidentally) dropped phone often, phone survives admirably well
 When complex pice electronics phone survive several falls, I'm impressed plastic case breaking months
 Amazon doesn't let change star rating, I couldn't lower 4-stars I gave initially
 

Belt strap isn't useful adds unnecessary bulk, rest case offers good protection
 

Just perfect
 Good quality leather
 Good craftsmanship
 Attention details
 Solid belt clip stays firm
 Great buy
 

Great case
 Fits exactly Nokia 6600
 I recommend case
 Very fast shipping also
 

I love snug fit design case
 The first case I had, didn't allow proper access buttons side
 The case seems quite durable weak point multiadapt system
 The clips seem held thin sliver plastic either side adaptor time stresses daily use cause eventually break
 I second case noticed one cracking well
 It takes good months happen I like cases last life phone
 They need redesign make thicker resistant stress
 If wasn't multiadapt weakness I'd given 5 stars I consider serious deisgn flaw reduce 3
 

The Nokia 6060 6061 cellphones pretty easy use
 They lacking outside window person see may calling
 The cellphone opened view incoming call
 However, leu this, phone easy use cellphone
 The cell phone buttons side, person accidentally push using phone
 The 6060 6061 incorporate features person may desire, course, depending service provider, call waiting, call forwarding, voice mail, menus set phone, etc
 Overall rating 4 stars
 The buttons aren't small
 The screen good color graphics
 The screen could little bit larger, isn't bad
 It fits hand nicely
 It light compact folded
 A person choose answer upon opening fold (but wouldn't know called) wait open phone push answer button

While case nice offers lot protection, doesn't fit large Lumia 900
 Even managed force Lumia 900 sleeve I don't think could get back again
 My old iPhone 4 fits (without bumper); I think Lumia 800 may also fit since it's smaller phone
 Three stars good quality
 Disapointed small I really wanted
 










Very good cover
 Though one piece clear front cover make bit harder operate middle multi-function button
 But cover held well considering punishment put dropping second floor building
 




















































































































































This piece junk, cant hear it
 Dont waste time money
 

Great affordable headphone
 Never problem
 The seller Eforcity shipped day, lightning fast shipping, highly recommended
 






























sent wrong items first, quick email, fixed, got right ones good time, fit wonderfully
 








sent wrong items first, quick email, fixed, got right ones good time, fit wonderfully
 

Excellent design, bit pricey reception greatest weak stations i

 Overall well built, attractive overall great product
 

The unlocked 6233 great phone one drawback US users
 It fully compatible Cingular's voice mail system
 For reason voicemail indicator light would register message
 When work would register message deleted
 According Nokia Cingular software phone updated yet Cingular feature phone primarily made European Asian 3G GSM networks
 

It's 850/1800/1900 amazon says 

 It 900/1800/1900 
I alredy sent e-mail costumer service 
 But didn't change yet 
 And probably never 
 

As another reviewer noted, listed description phone wrong, read detailed specs see
 It 850mhz compatible, actually 900mhz, work AT&T North America
 For that, you'll need go Nokia 6120 6300, similar features actually offer 850/1900mhz
 

That`s key word "unlocked"
 I bought one friend lives China
And put Chinese SIM card use phone directly instead recode renew core Chinese display input
About phone , it`s cool
 

Ok, best phone history, I consider one personal favorites
 It two main reasons: one, one I mean one used phone (even once) forgets perfect keys use touch
 Very well designed mentioned another review, navigation text messaging keys wonderful
 The second reason system pretty quick (access one folder another, opening apps, loading sms, etc), unlike nokia models constantly criticized carrying symbian software slow
 The camera plus, it's nothing special, flash way appreciate 2 megapixels camera take picture conditions plenty, I mean plenty, sunlight, otherwise quality photos pretty average
 

Whether it's business pleasure, Nokia 6233 phone gives best worlds
 Get quick access important information via mobile broadband listening favorite music files stereo 3D surround sound speakers
 Write letters go colleagues friends enhanced Java email client
 Connect easily over-the-air office home PC share move information phone
Whether you're taking 2-megapixel quality pictures vacation, sending boss video excerpts last client meeting, Nokia 6233 phone bridges gap business pleasure modern mobile phones
Nokia 6230 actually new generation phone built Series 40 platform; lot new features:- Nokia 6230 compact stylish cell phone
- Color display (65,536 colors, 128 x 128 pixels)- Nokia 6230 6 Mb memory

I going write options phone - read official Nokia web site, but


This phone unusual, beautiful, stylish good reception, works bluetooth
 The minus I point dial lot phone numbers - that's phone you
 It rotator dial rotate every number
 Though program numbers memory use - that's another thing: use bluetooth infrared GPRS transfer numbers current phone, convenient fast
I phone since released Europe I still favorite, I going use long works Nokia's phones work looooong time
 

yes, dial takes getting used to
 u get hang it, becomes easy
 lot people say texting takes long
 agree takes longer keypad, intuitive programming text mode helpful
before buying phone, read every review could find online
 agree, reason u would buy phone styling rather practicality ease use
 however, phone that's supposedly built looks, it's packed features
 sure doesn't support java doesn't come games, decided phone games? reviews complained camera resolution also great, think phone camera it's decent
 besides, don't use phones take pictures
 6 megapixel camera that
summarily, i'd say phone worth every penny
 everything cell phone needs
 dials out, recieves calls (great sound quality reception, btw), voice dial voice activated features, stores contact numbers, date book planner, text messaging multimedia format, et cetera, et al
and oh yeah, mention gorgeously STYLED phone is? thin, lithe, retro-60's chic, pulsing lights, mirror finish screen
 'nuff said
 i'm keeping phone falls apart
 i'm going buy again
 ;-) 

The last commenter valid comments; I'd like add although it's bugger dial little rotary (and text messaging downright akin sending smoke signals), use voice dialing dial
 I use bluetooth headset (Jabra 250V) -- press button headset, phone beeps, say name, plays name back confirmation, dials
 The phone stays backpack pocket whole time
You also download software Nokia manage contacts, numbers, schedules, move around mp3s pictures, create ringtones, lots neat stuff
 You unit's bluetooth
Good points: audio quality reception, speakerphone (LOUD small device) bluetooth, infrared, radio (you need special headset that, included), camera (lousy quality, heck, it's need it), small size (like 2 iPod shuffles), zappo-neat Tron styling glowing buttons
 You hang snapping pop-up earpiece closed
 The perfect hardware use ordering shaken, stirred, beverages
Bad points: Icky dialing operation
 Non-user replaceable battery (though Nokia you; I tested this, customer service GREAT
 Has bit reputation (propogated Nokia marketing) "fashionista" phone
 Mirror ed screen makes seeing screen difficult daylight (which problem since I live Oregon)
 

This phone amazingly wonderfull


 Best Style world
When I want impress someone, I leave Sony Ericsson P910 home (who would imagine that
) change new 7280;The "dial" system amazes everyone (altough it's something get used easyly


)
It's small, it's beautifull, many features


 bluetooth, infrared, more


I would like belt house it


 I find it, I give 5
Sami 

This phone quite unique, need careful it
 If known even slightly rough anything, might want look stout 7380
This phone woman's phone name 'lipstick' probably would safer kept someones purse
 I kept pocket skinny guy, hardly bumping anything, still tends hit hang button alot (thus turning phone)
Also get hands feel entire case feels like thin, almost eggshell like plastic
 It feels breakable, underneath thick metal plate holding mechanics safe
 So even feels like going shatter grip fall apart palm, really need make sure don't scratch plastic
Main flaws phone (for me);~power button raised flush phone (obviously due style), caused accidentally turn phone pocket slightly leaning anything
~rotary dial literally soul phone, mine died
 There seller ebay cheap replacements $17, easy switch out
 But break warranty sticker phone
~my phone random stickers red plastic (once slide open), hard obnoxious remove
 I think phone might refurb
~As sexy 7380, mirror front nice touch makes impossible use outside daylight
~possibly mine, speaker somewhat weak
 It eventually gave sound came side port (speaker phone think)
 I'm typically good personal repairs doubt fix something like easily going stay like that
With mind, remember i'm somewhat physically active guy, moron
 I kept phone safe, refused craving play dial swinging phone back forth (cause sort fun


but DONT
)
 But even caution, keeping pocket eventually damaged dial fact kept turning sort annoying, doing
If looking high tech phone pure style, get this
 If you've ever broken phone actions, look something else
 



























































never worked phone


 kept coming incompatible nokia people said nothing nokia would work
 don't know thatn work


 usually get stuff work
 

Give infinite number monkeys infinite number typewriters, theory goes, eventually produce prose likes Shakespeare
 Well, looks like nokia trying theory handsfree/headphone kits
 And they're nearly there


 quite
Why? oh why? oh why? Do mobile phone manufacturers insist making music capable mobile phones way get fully functional handsfree custom set headphones working mobile? would "designer" "engineer" that? Have ever used devices design? Who knows, eh? Maybe it's universe conspiring make life ever harder ;-)I've got problem reviewer(s) bundled earphones fall ears, moment I can't use phone's music playing features (which really annoying), unless I use standard adaptor for-go really useful handfree mic get "official" headphones
Until I saw headphone


Naturally I assumed headphones would similar quality bundled nokia handfree headphone acceptable
 Unfortunately, headphones aren't good best, add insult injury headphones (just like ones bundled


) don't fit ears properly bud shaped speakers left (by poor ear clip design) facing half ear half out
 Because design (which might able change heating plastic non specification temperatures re-shaping it) virtually bass, tinny sound simply utter rubbish
 In interests scientific testing I also forced ear buds point directly ear sound much better (but still great), unfortunately can't make stay kind pointless
overall? I still maintain monkeys shouldn't make headphones, obviously don't share enough DNA copy design humans
 I suggest stop paying peanuts designs, start getting humans (or even robots?) make headphones
 Even cost cash v's peanuts seems initially high economically unviable, I think public might start buying products approve them
Oh, sorry, went rant
 The headphones? They're crap
 

great idea headphones seeing headphones came 6230 (HDS3) fall ears every 10 seconds hold microphone close mouth


So headphones solve problem great design, clips ears hold place, brilliant clip-on mic/control pad go collar, nice rugged plastic
However wasted plug in


 sound headphones awful, bass, sound balance, subtlety: blaring horrible tinny mids sounds like 50p set headphones christmas cracker
 Should stuck ones fell ears, least sound good


Pointless
 

I Nokia 6620 bought intention acting MP3 player well phone
 I put 1 GB MMC loaded AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne, rock
 Overall, headphones pretty good, though could tad louder
 (You push ear buds ears get louder sound, won't stay there
) I haven't yet made call wearing them, I don't know well mic works
 I think worth price
 I'd rate 4
5 stars I could
 

Dont purchase item


 It's worth listen Mp3
 It supress bass :( 

yep, i'm one annoying peeps talks loud mobile riding tube work, shoot me
btw, great headphones, shame mobile finally died 6 years constant use & abuse 

This nice headset, friends
 They're durable, lightweight, sit comfortably ear provide excellent stereo fidelity, allowing room outside noise


 I'm letter carrier I want still hear what's going around I'm listening radio taking/making calls job
 An around good buy bucks
 

reproduce good stero sound FM part phone yet try mp3 capability
 sound "odd" phone call person's voice ears
 otherwise overall good set
 

I HATE earbud headphones, kept falling I put helmet on, little babies looked like solution listening mp3 player taking calls riding (don't tell dangerous


 loud enough drown ANYTHING
) The upside work really well helmet
 The downside A) still pop-port, maybe gotten 3
5mm adapter
 B) microphone section WAY bulky doestn volume controls


 C) wearing helmet, left one doesnt fit right, dont cauliflower ear anything
 Overall, though, needed
 

I've lots trouble locating headset locally I opted online purchase
 The price good product excellent
 I highly recommend want stereo quality
 

I like product
 The headset comfortable wear sound quality good cost
 











Its kind Dull color
 I would advice checking silver, himalya white instead 













































































This item fit 6126 Antonline refuses waive 15% return fee return shipping cost
 DO NOT DEAL WITH ANTONLINE
 make mistake YOU PAY FOR IT
 

If choose purchase item, extremely careful read fine print
 I bought two weeks ago, thinking would fit Nokia 6133 I (the product title read "TMobile Holster Ratcheting Belt Clip Nokia 6101, 6103/6102i, 6126/6131/6133, 6136") I got it, package states front, clearly, "Designed Nokia 6101, 6103"

This phone great investment me
 I bit worried I didn't know many people it, I glad I bought it
The phone loaded features, dynamic sleek design
 The camera decent
 The bluetooth works really well
 It needs better ring tones
 It also gets great reception really important
 

After I order product send email five days told dont product stock
 R u kidding 


 u check ur stocks u advertise internet charging card
 They return money I needed phone gave one I wasnt able get phone
 That messed I never buy product seller damm life
 I promise it? 

If phone fanatic phone suitable you
 It good features simple user may know phone things
 The fault I found come external memory
 Other nice
 And nokia good battery life
 

Daughter happy Nokia 6126
 Now, little sis demanding one
 Very nice phone
 

I like parts phone, flaws large, I wish I bought different one
 I'm fancy text-messenger want super features, I want phone that's easy use, clock, occasional photo text message
What I like:1
 I like inside layout/buttons
 The buttons inside phone easy see, easy press
2
 Nice bright display inside
3
 Clock display outside panel
What I don't like:1
 The stupid design putting buttons side phone
 You can't pick hold without pressing buttons
 I'm constantly changing volume accidentally turning camera - I change volume back turn camera
 What poor design choice
2
 The battery life
 If don't use phone (like sitting desk), great
 It lasts long time
 But actually talk phone, drains battery like crazy
 I brought I went labor
 After birth, fine
 Full battery charge (according meter) solid dead 1-2 hour conversation sister
3
 Not sure I did, covering lens camera cracked pretty immediately
 I old Nokia bar phone 2 years never cracked
 Maybe something I did, maybe one durable
Anyway, works fine
 I've dropped calls one old Nokia 3220 though
 

This great phone everything I want
 I love button opens phone helpful one-handed use
 The criticism camera button along right side sensitive activated easily fishing phone purse pocket
 This button flush case
 I would rather activate camera opening flip
 Also, profile button side case seems useless open flip actually choose profile
 Otherwise, phone coolio
 

I bought Nokia 6126 December 2006
 It great phone one major flaw
 The internal LCD fragile
 It kind hard surface it
 It's like touching LCD computer monitor
 I phone pocket loose change
 A coin worked way interior screen keypad
 In course hour ruined screen phone work
 I sent repaired wouldn't cover warranty wanted $160
00 repair it
 I told forget it
 I ate cost phone purchased Sony Ericsson W810i
 

We used particular model cell phone years love it
 When one phones died, I pleased I could order new (not used reconditioned) one
 This seller's delivery prompt
 I recommend seller
 

This phone replaced one I already had
 The product arrived early much surprise
 All features phone expected
 The puzzling thing "fido" theme default
 

I nokia phones many years- I love phone- I got FREE upgrade ATT- camera great clear - I problem battery 16 months- recently, I dropped phone numerous times I use headset speakerphone- trying negotiate ATT new contract - usuall pushing much expensive package-walmart also sells unlocked cell phones use sim card- never knew easy cheap- 

I didn't buy seller, maybe he/she somehow found better quality phones I pocket, I doubt it
My intended use piece equipment A PHONE
 I'm sure I would care camera I sound quality
 It's good
 I Nokia 6102i wonderful voice quality
 This one doesn't come close
 Yes, 6102i even available anymore - mine old, I won't give quits working
 If available, I would replace one another one
 I search something replace one with, use phone business want customers able make saying
I return first phone (purchased Radio Shack) - thought something wrong let battery die can't turn unless pull battery put back in
 But one thing
 I wrote manufacturer e-mail didn't respond
 But really sound quality gets me
 I live battery trick
The signal probably average internal antenna phone
 I carry both, 6102i MUCH better signal
My suggestion - shop around little more
 Only get phone Nokia give free
 Don't pay it
 Nokia makes good stuff
 I point I won't phone isn't Nokia
 I've carrying 15 years
 But one definately best work
 That is, looking PHONE camera, music player, nice display
 If care about, check reviews address things, I don't care them
 

Received phone time,nice phone updated miro card 2gb
 Dont use internet,music player sounds great,camera great
 I add T-mobile minutes good
 Very nice phone money,I nothing bad say it
 It`s first phone owned
 Later i`am going get bluetooth head set,speaker phone works great
 Nice phone i`am happy it
 

I found phone quite nice
 The speaker phone quite loud, screen large bright
 The button flip phone open one hand usefull, although I dont know yet durable is
 I bought phone especially quad band, good international coverage travelling, speaker phone looked like good Nokia clam shell
 I happy functions
 The battery drains quickly use speakerphone (as models) would good keep spare
 

I'm Nokia fan
 Always buy nokia phone
Have 2 these
 Same problems both
First - what's paint????It started peeling week, leaving ugly scrapes traces paint
 Okay - I could live that, I peeled totally
Now looks ugly
 Period
Now I can't hear well
 It's - it's phone
So looking new one replace
Ai ai ai NOKIA



bad one
 

The Nokia 6126 Pros:texting keypad fastexternal screen bright largekeys slightly raised good tactile feelExcellent Internal Screen resolution color depth
Press button openSlim enough shirt pocketReliable call signalMusic player used multi-tasking phone operations without slowing software
When using headphones Nokia adapter, audio quality good
Micro SD slot back cover, don't remove battery
Pairs well Bluetooth devicesFast power power timesNokia 6126 Cons:poor placement exterior, volume - power - camera - rocker buttons, tactile enough feel, visually find times
Needs side access micro SD cardno back light timer adjustmentBattery talk time standby time good
Navigation speed menu O
K
 Faster Motorola, slower Samsung
Speaker phone audio quality good phones
 (High frequency audio drop off) Speaker volume O
K
Ear piece volume slightly low, needs centered right spot ear canal hear
Camera photo quality good, (video noise)Using low light option seems reduce video noise expense slow shutter speed
Still image color accurate
Can't categorize music play lists 

I received phone brother (he used work Nokia Texas) phone broke (nokia 6102i) contract Cingular another year (yeah, sucks)
Background: I eligible upgrade yet, meant I purchase phone retail price (without contract) would run upwards $300 more
 So I got phone (unlocked) gift, switch-over relatively easy trouble-free
 I copied address book 6102i onto SIM card, I moved SIM card 6126, address book (taa-daa
)
 What I able move photos I snapped old phone
 Those I send via email, I saved onto microSD card able move 6126 (it microSD slot, read 1Gb card easily)
Features: I always liked Nokia
 This phone exception (except one I discuss later)
 It clam (ie
 flip) phone almost slim (but slightly lighter than) Motorola RAZR
 I like menu layout Nokia
 The camera 1
3 Megapixel resolution (settings 1,024x1,280, 960x1,290, 600x800, 480x640, 240x320, 120x160)
 The photos decent daylight, great poorly-lit areas (but goes every camera phone I've ever encountered)
I like black silver coloring
 No external antenna (sweet)
 The button side open extra (not necessary)
 The internal display nice large, colorful
 I like navigation keypad
 The textured covering rear flap different (I like it, 50-50 friends)
There plenty hands-free features
 There's speakerphone, loud enough used outside, Bluetooth connecting headset sending files, well voice dialing commands
 There POP3 IMAP4 e-mail support, audio messaging sending voicemails directly another cell phone, USB cable support (I haven't used yet)
There large 1,000-contact phone book room entry five phone numbers, e-mail Web addresses, job title company name, work home street addresses, birth date, etc
 The SIM card hold additional 250 names
 Other extras include standard stuff: vibrate mode, text multimedia messaging, calculator, voice recorder, calendar reminders, notepad, stopwatch, alarm clock
Hands-free features plentiful, well
 There's full Bluetooth connecting headset sending files, plus voice dialing commands speakerphone
 For hard-core emailers, also POP3 IMAP4 e-mail support
I tested quad-band GSM phone San Francisco/Bay Area using existing Cingular wireless service
 I got quality old Nokia 6102i phone
 Call quality decent
Now, negatives
 A minor drawback design MicroSD card slot located behind battery cover
 Although, don't need remove battery itself, need remove cover
 My beef battery life
 The 6126 rated talk time 3
4 hours promised standby time 10 days
 When I maxed talk time, I got 3
5 3
75 hours talk-time (impressive)
 Because I always phone, hard guage standby time
 However, I paired activated Bluetooth, connected Nokia BH-900 earpiece (By way, BH-900 earpiece sub-standard compared Motorola HS850, another review altogether) I got feeling battery life standby
 For half day minimal use (20 min max), standby rest day battery 20-25% capacity
 When I turned Bluetooth, I able go full day use still 50% battery capacity
 So seems Bluetooth feature activated eating battery juice (which makes sense)
 I yet find control tells phone automatically turn Bluetooth active device around
Conclusion: The Nokia 6126 nice phone many features
 I gate 4-stars battery life
 This must, especially frequent traveler (like me) use phone/Bluetooth earpiece lot
 Nokia improve battery life, easily done patch automatically turn Bluetooth Bluetooth devices around
 

I bit phone nut love Nokia products
 After using Nokia 6230b Cingular Detroit Virgin Mobile England 2 years, I decided, Nokia offers quad-band phone, time upgrade
Phone arrived time seemed like quality piece
 Beautiful screen, well put together, etc
 I used days charging cycles
 Here I found:-Very poor battery life
 I could go whole day charge heavy use-Very poor call quality
 I could carry converstation people sound would cut out, ever full signal
 I swapped SIM back old 6230b everything fine
-You need position phone right ear cannot hear caller end all
-I learned I really like flip phone (why phone flip anyways?)-Don't really like ultra small signal battery meters-I like Nokia's original test message input interface better new setup 6126So, I returned phone
 Amazon great work I got credit quickly
 I buy again
Yes, possible phone faulty handset, causing bad call quality I want go hassel getting another one
 Plus, negative told phone me
Plus, whole experience reminded candy bar 6230b one Nokia's best phone ever (just needs quad-band)


Now I need search quad-band candy bar Nokia replace 6230b


eventually



 Maybe Nokia E50


 

Got phone brand new like $180
 It's sweet
It's stylish (It look way better appearred default image
)It's powerful (Web surfing, built-in MP3 player-very good quality)
It's handy (You sync computer get images, tones, wallpapers, screensavers, etc
 free
 Unlike many phones bound carrier, allow purchase carrier outrageous price)
The price high
 But well-worth it
 It's quad-band
 It's great international travelers
 You aint bound 2-year lengthy contract (ones terminated, would charge like 200 bucks T-Mobile)
 Unlocked phones pay-as-you-go phones
 No future fees
Some people complain poor battery life
 I think change battery
 Chances may defective
Hmm, anything else? Oh yeah, phone everyone-has-one kind phone like Motorola RAVZ, enjoy cool
Very good reception
 I always 5-bar signal
Very good voice quality
 You don't even use speakerphone normal mode loud enough
The phone decent-budget one considered it's high-end users phone
 Among family, 6131 better (only radio feature added, less), radio ridiculously expensive, you'll pay like 40 bucks (for what? radio? Hello?)
 The 6133, everyone know, disaster it's crippled T-Mobile
 The 6126 no-brainer
And last least
 It's Nokia
 

First I really like new phone, take get used Motorola's last 4 years
 Battery life universal complaint reason 4 stars
Cingular AT&T; customers forwarned, company like buy unlocked phones
 Customer service stinks
 I could send multimedia messages informed since I buy them, could nothing
 And phone junk, send back buy them
 I researched phone make sure compatable area sold also( $50 $100 more) unlocked
Thanks AMAZON rep
 I referred Nokia website I phone running less minute
 Thank amazon
 Nokia website great also
 Cingular-GET OVER IT
 This one many reasons I never renew contract company
I work home mother 2
 Not tech savvy, trying keep up
 Love text MM message
 But mainly got phone camera satisfied
 

Suncom network Fayetteville, NC call quality 28314 EXCELLENT
 period
 inside display BRILLIANT


i mean upload photographs display photo realistic 24bit (16 million- One byte (eight bits) per channel gives 256 (28) intensites channels gives 16,777,216 colors pixel (often approximated 16 million despite fact it's closer 17 million)
 The human eye popularly believed capable discriminating many 10 million colors
 ever wanted carry personal photos digital camera show awsome need buy usb adaptor cable separetly best buy time
 Infrared


but cable cheap like 6 bucks


also ahve buy micro SD card 2 gb storage
ok made phone else sound loud is


even hookup jabra BT250v BT150 SO LOUD lower volume rocker 


and speakerphone god


also run symbian s60 3rd edition really fast


compared last NOKIA 6230i


which issues


but call quality great


now worst part


the batter talk time really reported 3 hours something



so talk alot get car travel expect least plug every day


i love mainly awsome internal screen


and sound quality

the camera better cousins motorola razor good old nokia 6230i


i know 1
3 megapixels reason equal



lets see Tmobile version 6133 reported 48 polyphonic sounds vs version 64
 version doesnt fm radio infrared
 want 6131 european version it


but european spec model battery charger bulky needs 220 adaptor(cheap)well great phone think also better sony w810i used loaner phone


speakerphone quality sound quality could TOUCH THE NOKIA 6126


I SWEAR IT


NOT TO MENTION screen


couldnt come close


 

Two month update: Battery capacity really pathetic
 Lucky I go two days without charge light usage conditions
 With calls day plan charging every day
 If I again, I'd get phone like Moto V235 wife got - much, much better battery life
Three month update: Black rubberized paint phone peeling off
 Expect happen phones
 Definitely like Moto V235 better
 Its much durable
The 6126 nice voice phone upgrade - providing use less hour per day
 It bright display, tactile large buttons elegant style
 Voice quality quite good reception transmission
 And menu easily customized quickly get features often used
 Signal sensitivty seems good old Nokia 3595 well designed phone
 It also acceptable occassional web surfing MP3 player usage
What phone not:For heavy web usage - battery capacity display size small
 Get IPhone equivalent large screen display device
For constant music playing - battery small
For someone hearing vision issues - icons print font size quite small making hard see
 The alarms phone rings aren't loud meaning may hear phone pocket/purse noisy environment
 The battery vibrator help
 This phone discret usage like quite restaurant
 Reception voice level isn't loud turn speakerphone loud enough
For constant conversational use Bluetooth - battery life issue
For someone looking Mil Spec durabilty - inside screen hard protective cover making susceptible damage thrown purse pocket small hard items floating around
 While phone seems well constructed, I wouldn't chance dropping often
 This elegant device like fine watch
Similar sports car, 6126 limited number things exceptionally well - high maintenance doesn't range functionality minivan
 And $190 quite expensive voice phone replacement really doesn't compete true smart phone device
 (I got mine $60
)I like fact SIM card Micro SD protected back cover
 It may entail one step access, often really need pull either?To get best use phone make sure turn power saving features make good use menu short cuts avoid lengthy periods bright screen on
 This really eats battery life
One point, make sure lock keyboard use
 This way buttons side phone don't activate various features leading even shorter battery life unintended usage
And finally don't hold phone bottom
 That antenna you'll degrade signal sensitivity battery life hand
 Hold hinge area phone
Expect 2 days battery life maybe one hour phone usage per day
 Get car charger less $10
 It cheap insurance ensure charge
 

I liked Nokia 6126 phone month ago
 This second 6126 phone AT&T; 2 years
 The first black paint around touch pad flake off
 That minor
 The replacement lasted year two screens (inside outside) went crazy
 Sometimes color wrong, rotated image 90 degrees
 Now time image, gray dark blue
 I tried rebooting routine 


 taking battery 


 
 No good
 Sometimes shaking works
Now frustrating I answer incoming calls
 Phone works, can't see screen
 I love Nokia
 The last Sony I had, died white screen death
 Now Nokia 6126 life support
 I'm tired AT&T; sticking (free) phone craps out
 I don't need camera, internet, music, qwerty keyboard
 Just reliable phone???? 

I've model phone year now
 When I say MODEL phone, it's I've replace twice
 This phone suffers MANY bugs, notably:- The screen freezes says "operation failed" I try take pictures (this happened phones)
- Generally poor voice quality
 On 1st phone, I quiet, 2nd one, I sound like I'm anonymous tipster "Dateline" - voice garbled one understand me
- Can't send picture messages - phone restarts (has happened phones)
- Camera displays black green, everything looks horrible
This phone cheap I got it, I regret it
 Don't fall trap
 

Nokia enhances S40 interface Version 3 I pleased it
 The push-to-open button side handy screens beautiful
 The camera 1
3 megapixels works well phone, I would recommend buying Micro SD card storing few, internal memory limited
 Works great Bluetooth modem EDGE service T-Moblie using Macs PCs
 My complaint device audio quality, occasional pops clicks
 Other that, it's good phone overall
 


Actually, I bought phone mistake, since I thought wouldn't shipped way Colombia, (in less seven days)
 To point I bought books Amazon trying buy products failed due shipping restrictions, although Amazon reseller E-tronics came time
 Great job guys
Ok, brass tax: Nokia N73 ME complete multimedia experience, camera, music player, yes phone, complete extras, led sell old iPod last week
 And since I didn't camera, fantastic
 The camera works great (for phone), although, become wiz adjusting settings comes packed picture come great environments little light
 I'm totally psyched it, shooting everything moves
 The Symbian OS well designed pretty robust, supporting kind application might find
The downside beginning little slow browsing applications
 But fix problem downloading Nokia Software Updater allows update phone's firmware
 I updated N73 latest version (v
4
0727
2
2
1) problem solved, along dozens bugs
 And sync Nokia PC Suite it's like office pocket
 Really is
OK buddy, that's now
 Hats Nokia making awesome phone
 Your bank account might get pissed off, life definitely improve: life there
 Oh, best childish unfounded need coveted iPhone gone
 Righty Oh
 

I've used N75 phone Cingy/AT&T; year phone uses Symbian 3rd ed OS
 So I still gripes but

The differences I like phone:-Awesome camera resolution
 Really digital camera-like
 Even indoor night pictures w/ flash came great
 Most people think it's camera way looks give weird look ask take picture 


 hand phone
-Better battery life N75-I thought I'd problem smaller keypad area I actually text quicker keys closer together responsive
-the keypad phone (except screen) doesn't attract fingerprints much N75-speakers sound fuller teeny-more themes ringtones branded N75-lighter N75-easier sim card accessThe Cons:-I've gotten used flip style screen exposed made think twice shoving pockets
-joystick easy get used to
In words, awesome awesome phone
A little pricey well worth it
 Get it
 

This phone let down
 The reception full bars always(like Nokia phones)
 The pictures blow away friends phones
 The music options cool
 Just put like 8 hours music phone even dent memory
 This phone worth every penny

 










































































































































































FANTASTIC PRICE
 Fast shipping
 Worked expected
 Can't ask anything else company
 Would definitely recommend future purchases


 





Cellet case worked great Nokia E61i - fit snug - large
 I also tried Krusell cases - Cellet favorite
 It NOT show keyboard screen belt, phone worn horizontal
 Phone easily removed pushing phone slot bottom case
The Krusell (Classic 89251) clear plastic front, fit well - displays phone face worn vertically
 This classic would choice back pack purse, use belt - traveling via city train stations - I want phone display
 The Krusell Pictor (94115) disappointing overly Large
 The E61i swam Pictor case additional space accessories, etc
No problems Cellet far, 3 weeks traveling it
 

This first case I bought try new Nokia E61i I lucked out
 Didn't really want spend $60 nice leather case
 This one easy use feels comfortable side
 Fits phone snug, snug
 Can't beat one
 Not sure material leather, sure feels like it
 

It small nokia e61, fits tight, needs two hands put out
 I ended using iphone, fits well it
 

Nifty little case case Nokia E61/E62
 This first belt-clip cell phone holster I surprised well worked
 It swivel horizontal (where I keep it) vertical
 The magnetic clasp also nice touch
 The glove leather better quality I expected

Bough car charger second car

Used hours time road
Highly recommend it
 

When I purchased phone didn't get car charger
 I wanted see I could find one online good price
 I decided buy one wife I

This charger job & costs little , I can't see wouldn't get one two - goes items seller ; fact I called indoor 120/220 volt charger I got wrong model & simply mailed correct one & want/need return original one I got - No better service find 
 

The cord bit short situation, charger working expected
 The price great
 I used charge cell phone twice problems
 



Somehow I "lost" charger Nokia 6030 cell phone
 Certainly didn't want pay lot replacement
 This GREAT CHARGER perfect
 LIGHTWEIGHT
 Very LOW PRICE
 Works PERFECTLY
 Works MANY OTHER MODELS well
 (See PRODUCT description models it's compatible
) Works HOME (and that's I wanted
) HIGHLY recommend


 Of course, I found charger week I received one
 LOL
 Isn't goes? At least I SUPER "extra" one now
 

This charger works well
 It anything special, job
 The nice part it, works many different Nokia phones
 There different Nokia phones family, works them
 

I ordered sent back charger twice
 I gave right model number phoneand never able get correct charger it
 

Was pleasantly suprised given low cost item
 So far worked like charm
 Construction quality nothing scream I need sit kitchen counter charge three year old spare phone
 For worked great
 For travel light would good perspective I don't think would take much wear tear
 

I 3 weeks now
 Does charger ought do
 I use Nokia 6030
 Charging takes around 5 hours get full charge (slower original charger)
 But I don't mind, considering it's price AWESOME

 

I needed new charger older Nokia phone found great price thru Amazon
 




This simple device expected one thing - charge cell phone traveling vehicle
 It job problems
 It nice long cord, larger devices I've used, easy handle
 It "pilot" light show operating, useful information case truck charging continues engine off, car, power accessory outlet engine off
 



































I've phone good 2 years, it's everything imagine
 I've dropped water, I've dropped ground, neighbor's Rottweiler got ahold it, ex flung car window 25mph



 It's held everything
I work construction, heating a/c side things
 So normal work day consists climbing attic space 2 story houses BEFORE sheetrock, jumping trusses
 I dropped phone second floor open-space cement foundation accident numerous times
 As imagine balancing 2X4's, 25 feet ground, talking phone isn't trait everybody born with


me included
 The damage phone sustained cracked plastic protective cover sunk-in power button, along pretty severe scratches
 But I'll tell what, new flea-market "El-Cheapo" plastic shell, still runs like champ
If work noisy environment like I way go
 I use ringtone called "Low" (heh, go figure) loudest setting I hear jackhammers pounding pavement outside doorless, windowless, acoustic, empty houses I work in
 Just don't go sleep next phone close head
The battery takes good two three days asks recharged, normal use course
 My teenage bro, I'm sure many teenager, run full charge day
It's small
 It's VERY durable
 It's cheap
 It's simple
 A working man's phone
 I'm going hold onto mine I find another phone take beating, looks like company outside Nextel really cares much durability anymore
 If need extra backup phone case newfangled "Motorola 29LDOI: Atomic Warhead Explosion Particle Calculating Edition" phone breaks someone sneezes it, pick little gem up
 You can't fail
 

I long time Cingular customer, fourth Nokia phone
 I came 6340i, I 3595 couple days
 The 3595 buzzy, overall feeling cheapness it, that's I got 6340i
 Anyway, I got 6010 huge improvement 3595 replaces
 It clearest sound quality cell phone I ever heard
 In fact, clearer portable phone I used well
 People end report hear crystal clear
The phone nice heft solidity I find attractive
 The styling color really nice, buttons well laid good solid feel
 I like fact phone simply phone
 No camera, camcorder, PDA, etc
 All I want inexpensive phone durable allows nice conversation someone
 The Nokia delivers spades
 I pleased Nokia 6010
 

I recently switched T-Mobile Cingular I loved little Samsung R225 phone
 The problem service area prevented using phone house
 I went different places everyone told Nokia way go I wanted really good reception
 Okay, I took bait
 Instead taking free Sony Eriksson phone I paid extra $20 got Nokia 6010
 What mistake
 The phone hallow sound it
 It's like I hear everything around echoing phone
 There place put wrist strap may problem men wear belts problem me
 I take phone strap old phone open back Nokia 6010, insert strap put case back hope doesn't break phone strap stays put
 There way get rid "Cingular" shows screen
 On old phone I could put anything I want banner
 Mind you, may way, blocked (Option 3 Phone Settings menu conspicuously missing)
 The display screen dark can't read time way change it
 Hey, here's novel idea, providing ring tones addition many song rings us prefer traditional ring
 What happened normal ring tone? I don't want meeting "Futurisco" playing
 The one thing I give phone ability create Profiles make changes settings apply particular group settings depending situation
 Overall, I greatly disappionted
 

I bought phone Amazon
com Cingular
 It good phone, terms receiption simplicity
 No fancy features
 But still good basic phone
I one question 6010 Amazon
com: come accessories, like earphone, etc? The package I received includes phone, battery
 That all
No earphone
 Could anybody confirm accessory phone amazon? 

I live moderate desolate area distance tower
 This phone connect indoors
 I tried mobile antenna roof find adapter velcro connection absolutely gives nothing $15
 My old basic Nokia pretty good hookup mechanical earphone style hookup

I'm looking good basic phone, loud ringtones plug style antenna

In today's day age, it's becoming normal thing kids cell phones, I wanted get part I bad remarks added comment here
 I ten year old daughter uses Nokia 6010 phone KIC prepaid plan two us stay touch she's activities, friends' houses, neighborhood since 2-way radios go far
 One things I didn't want clip attach pants fear losing phone
 So keeps pants pocket
 Then happened
 I thought I going faint first I pay $100 phone since wasn't contract she's using for
 She left phone pants pocket washer went
 After full super wash All Clean Clear bit Snuggle's fabric softner, I'm sure phone quite clean now
 We realized missing I called kept telling customer unavailable
 Then said words, "Mom, take phone pocket, I left there
"My personal experience dropping cell phone toilet, I knew phone goner, I hope
 I took phone apart let dry night, put back together, believe phone still works like new??? The Sim card wasn't even damaged


So know washes good, rest phone? It comes preloaded several ringtones, none sounded like Ciara daughter wanted, downloaded free ringtone site use
 Ah, see? It DOES internet capabilities
 It also games play, Bowling loud, I times want smash it, haha, learned turn volume
 The candybar style phones, one, much easier slip pocket one teeny booper purses uses flip phones, I feel phone perfect her
 It doesn't camera anything, basics
 If you're looking phone talk on, one work fine
 I've used test sound crystal clear hard find brands
 You buy interchangeable face plates leave black
 Overall, it's good little phone I regret purchase
 

This good cell phone Amazon

 But, can't transfer old phone number different provider Cingular Amazon
com
 If transfer old phone number, won't get mail-in rebate
 Please read amazon

This first try cell phone I told type get absolute best reception
 My daughter LG flip phone go outside house talk hers
 I sit anywhere house talk mine, I guess means I told correctly
 My complaint one options cingular really phone itself
 I set mine "pay go" I aol instant messenger home pc
 well, apparently it's showing I online time phone service IM anyone computer sees "online" pc, try instant message me, automatically alerts phone charges five cents
 I process trying get straightened far nothing working
 

I pulled 6010 laundry machine, second time
 After letting dry sun hours, sprang back life, second time
 Combine times I've dropped shaken it, it's one heck survivor
 It still original battery that
 Color impressed
 

I Razr lasted 2 weeks
 It rugged enough apparently
 Cingular, I hate, told cheapest phone 199
00
 I went ebay found gem 25
00
 The reception great I actually hear rings
 Try Razr Slyvr anyother overpriced name cute name
 I use bad boy contract Cingular expires I going somewhere else
 AT&T Wireless wasn't bad me, Cingular bunch Aholes 

If use cell phone phone, good choice
 No camera limited instant messaging support help camera follow KISS rule
But it's cheat doesn't mean poor quality
 Mine managed surive day snowbank
 When I manage lose 6010, I replaced (you guessed it) another 6010
 

iv phone 1 yr still going strong
 picks signal others wont
i dont like fact dosent speaker phone
 overall great basic cell phone durable too
 

Yes
You talk phone
 It decent reception
 Extremely big fonts even blind people see big hard lose it
 The battery mine sucks though


I need watch I talk two hours time:) With additional features


this phone awesome won't keep occupied perform well job
 I sony ericcson man, something own


I checked cousin's Motorola V600 SO USER UNFRIENDLY compared basic Sony Ericcson T610
 The camera video recording functions amazing though
 So, wanna talk worry phone (except charging bit though), buy 6010, want take pictures, record videos worry using phone talk, go V600
 Hope review useful
 

The phone actually disappointment
 The color screen VERY hard read outdoors even indoors unless lighting dim
 The rings quiet - even maximum setting
 Other that, phone OK
Cingular plays stealth service plan game - tried tack 'roadside assistance' plan (I never agreed plan) nerve say removing plan courtesy
 They also failed apply govt employee discount 

The Nokia 6010 I chose Cingular (AT&T) prepaid service 2005
 I used three months let sit 8 months
 I already different phone another company's contract plan
 My 6010 problems holding charge charger 8 months
 I liked reliability 6010 much I let contract plan go
 I don't use cell phone much, I like $1/day usage plus $0
10/minute prepaid plan good one year $100 prepayment
 I pleasantly surprised find unused balance didn't vanish I renewed end year
 The per minute charge doesn't apply weekends calls customers company
 The lack roaming means calls local, charged dollar day usage plus ten cents per minute remaining balance
 I think paying extra roaming great
 The clarity absolutely excellent even I'm traveling along highway, call someone side country
 The problem I've encountered phone Cingular/ATT
 I've found people several stores totally clueless
 It hired one minute I walked in
 They didn't know transfer old number, activate prepaid card, features plans were, probably things I've forgotten
 They also didn't care long kept waiting made personal calls chatted amongst themselves
 If find Cingular/ATT store like that, I do, find another company store people know stuff take customer service seriously
 The know-nothings told I could check remaining balance calling number gave me
 Not true, works contract plans
 Fortunately, several months ago Cingular/ATT started sending remaining balance phone's display calls
 

If you're wedded folding-style, excellent phone
 Perhaps best thing keypad: dialing numbers almost easy home phone
 You also store multiple phone numbers single name "tag" one little icon lets know it's home, mobile, work, etc
 You add "voice tag" 10 numbers choice: hold contacts button full second, speak person's name, phone automatically dials number
 The sound quite good cell phone
 The battery decent long life needs recharging
 A small rubber pad built back phone prevents sliding lying hard surfaces
 The criticism--and it's small one--is there's quick way (at least none I've found) put phone vibrate alert (like pressing holding "#" key, e
g
)
 You go Menu-Profiles-Silent-Select (which much trouble, would nice quicker way it)
 

This phone color upgrade previous Nokia 6340
 The 6340 great phone (it survived numerous drops without problems), black/green screen hard read, especially night
The 6010 screen color, bright
 It's 1/2" shorter 6340 (4
5" long)
 The build quality 6010 good 6340, acceptable
One key point 6010 bluetooth, IR, connectivity cable included
 You'll buy 3rd party software/cables connect phone computer
Since old phone different cellphone system, I new SIM card
 I therefore re-enter old phone #'s new phone manually
The 6010 connects internet GPRS, apparently available area
 My old 6340 problems connecting internet
As phone, better battery life(very good), call, signal quality 6340
 Which reason I'm keeping 6010
 But users looking multiple functions look elsewhere
 

An excellent, inexpensive phone want latest features DON'T need camera
 Supports games, polyphonic ringtones, wireless internet, IM
 The phone plenty memory contacts extras
 It great signal strength far, two weeks use (Cingular Seattle)
 The battery long-lasting even 1st charge
Some cons:This phone little bulky - slightly thicker deck cards - boxy
The keys hard solid; extensive game-playing long text messages give sore thumbs
 The keys hard press use fingernails (they "rock" without engaging), big enough hit fingertips
 It easy mistakenly hit 8 instead 5
The screen difficult read backlight off, light turns quickly (15 seconds, doesn't seem way change setting)
 The screen stays lit games
This NEW phone (Sept 2004), yet many games available
 I also seen 3rd-party content providers (for ringtones, etc
) support yet
Since isn't flip-phone, keylock important, dedicated button, onscreen instructions
 (The keypad locked hitting * main menu
)-- -- --Despite drawbacks, I happy purchase
 Don't buy games (difficult play/few available), features excellent
 (


) 

Pro: Just good basic "stick" phone like everyone else saying, great battery life (at least mine does), nice user interface -- easy setup address book
 I'd buy again
Con: (1) Very "hot" magnetically -- make LOUD pops, hums, chirps squeals nearby powered speakers (hey -- tell call coming in
), jiggle nearby CRT monitors
 Much phone I've owned
 It's like it's really trying hard reach out
(2) Display hard read ambient light -- push button bring back-light, "undo" whatever pushing button
 This phone NOT need color display -- LCD wristwatch easily readable light, phone
(3) Buttons well placed -- especially upper two "soft" buttons
 

Someone family lost cell phone bus (to protect guilty, I remain silent) needed replacement phone
 We decided Nokia 6010 basically cost concerns
 The phone price range
 Here first impressions phone:Form Factor: This yet another 'candy bar' phone
 It oblong shape cover
 The buttons flush-flat backlit soft glow button touched phone call coming in
 The unit slimmer design it's low cost cousins made plastic
 The phone slippery need phone cover butter fingered
Reception: Pretty good
 The sensitivity little bit better average
Sound Quality: Odd
 When testing phone out, caller receiving call end mentioned Nokia's broadcast sounded like somebody talking inside tunnel
 Lots echo
 Strange
Display: Passing
 The screen bright enough see moderate bright light
 The images look little chunky color could saturated
 But overall, bad
Ring Tones: Comes good variety ringtones
 This model polyphonic sounding ringtones
 This fancy way saying sounds stereo-like quite full
 Pretty entertaining
Navigation: If used Nokia before, adjust menu system without much trouble
 However, newcomers find menus/submenus bit daunting non-logical
 Read manual help
 The Nokia menus allow enter new phone numbers, activate 1-touch dialing, set ring tones volume, play games, set screen image, etc
Overall Impression: Pretty nice basic phone
 I rate phone 4
 

This phone totally great
 It gets signal well
 It work almost anywhere
 It sturdy, though rather heavy big
 It color screen, isn't bright vivid, kind washed out
 If want basic phone talk phone work you
 

This decent phone
 To me, main requirements good reception decent phone book (imagine - I want use cell phone
), I complaints items
 But another reviewer said, goes crazy magnetically
 When it's computer, monitor looks like it's LSD, speakers make random techno music
 I idea Nokia managed get FCC certification phone
 ;-) If weren't EMI stuff, I would give 5 stars
 

I got phone offering promo 1000 anytime minutes (comparable Nation 450 plan otherwise) national GSM network i'm good customer, I wanted jump GSM bandwagon soon started getting rid TDMA towers, could accrue benefits plan longer
 The phone almost exactly like TDMA Nokia 3560 phone
 Just intro, i've mostly Nokia stick phones
PROS: (compared NOkia 3560
 None really
 I nation wide roaming versus previous regional plan, peak time longer 7AM-8PM
 It web browsing capabilities (which don't phone), I believe download music, wallpapers, games, although couldn't 3560
 I've gone 3 Nokia stick phones, main reason chose one samsung camera E317 flip phone $50 extra batteries, AC adaptors, earphone, car adaptor, case previous Nokias
 Oh yeah, also display DATE well time phone, useful me, wouldn't know month without digital watch, don't wear
CONS:1)the buttons pretty hard push, especially ones near top
 The "send" left "choice
?" button way close, "end call" right button
 Exactly similar phones? Well, jsut switched faceplates use old 3560 phone faceplate, works fine
2)Couple reviews mentioned hollow sound heard person you're talking to
 noticed whereas 3560 hole case near microphone, 6010 not
 Not sure much difference make - can't really make good comparison, it's 2 different networks
3)Had discussion friend today, lamenting cell phone companies may purposefully give regular sounding ring, you'll purchase one
 Yes, 6010 doesn't really traditional rings
 prefer sounds little bit low pitch, good volume, definitely melodious cutesy, isn't fits criteria phone
4)earpiece loud - I'm somewhat paranoid EM radiation, use headset whenever possible, even lowest volume setting, it's TOO LOUD
 keep telling person speak softly
 i've holding earpiece near ear hands counteract this, kind defeats point hands-free
 even without ear piece, phone loud
 hold far ear, allows random strangers hear we're taling about
 3560, "equalizer" function could set base volume lower begin with, change volume base
 available 6010
 I'm actually thinking getting crappiest earpiece find mutes volume somewhat
5)also phone voice recorder function, didn't really use, fun
All all, i'm unhappy phone
 don't really like flip phones, preach volumes durability nokia stick phones (ran 2nd nokia phone - LCD messed up, otherwise working fine)
 My big beef conversation loud


 I dunno, maybe sensitive ears something
 maybe new genearation screwed ears loud music heavy use headphones turned loud, nokia adapting times
 (kind like movie theaters nowadays, seems like


)after all, don't think hearing got better got older, right? 

I run fleet six cellphones family currently includes 3 tough, entry level phones
 My kids capable killing nicer phones, hard time Nokia 6010
 It's basic GSM phone works like tank
 There's speakerphone, texting features (predictive want it) fine (kids text)
 The cool thing kid happens destroy drown phone, try salvage SIM card, grab another phone used online (may require unlocking, difficult), plug SIM card running again
 I've done three times now
 It takes full immersion devastating fall kill phone
 I've used one phones awhile (while I setting daughter)
There tons aftermarket accessories phone, they'll around awhile yet
 

With owners new-fangled cell phones bells whistles them, many people pretty surprised see pull antique (in terms cell phone technology anyway)
 No special screen
 No picture capabilities
 Just Plain-Jane ol' cell phone
 Yep
 Suits fine
I get great reception
 A great basic service plan
 And I still original battery sucker
 Can believe that? Most people can't
 But it's true
 I swear
 I've dropped half-a-dozen times, too, keeps working
 Amazing little guys
 My little snoogy phone
 Yes


my itty-bitty, little snoogy phone
 I love snoogy phone
 Yes I do
 I love you


 




















































































Overall I'm impressed
 Ergonomics, usability, screen/brightness fantastic
 Speakerphone best I ever heard phone, ever
Voice quality initially quite poor, I traced back older SIM card
 **UPGRADE YOUR SIM CARD
** Now voice quality acceptable 98% time
 The times I hang call back
I gave 4 stars following issues
 Hopefully fixed future firmware upgrades:1
 WiFi work unless SSID broadcast
 It simply associate otherwise
 ('Hidden' mode broken
)2
 WiFi work WPA2-Enterprise (using certificates)
 Certs loaded, credentials always fail
 WPA2-Personal workaround I employed
3
 Integrated on-ear speaker (NOT speakerphone) quiet
 I cannot hear party I'm loud moving vehicle noisy room
 I use Bluetooth headset in-air speaker accommodate
Finally, note Web/XML browser: awesome
 I extremely pleased presentation, especially Javascript heavy sites
 I like far better Opera Symbian
 Oh, games
 Come on, Nokia

This great price, worked old nokia phone, great, since phone doesn't take off-brand headsets
 Thank you
 

I RELY ON MY HEADSET AT WORK, AND WHEN MY HEADSET WENT BAD I WENT TO THE TELEPHONE STORE AND WAS TOLD THEY NO LONGER SELL IT, THATS WHEN MY HUSBAND TOLD ME TO GO AMAZON
 COM TO FIND WHATEVER I NEED
 THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SAVING THE DAY
 

Ordered three $1
69 ($5
07)
 Shipping $2
98 well ($8
94) came packaged together small padded mailer
 So, even though I think price shipping ridiculous, it's tough complain I knew checkout ordered anyway
 The earbuds work great Nokia 6030 we're happy them
 The nice thing earbuds don't recharge them
 

Cannot go wrong product
 Purchased headset Nokia 2610
 Earpiece sounds great
 All I speak surprised I speaking mic headset instead phone
 The answer/end button mic great feature especially driving
 Great price fast shipping
 

This second head set it's comfortable earbuds go
I enjoyed contact company came quickly new
 

I bought worked reviewers nokia phones, unfortunately didn't work nokia phone
 I didn't ask company send replacement since another reviewer still didn't work
 I bought one Target ($15) works fine
 So, bottom line may may work phone
 

I don't always best luck earpieces, I've one several months, now, I really like it
 The sound clear, person end
 It fits ear doesn't shift around
 It seems durable; I haven't dropped puddle yet, I cram purse regularly gently abused still works fine
 

Great affordability
 Obtained Amazon matter days earbud working perfectly
 

It works fine, even came nice foam cover earpiece
 I hear fine, people side conversation say reception fuzzy static filled
 

After shopping locally headset 6030 Nokia cell phone, I found store town carried these
After search Amazon
com, I placed order Webtreo
I received earboom, instead earbud headset,which work well glasses
I received response e mail within 30 minutes, correct earbud within 5 days, along return postage mail back Nokia earboom
Even paying postage, price Nokia product less I'd paying aftermarket product
Definitely business Webtreo again
 

All I say headset works, almost point well
 I got fiance loves it
 Easy use, microphone amazing
 It pick said movie phone time
 Again, great item
 Enough Said
 

works great
 button mic bud answer calls
 earpiece foam cover wearing easy ear
 Mic picks well


not good idea use noisy spot

but know phone
 cord high quality resist breakage
 4 contact plug
 Very handy


always stays plugged phone
 

Not lot say except doesn't work well Nokia 1661 phone
 This much cheaper, shorter, less versatile version headset came phone
 Seek something better
 

The thing went wrong I broke it, got caught seat belt ripped wiring right soddering
 It goes Nokia phones I bought mine like 89 cents Amazon three dollars steep keep looking
 

The bud comfortable ear, actually stays place
 I like answer button headset
 Very easy use, comfortable
 I happy product would give full recommendation
 

This product cheap,yet good quality
The sound quality nice I love on/off button :)The cord looks durable whole thing super light
 

This headset trick
 For reason, Nokia cell requires special headset
 Other "standard" headsets work
 This one perfect
 

Sometimes works, sometimes says compatible phone
 When work; it's hard hear
 

This headset doesn't work Nokia 2320c
 The connector right size I plug in, error message "Enhancement supported", sound goes earbud
 I earlier purchased working headset Target, sound quality quite bad I bought one see would improvement
 

This item arrived
The adapter shown picture NOT fit Ikea phone described
I dissapointed
 









The cord could longer recharger
 Price right delivery timely
 

This thing nothing improve cellphone reception
 When I snapped on, I expected see increase signal strength
 Occassionally, I would get extra bar part, I can't figure possible benefit antenna brings
 







































































































This headset VERY Cheaply made stay ears
 If move AT ALL fall out
 I buy another set I chose Nokia headset
 They work well
 
















































I bought Nokia 2366i replace 3 year old Samsung sch a650
 I'm truck driver use cell phone lot
 And I ran old Samsung ground
 Never great phone, somewhat solid ol' workhorse nonetheless
 It finally broke two - literally
But big mistake recent Nokia 2366i replacement purchase was
 I cannot hear incoming call ringer
 On highest setting extremely difficult notice incoming call
 I've tried ringer settings highest possible level
 No satisfaction
 I guess best solution problem make habit picking phone every 10 minutes determine whether call come in
 Or simply get another phone - I plan do
What I percieve overall solid, functional phone ruined simple glitch
 What thinking released product beyond me
Hope review helps
Will 

This phone nice basic flip phone respects except one
 I cannot hear ringing unless hand already
 I usually carry purse end missing calls
 Yes, I tried different ring tones turned volume way, still quiet
 Unless live work bank vault, stay away phone
 

I like fact phone rings, don't jump skin, apologize rush put phone vibrate
 The clarity reception cannot beat, simplicity phone appeals age excess gadgetry phones
 I blame Verizon offering better Nokia selections
 If better T-Mobile coverage area, I would definitely switch Nokia phone selection
 But nice phone I vibrate well ring I catch car I listen tunes
 

I've phone year, LG phone 2 years
 I bought I work secure facilities allow cameras, phone Verizon camera
Pros:-call quality pretty decent-no complaint coverage-small package-decent constructionCons:-the menu structure horrible, simple features like SILENT mode require dig menus find - make phone useable, I create user menu put important features there-I miss quite calls I can't hear phone ring shirt pocket-when dialing number, I wait long 15 20 seconds I hear ring end-I routinely get voice messages, phone never rang first place, 'missed call' call record-there array funky little icons come go - I've phone year I still can't tell mean, spite referring manual times-simple features like calculator stink, almost unusable-the power connector proprietary
 I lost charger recent trip, I went Target get replacement - one 'Nokia - All Models'; Sorry, one
The bottom line need phone occasional call, phone probably OK
 If like make living phone, phone you
 I wish I 3 year old LG back
 

This Phone awful
 Short battery life, inaudible incoming call ring
 Don't purchase it, I would recommend anyone even worst enemy
 












































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Make sure check output requirements phone
 The N95 requires output DC 5
0V, 800mA
 This one output 7
6V, 700 mA, seen picture
 

Two Nokia phones I show error message "not compatible" plugged charger
Do buy
 

The first charger didn't last 24 hours, seller sent replacement questions asked
 Thanks
 

Not whole lot say


 It charger
 It works
 If need cheap replacement (or second third office / vacation home) go ahead get one
 

I bought keep suitcase travel
 I used vacation worked great
 
































Cable works fine official Nokia PC Suite software
This vendor shipped cable suspicious, unlabeled DVD-R software installers unknown provenance
 Turned disk coaster, used Nokia suite instead
 



































When I first got this, look like big enough phone, soon I opened package put phone I could tell perfect fit
 I really like clear window, I previous case, I see calling answer phone without take case every time
 































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The Nokia N93 coolest gadget I ever owned
 That may possesses something every gadget I ever owned
 You get online PC, take photos videos camera, play music MP3 player--well, get idea
Is phone multiple cameras collection cameras include phone feature? You decide
The 128 MB MiniSD memory card comes N93 won't do, plan getting, additionally, largest memory card (I got 2 gigabyte card)
My favorite software feature phone Lifeblog gathers messages, still shots video streams timeline life
 Cool stuff
 And shared PC
Finally, impressively, design device High Art
 Solid polished black metallic silver, compact, multifaceted device moving segments I ever seen
 As often happens, it's little things nuisance--count losing tiny lenscap, port covers within days purchase
 Otherwise plan enjoying Nokia N93 see it, feel it, live it
 

I love phone
 I cannot find using daily phone
 It big
 The lens cap rubbish though, hard plastic cracked putting lens time
 You can't take pictures videos jiffy see something interesting worth capturing
 The lens cap culprit
I also bought Nokia BT Keyboard (SU-8W) used phone works awesome
 You need download Nokia wireless keyboard software order pair two
 Now I type SMS real fast foldable keyboard
 I also CP-117 OEM leather case Nokia I couldn't stand beauty inside pouch came it
All all, you're recording videos making films jiffy
 This phone you
 If you're tech junkie like me, you're going like phone
 It's worth every penny
 

The Nokia N93 beyond reproach - little bulky - offer - bulk minor issue
 I highly suggest purchase 2 GB flash memory card (miniSD 2GB)With features available larger memory card almost must
 The company I ordered (DataVision Computer Video) fast efficient able answer questions without wait reply
 Thanks handled order way delivery
 Not glitch whole process
 I global traveler - phone/camera exactly I looking I started research
 

I using charger month it's working great
As bought one company $20 broke within month
 THe price right
 

I bought charger retractable cord I thought would less bulky car
 I used periodically, maybe twice week commute, 6 months, device stopped charging
 I thought port charger I bought second charger local electronic store worked I switched chargers one, phone would charge
 I iPhone product cannot recommended
 

The description said would fit Nokia N95, doesn't
 Not sure well works phones fit, I gave 2 stars least showing time
 

Looks like would work great
 It's small retractable cord plus, doesn't fit nokia n95, NAM edition anyway
 

Great space-saver
 And price less half Nokia brand, too
 Also, Nokia brand doesn't make retractable
 

The price good several months plugged car, still works
 I like fact cord retractable cause mess center console car
 
































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Has hung well working play
 Easy cleaning
 The clip "L" hook vice "J" hook, working well except thick belts
 I'd buy again
 





Yes, definitely worth extra bucks I recall cost compared others I looking at
 When I reviewing another product, reminder review popped up
 I've Krusell several years now, I hope I remember name I change phones
 This perfect fit phone, plastic see-thru cover incredibly durable much much use, really nice leather makes nice feel
 No snags clothing I put pockets belt clip
 I'm also amazed nice appearance still provides
 











This article works fab T coil equipted BTE hearing aids
After lot research I found good responce item cell phone use
It works primarily Nokia cell phones
 














One person's long winded opinion Amber 7370
About Phone Itself:I ordered phone another merchant last week
 When came I excited; everything I expected be
 It cute I received many compliments it
 There people actually asked was
 =)The phone sturdy I don't think falling average person's pocket hands onto ground would much damage
 The twist feature phone unique didn't take much time get used it
 The size screen great; I think it's much larger phones incredible considering size one
 The back phone Nokia describes faux-leather adds nice little contrast
The sound level phone average ringtone volume good different levels it
 It vibrate feature well
This phone bluetooth also fantastic downloading themes ringtones made downloaded others
The phone arrived text, multimedia internet settings T-Mobile easily fixed Nokia's website
 If search phone page section downloads send information service provider directly phone text message
 All open message settings put in, piece cake
There also 1
3 megapixel camera pretty cool
 If large fingers though plan rough time hitting button actually take pictures
 I don't abnormally large hands I struggling push button correctly
 That also goes power button side phone
 It small looks like something need search paper clip pen tip depress
 I able successfully accomplish two tasks I see may issue some
About Bands:I didn't know much "bands" difference "tri-band" "quad-band" (that means there's one more, right? *smiling blankly*) I received started using it
 This phone tri-band missing 850
 I would full signal one second, nothing next calls dropped every minutes
 After research I came realization phone missing 850 band Cingular uses (around area anyway &lt;Cape Cod>)
As I said before, phone came settings T-Mobile installed I'm pretty sure would work wonderfully service
 I can't say anything brands service it's definitly worth call company find out
The Good:~ Stylish~ Sturdy~ 1
3 Megapixel camera~ Bluetooth~ Large viewing screenThe Bad:~ No 850 band~ Very small buttons power cameraIf phone worked service I would happy probably wouldn't part it
 There definitly phones bells whistles chances good you're looking phone style
 






































































This excellent accessory listen mp3, radio phone
 The sound quality excellent
 I gadget office desk, I pick calls using speaker-phone
 The music stand allows charge phone's battery connected stand
The music stand also aux audio input also hear music devices it
Please buy accessory, check assure pop-port connector compatible Nokia Phone model own
 

nokia music stand great way supply back ground music wait adds
 Just hook mp3 unit listen tunes
 




I ordered product I Nokia 7370 fit port
 




Even thought product says supports kinds nokia phone, doesn't fit USB port Nokia 7260 all
 






































































































































































































































































































This charger worked great, never problem it
 It lasted longer daughters phone (it stolen)
 Well worth it, great buy
 















































The Headset works expected
 Connecting phone simple
 You Don't need techi
 Has less static even 30 foot walls too
 I able walk house (which great coz otherwise I don't signal inside house)
 And works Bluetooth enabled Inspiron Laptop
 I use calling Skype yahoo too
It light comfortable too
 

I bought headset August complement Nokia 6103
 In three months since, I've issues, aside relatively short battery life
 Talk time reasonable, you're phone constantly
 Calls come clearly, buttons well-placed, visual/audible low battery indicators make managing unit easier
 The silicone prongs uncomfortable first, meld user time
 The included charger recharges unit less 45 minutes, convenient
 The talk standby times par written specs
 It's great value price, basic functions; however, require talk time, advanced capabilities, look higher-end models
 

I found comfortable fitting unit I ever used
 The sound clear connects easily every time
 I tend try buy Nokia branded accessories simple reason stuff always somehow notch anything else find
 However, may I say, lose instructions probably won't remember pair new phone
 Now please excuse I go look instructions


 

I Nokia HS-26W Bluetooth Headset owning 3 Motorola Bluetooth headsets ie Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset
 The Motorolas poor quality every respect well costly
 Frustrated Motorola experience - I BestBuy Nokia available $50 (compared $120 I paid BestBuy Motorola HS850)
 My experience Nokia devices stellar since mid 90's I said not
 Plus price point half Motorola
 I purchased could believe quality, comfort, battery life - superior others price point hard believe
 At first I believed look Nokia slightly inferior Motorola using I found looks better Motorola ones sleek design versus bulbous design others
 

I've owned 2 days now, extremely pleased it
 After charging hours like instructions said, I paired without problems Motorola PEBL, Motorola RAZR, Mac PowerBook (built-in bluetooth) PC running Windows XP (bluetooth adapter)
 Instruction manuals say make 8 pairings
 Each pairing took seconds detect, paired successfully first try
 I've tested calls pairing, came excellent
 On computers, I used headset chat Skype
 Crystal clear even Skype, wireless broadband home
 On T3 network, connection even better
 Although pairings took time, PC connection took 3 tries next day
 Somehow, headset won't connect PC, 3rd try, succeeded
I problems echos
 I asked people end let know hear echos
 I don't like turning volume end way up, I can't tell loudest setting like
 But default volume, I able hear conversation without problem
It doesn't hurt ears
 It took tries figure place properly ear stable, doesn't hurt me
 (My first try awful, scrunched ear up
) I also wear 3 earrings, headset doesn't bother ear
Distance: At around 6-7 feet distance PEBL, headset starts getting staticky
 At around 5-6 feet distance PowerBook, headset starts getting staticky too
 However, pose problem me
 It might problematic people want leave phones one place, walk house without carry phone
Excellent product price I paid
 Strongly recommend now
 If headset breaks quality starts deteriorating unreasonable time, e
g
 within 1 year, I update
 Given price I paid, bad reviews headset almost put headset, I extremely pleased give 5 stars
 

4/7/07 Update: The headset died week
 I don't use much issues below
 But won't react charger
 I tried reseting like manual suggests
 And lights come - seems completely dead
 Nokia warranty replace another model, model doesn't look nice
 But working headset better headset
2/27/07 The reviews great persuaded buy headset
 At first I amazed - even helmet skiing one great hands free experience zipping slope
 But I'm finding I'm quieter situations callers tell echo
 I'm wondering microphone sensitive picks sound coming earbud (which also strong solid sound)?? Also, I've quite crackly sound 50% calls
 I LG phone (Verizon Chocolate Flip)
 I've actually thought I return this, haven't simply I'm lazy think late now
 I'm also imagining I'm something wrong, can't imagine what
 I need experiment turning volume see I eliminate echo
 

I really like headset, although it's compatible new phone (LGCU500)
 If Nokia, it's great
 The music plays ear like phone call comes in
 It great distance
 I could actually another room talking works fine
 I can't say Motorola
The battery life good, also
 It's great price great product, I wish worked new phone

[


]

 The ability easily add applications many available really nice
 The device syncs calendar contacts Mac Book Pro (after getting update Nokia) far better previous previous device I owned (Motorola Palm Treos)
The built browser quite good, couple oddities e-mail application perfect

 ph 

After owning number smartphones years, Blackberry's, T-Mobile Dash w/ Windows Mobile 6, etc
, Nokia blows away
 After 1 month using I happy purchase (got direct Mobilecity, cheaper)
 The S60 OS better Blackberry (way features 3rd party support) much stable fast Windows Mobile
Pros:- BIG beautiful 2
8" screen (the best feature, makes web surfing much better)- Light sensing screen looks great situation, even sunlight (it uses LCD-like mode)- Quality/durable construction- Excellent reception- Good battery life (2 full days w/ normal use)- Good camera video (performs good 3MP)- It talks (voice tells calling)- Nice keyboard (silent)- Stable S60 Symbian OS (never crashes)- 3rd party software support (excellent S60 phones), ie FREE utilities games- wifi works great- lots cool features


finding new stuff time, voice activation, gps, windows office support, voice recorder, themes, etc
- Excellent software Nokia PC Suite includes full configuration backups (not something MS never included), file manager, media players, etc
- Did I mention nice big 2
8" screen?Cons:- The basics easy, there's steep learning curve many menus configure power users want get phone (but rewarded efforts almost unlimited customizing features)
- handset volume could better (the speakerphone sounds great though)- The size phone may kinda big (I personally like it's size, it's probably everyone)- The call buttons top bit hard press due shape, kinda use fingernails
- Once annoyance lack button speakerphone (it's burried menu


time find OS hack this

)Nokia replaced phone 2009 E71, made screen much smaller, 2
3" now
" Big mistake Nokia
 I'll keep E61i never squint
Tips: The included web browser isn't bad, Opera Mini (free download) better
 As far Youtube, go mobile site integrate included Real Player watch videos
 Anytime can't figure something something isn't working way want, search google you'll find fix every time
 There almost nothing can't phone, like ultimate geek toy
 

I've used Nokia E61i 1/2 year Treo year that
 I use phone for- Exchange based Email Calendaring-- Good Email Messaging (3rd party sw)- Web browsing- Google maps: download application--it works great give directions show location based coordinates cell tower talking (or add true GPS)
- Voice callsWhat I like:- Overall quality: This phone one models survived Cisco's rigorous tesing replacement corporate smartphones (previously treos)
 They lot QA devices survived (blackjack, moto Q, Nokia e61i), phone best battery life
- Battery life: wow
 Only problem I tend loose charger now
- Moving treo phone took little adjustment (have quit trying tap screen)
 This phone much solid (treo would crash frequently), faster, battery lasts 3-4x long treo ever did
- Email w/ Good Mobile Messaging software slick
 This company uses
- Dimensions: phone thin light wide is, much comfortable pocket treo
- Stability
 I run email calendaring client (Good), web browser (excellent way), google maps time without crashes
 More programs probably close something get enough memory
 Switching applications easy, hold app key select app want switch to
- WiFi roaming: I like wifi available I weak signal
 Web browsing quick wifi
What I don't like:- You can't always copy paste text easily could Treo
 Mostly, web browser doesn't allow copy text web page use another app
 This isn't huge deal me, since click-to-call still works I'm looking phone numbers Google Maps
 

I Nokia E61i really frustrating experience
 It good phone bad PDA
Networking nightmare phone keeps going different networks random
 Seems stores access point bookmark, that
 Constantly get memory cards plenty mem left I also added @ GB card
Would want anyone else go I gone spending good money this
 Not recommended please buy
Also reason Nokia moving away s/w start using MS s/w phones time future
Really bad way Nokia able pass consumers deceptive marketing
 























































































product good shape, decent quality
 It works great Nokia E61
 price unbeatable
 satisfied
 

Great product, Nokia E61i fitted perfectly it
 The finish sharp elegant
 

The openings case wrong place
 I Nokia E61 cannot charge phone case use wired headset
 That makes inconvient
 Other great
 










































































































































































































































































































































The first thing get phone change packet data "when available" "when needed"
This done going settings-->config-->connection-->packet dataThis solve battery complaints posted others
 I get ~2
5 days single charge
I 3 long weeks use abuse features phone
Size wise: If problem putting phone pocket, get looser fitting pants
 People probably seeing phone bulging case
Buttons: The whole keypad spacious including D-pad
 I large hands find tactility buttons high easy texting
 The keypad buttons even tilt little make easy slide hand around fast texting/e-mailing
Camera: Not strong point
 In situations green tint photos
 The camera works best outside sunlight produce pictures acceptable 5x7 green tint
Operating system: Strong point phone big time
 The Symbian S60 OS customizable OS I ever seen
 Honestly, something want customize probably it
 It may take days get used Symbian S60 won't look back
 The availability 3rd party programs endless
 I recommend Smart2go & Handy Alarm
 Don't tell AT&T; actually smartphone PIM features need
 Syncs Outlook much easier/faster Activesync Windows mobile
 It also easy setup e-mail accounts phone
Media features: A pop-port 3
5 2
5mm headphone jack available online $5-8, Nokia's version bit more
 It worth investment media player + 2gb MicroSD replaced iPod nano
 AT&T; left Nokia's Music player phone best phone media player I ever used
 The built speakers loud, I mean insanely loud
 I turn 11 drown TV hurt ears 5 feet away
 Once adjusting EQ sound quality improves
 They slighty tinny bad expect
Screens: Both screens amazing
 The inside screen crisp wash direct sunlight
 The outside functional often times allows flip open phone lot features
Web: Use Nokia's web browser Media Net one
 It full feature browser displays webpages like computer
 It go mobile phone web actual web
 Very amazing far superior Mobile IE
Call Quality: Very clear yet drop call
 I found calling people hear call quality first days
 I couldn't believe clarity
 Speakerphone loud via little speakers back
I would recommend phone anyone looking phone PDA functionality
 The multimedia features add functionality Symbian OS
Every phone flaws I find phone possess fixing battery issue customizing bit
 

I'll start saying I NOT phone junkie
 I normally pick whatever phone free I renew service contract
 There fantastic deal phone offered much I decided put couple bucks pick up
I use phone phone - rarely use internet interest using MP3 player
 That said, I uploaded number MP3s phone use ring tones surprised great sounded
 The speakers loud songs sound great
The call quality amazing - best mobile phone I've ever used owned
 When calls come in, great job minimizing background noise (I loud environment husband called - commented clear call couldn't even hear background noise
)I love easy manage minor tasks without flipping phone open
 The screen stunning, menus quick responsive
 I charge phone every 2 3 days (again, I'm using internet, camera, mp3 player games frequently, I use occasion
) I lock keypad issues anything starting running yet
 While I appreciate blue tooth technology, I'm happy phone also option port Nokia wire headset even fewer worries draining batteries
 I sync phone Outlook - phone seems sync much better phone I previously owned
Overall, I'm satisfied phone I would recommend others looking phone happens cool features
 

I really high hopes phone, ultimately disappointed
 I loyal Nokia guy years looked forward first smartphone
 More I wanted combo phone/music player N75 seemed fit bill
 I skeptical going candy bar flip phone, I figured long I could voice dial (you can) answer (you can't) without opening phone, would fine
But, end, phone failed shortcomings music player implementation poor battery life
 Sadly, I looking another phone
DESIGN:Pros:+ Gorgeous displays out
+ Outside display seems right info (especially using music player)
+ Great number keypad large keys excellent tactile feel
Cons:+ Navigation keys flat
 I often hit wrong key sending distant parts OS canceling middle task
 After I got complaint faded
+ Battery cover held place hair trigger release
 Cover often came I pulled phone pocketMENUS O/S:Pros:+ Symbian 60 OS opens world possibilities - I chance really sample
+ Highly customizable menus enabled obtuse menu trees
Cons:+ Power hungry OS
PHONE:Pro's:+ Great call quality, great speaker phone, plenty volume
+ Can make calls cover closed using voice dialing
Cons:+ Can't answer phone cover closed - soft keys available silence decline call, answer speakerphone
 What shame I wife's Nokia 6126 makes flip phone much convenient
+ Easily paired bluetooth headset (but NOT stereo bluetooth)CAMERA:Pros:+ Take pictures phone open closed, includes flash
 Serviceable image management phone (delete, view, etc)Cons:+ Shutteer laaaag, mediocre image quality 2 mp camera
MUSIC PLAYER:Pros:+ Really nice music player app great controls
+ Sounds pretty good phone's little speakers
+ Controls outside cover great
+ Includes equalizer
Cons (the dealbreakers me):+ NO STEREO BLUETOOTH - I know advertised web site, misprint confirmed calls Cingular Nokia
 Nokia says required A2DP profile available firmware update, won't tell when
+ No 3
5 mm headset jack
 You deal Nokia's proprietary POP port, takes 1/3 left side phone requires adapter work 3
5mm headset
 The POP cord/adapter difficult insert correctly aptly named POP port easily pops -- I lots Nokia experience here
+ Nokia Music Manager 2
0 PC software transferring music crashed often XP recognize memory phone (tried two different brands sd cards) Thankfully included Windows Media Player driver worked well transfers went smoothly cards
BATTERY LIFE: (more dealbreakers)Very poor; phone gobbles power like Hummer towing tank
 Combo small battery hungry O/S displays kills batteries fast
 I really couldn't get 1 hrs talk time day this, that's without bluetooth headset
 Yes, I followed web advice setting data "as needed" setting
 If really want use smart phone: email, web, PIM phone, better carry spare batteries
 

I N75 two weeks report:o I find loose-fitting lid irritant
 Maybe other(')s don't
o Mine doesn't make funny internal sounds
o Mine doesn't get hot
o Mine doesn't drop calls
o No stero bluetooth
o Mine seems good job voice recognition
o It bluetooths Moto H500 quickly, voice recognition worksfine also
o The surface soak finger prints
o The display screens spectacular
o I like large buttons key pad
o Large screen, large buttons = large phone, I guess
o The battery goes flat pretty fast (one day), I'm constantlyplaying phone
 Maybe newness wears off, It'lldo better
o The pop-port pain; also, put topor bottom
o Transferring pictures, music application using pop-portis breeze
 It's quicker screwing microSD
o Speaker loud enough
o Being able load different application neat
o The pictures seem plenty sharp 2 Mega-pixel
 If blow themup, become pixelated (see submitted pictures)
o I'm going keep hope battery solution, learn tolive it
 

I ordered phone month back received days ago
I bought mainly 3G connection fact it's Nseries phone
I came Nokia 6230 fairly small candy bar style phone going bigger flip phone like N75 big step
I use 6102i whichever free phone cingy time gripes basically compared two phones
HATE:- Sim card access
 I don't know there's another way insert SIM card, child take out
 Almost impossible grab pull out
- Speakerphone really low almost inaudible even volume cranked up- Vibrate phone really


 mild
 If it's pocket, probably won't feel it
 Especially you're train, example
- Long boot compared two non Symbian phones I had
- annoying pop port 

 didn't think would issue hold phone two hands insert headset


 annoying
- emoticons txt messages??

- reply txt hit options->reply->via txt msg
 Why can't hit reply go straight txt box?- zoom phone takes f o r e v e r
- STOPWATCH COUNTDOWN TIMER?
- fingerprints/face prints get xfrd phone easily- battery life : internet use on/off = 4-6 hours 2 10min calls 6hours standby; MobiRadio speaker, continuous = 1
5hours; mixed internet, mobiradio, regular radio, phone calls, text messaging, tinkering phone= 6 hours so
 All hours est full charge batt dies
 Includes intermittent standbys I look phone
The charger tethered hip
Like:- really soft big keys- ability move around files/ folders- Nice big screen- Video (choppy pixelated do)will con't months pass




**UPDATE:-battery life improved significantly
 I still use 13hrs day I charge day
 And use more
-I also bought primarily MP3 player I'm problem I 6230
 The shuffle really shuffle
 I 200 songs insists playing songs every 10th-15th song


 seems loop songs I've heard already every single time
-I use HS-31 headset I volume really low
 I roll windows car order carry conversation
 I thought speakerphone low volume
 The bluetooth earpiece loud, though
-And finally, 3G
 I found discernable difference EDGE 3G networks downloading video viewing webpages
 Maybe loaded page seconds faster it
 Mobiradio still buffered every 3G networks surprising well
I'm still going keep phone, though
 

Once again, reason, Cingular got wrong
They called phone 'Music Phone' doomed limited release
Lucky us, means get profit it
 I got phone $9
98 Amazon (they even threw free standard shipping) get unlimited internet SMARTPHONE $19
99/mo (MediaMax200 plan, also includes 200 txt 200 multimedia unlimited Cingular Video); SMARTPHONEs Cingular's lineup require much higher cost PDA package, since think 'Music Phone' use standard package



Also, 'Music Phone', fully covered insurance package, phones equivalent one completely non-covered
Now, phone itself:PROS:~ Looks ~ I get LOT comments it, conservative, made playful easily
Nokia N75 colorful abstract Gel skin n75-g5~ Main Screen ~ Absolutely beautiful, huge screen, seen even direct sunlight well enough read
 Even works landscape mode
~ Flip Screen ~ As good screen INSIDE cell phones, actually used read txt messages, camera viewfinder, calender, music player


 cool
~ External Buttons ~ All functional, cover wide spectrum use without bothering open cover


 I can, example, completely reset camera settings here
~ Internet ~ Surf full internet (not Wap Version) flip phone, without paying iPhone prices? Incredible
~ Symbian ~ The operating system smooth, fast, secure


 importantly, I found useful applications place free
~ Everything Else ~ Simply put, I could go forever, text messaging fast, camera excellent, BOTH bluetooth infrared, package slightly thicker RAZR
 Most importantly, phone completely customizable (even fonts) features simple use
 On RAZR V3xx, example, try using Voice Dialing


 hit button, say 'voice dial', say name, 'yes'



 here, I hit button, bark name, dials


 like meant to
CONS:Nothing perfect, close


~ Battery Life ~ If play game hour so, text message friends, spend time phone, play around internet (be average power user), need charge phone EVERY NIGHT


 might even spend time dead pocket
 This ONLY happens power users, buying phone, problems
~ Stereo Bluetooth ~ Phone come Stereo Bluetooth support, stated company due release time constraints, supposed come firmware update


 idea when
All all? This phone must


 I can't wait announce firmware update, and, even though I like thin phone, I would much preferred larger battery this
 Even issues, phone market I would rather money, even beats many much expensive phones well
 

hinge phone faulty
 type normal use easily crack hinge course manufacturer blames usage
 wireless phones 10 years never damaged one, two hinges 3 months gave horrible hinge design
 

The Nokia N75: 12
01
2007After lot research phone get, signing new 2 year contract AT&T;, I chose Nokia N75 cellular companion next 2 years
 This obviously big decision, I much willing research wait right purchase price
Here I came decision:My primary requirement cell phone purchase foremost functions well reliably PHONE, additional features merely supplementary
 The Nokia N75 functions well phone, good reception, large comfortable buttons, easy contact management, intuitive text capabilities
 I interested using miniature QWERTY Keyboard small device like lot modern phones, N75, despite advanced, still standard keypad
I somewhat interested phone decent camera take quick snapshot I'm friends, I don't nice Digital camera me
 The N75 2 mega pixel camera takes acceptable photos
 It also shoots pretty high quality video w/ sound
The MP3 Music features nice, speakers output decent sound, feels like novelty show friends
 I used times quiet room, sounds good small laptop
 The Phone functions well MP3 Player
The user interface intuitive, main screen crisp useful
 The design phone feels clean geometric, obvious attention detail Nokia
The main reason phone great deal, fact get free Amazon, makes aforementioned features incredible deal
The Battery life, others stated, seems last couple days, I live house, I don't mind taking 5 seconds plug phone wall I sleep
 Duh
It's also manufactured Finland, I find pretty neat, since majority phones manufactured Asia, rest technology comes anyways
 I product Finland, cool
This great phone ton features, great design, great price
 

I pay $[


] mail rebates phone phone features I want
 It syncs outlook, nice internet browser interface many nifty features
 It also calls name entered address book receive call
 I happy phone
Only caution use is, buying phone Amazon, please prepared wait nearly 2 weeks till get phone
 I think takes time Amazon pass info cellular company mail device getting approval
 

I've loyal palm user 6 years I've Tungsten 3 since came out
 That means I've pretty powerful handheld, camera video Internet
 I've used V600 T-mobile along palm allowed browse Internet GPRS (or CSD I want save $) take pictures
 That said, I 95% I could N75
First experiences prevent giving 5 stars:1) can't connect CSD data connection
 This would great could use phone minutes data
 free minutes data2) The pop port bit annoying I think door eventually fall off
 standard headset port earphone port USB would great (see N76)3) phone software issues
 Apparently better far experiences people I know smartphone WM5 treos
 But I moments person end cant hear I need restart phone
 Granted I 5 apps running time
Now pluses:1) see number 3
 This thing multitasks well
 Much better Palm ever did
2) SIND - speaker independent name dialing, means don't train phone voice dialing
3) SYNCML - get scheduleworld account 

I using phone year now
 Here's list things like/unlikePros -Nice battery life(after chage setting improve it)
Battery gets fuly charged time
 around 40-45 min
Camera quality good
Call quality good, easy sync bluetooth headsets
Cons -Phone heats little bit gets warm talk long time
Just 9-10 months usage, hangs sometimes (not much though, every couple weeks)
 

I bought Nokia cell phone weeks ago nightmare
 A week later I activated it, suddenly died
 The screen became while-blank without functions normal cell phone display battery charging
 No matter long charged battery, screen became black seconds
 I called Nokia repair sent new battery
 However, nothing changed - phone work
 I sent phone them
 They checked phone returned back without anything except upgrade software phone
 They said nothing wrong phone
 Again nothing changed - work
 I called solution
 And required send phone again
 Since every time I send phone I need pay shipping
 It ridiculous I pay shipping send phone return nothing say nothing wrong phone
 I bought numerical phones Nokia worst product service
 I won't purchase Nokia more
 

I upgraded N75 Nokia 6230; I'm big fanof AT&T; service Nokia phones
 In general, I'm happywith N75
 It certainly cram-packed features;bluetooth, phone, mp3, fm radio, organizer features,a scaled-down version adobe real player, externalmemory card hot-swappable easy access
Many phones require open device removethe battery access memory card resets theinternal clock date
 I haven't experienced poorbattery life way reviewers have, maybeI'm lucky
 This phone every featureyou think without go blackberry-typeform factor, I really wanted flip phone rather thana bar phone
 My main complaint processor speedand performance; whenever want phone something,there noticeable delay, couple seconds, andthere slow reaction keypad buttons astransitioning phone mode camera mode, etc
 Ifthere faster processor phone itresponded quickly I would complaints
 

Horrible battery life

Pls dont buy phone
 
Battery life sucks big time

I asked amazon replacement another phone within warranty period
 But that
 There many phone better this
 Sincere advice 

dont go this
 

I say, seeing features come phone, I pretty excited receive it
 However, I 2 months, I disappointed, wish I would bought something else
PROS-Clear screen inside out-Non-scratch surface outside phone keeps phone looking good-Speakers sound good, played pretty loud-Ability add memory card SD slot-Large buttons inside easy use-Ability see text messages without even opening phoneCONS-Small amount memory begin with-When selecting option (menu, profiles, messaging, etc
) pause going option
 gets annoying really fast
-I found way lock outside phone, phone randomly play songs (if phone)-Phone rather large opened, even though doesn't seem big closed
-Front screen easily scratched-TERRIBLE battery
 I battery go dead one day
 Small amount juice battery
-Camera takes ok pictures
 Not good would think camera like this
Overall, I disappointed phone
 There many options, especially slider phones, much better deals this
 Be sure research get phone
 

Nokia N75 Phone (AT&T;)As phone, sole reason purchase N75, call quality good picks signal well (much better wife's Samsung, also AT&T;)
 However, I problem--there three times three weeks I answered made call person end couldn't hear me
 The problem persisted several trial calls I made immediately afterward
 I turn phone get microphone work again
I exchanged phone new one thing--once week I used it
 Nokia aware microphone problem, I read another Amazon review person problem, even replacement
 It may design flaw exposed way I use phone, 90% loudspeaker use calls (I shouldn't speculate cause, thing I differently people)
Other one problem, I like phone much going keep it
 However, frustrating I important call person end says "hello


hello


anyone there?", hangs up, even though I'm yelling "hello, hello, hear me?"
 Obviously can't, I'll turn phone call again
 

Pros-3G (UMTS) supportCingular's music video servicesexcellent call qualityintegrated Bluetoothexternal music controlsgorgeous internal displayspacious keypad
Cons-very short talk time battery life2-megapixel camera took below-average picturesproprietary port headsets headphones
no HSDPA support, Wi-Fi, GPS
 

Nokia N75 member Nokia N-series
 It smart phone based "Symbian S60" operating system, supporting various application programs, like Microsoft Office document viewer, PDF viewer, web browser, enamel client, photograph editor video many others
The operating system fast secure, many useful applications internet free
The external Buttons cover wide range functions without need open cover
The Nokia N-75 digital music player play list capability equalizer, play music audio formats
 The Nokia N-75 2 megapixel camera 16x digital zoom LED flash, MPEG-4 video recording capabilities 15fps
 The still pictures video recordings satisfactory
The Nokia N-75 full useful efficient features, two main cons:- It come Bluetooth support, and- The Battery Life really short times frustrating
 

At first I believed Nokia abality make one greatest pnones there, product proved wrong
 Sure, first looks great, interface that, time goes by, defects start show up
 The biggest problem phone sim card luck can't securely keep sim card place everytime I try start phone kept giving error message" start failure, please contact retailer", drove nuts

Imaging everytime turn phone it's like gambling, might get might not
 Secondly, phone shortest battery life I ever seem life
 The battery brand new I charge every single day
 The web indicates battery suppose stand time 8 hours, believe me, like 4 hours, start talk, dies hour
 This terrible phone
 

I phone eight months now
 I used first four months AT&T; branded, I got unlock it, flashed generic firmware
With AT&T; branded firmware, music bluetooth work(A2DP)
I also installed several games (centipede,chess,pacman,etc


) it, play regularly

 Large buttons, great texting T9, faster qwerty keyboard me
3
 Great camera bright environments(sunny, outside)
4
 Nice video camera environments, mpeg4 compression
5

Cons:1
 No WiFi2
 Flash LED, Xenon3
 No cover lens4
 Proprietary nokia headphone jack, must buy adapter
 I got mine e-bay
5
 2MP longer impressive camera6
 Due two backlit screens, bluetooth, 3g, etc



 battery life short
7
 Software slow multi-tasking, boot time bit slow
 

Likes:-WMA Player, files WMA format, truly music player-FM Radio, times dont want listen music-Camera provides best picture phone-Big phone, dont like small ones small buttons-No need carry mp3/ipodDislikes:-Voice activated dialing HORRIBLE
 old motoKRZR worked perfect-Extremely low battery time, someone please figure out, charge phone night 4pm everyday-Slow startup timeOVERALL: Buy phone you're like like bigger phones great music/media access

--this could issue phone rather N75 model (check Cingular/AT&T;);2
 I keep getting "Smartchip Registration Failed" message
 While may issue Cingular/AT&T;, new customer would frustrated number times I received message (4 times 3 days)
 The solution I found remove battery, restart phone, hope doesn't fail register


(failure means phone service);3
 No really effective PIM
 While phone great "as phone," PDA fails book central PIM
 An address book calendar (as separate apps) work well, useful PIM included
 Furthermore, I yet find "functional-for-my-purposes" PIM available S60 symbian even meets standard PIM provided Palm, MS mobile, Blackberry devices


If looking great phone many features (music, great camera/video, etc


), phone perfect
 If need PDA good PIM, perhaps look elsewhere


 Nokia Symbian would well create PIM service deivces "out box
" 

looks great

 screen really good
the camera poor quality shutter laag

 true
 

I waited phone long time finaly came out
 Just everthing greath phone apps features great
 The olny real downside battery life nokia fixes problem phone easly 5
 Oh one thing, sideburns WATCH OUT
 Your hair get caught internal display frame around it
 I order screen protectors hopefully close gap
 

Pro:- 3G- podcast download directly phone- great screenCon:- Turning phone takes forever
- Random problem plague phone
I expected better quality Nokia
 I rather less feature solid performance
 

Pro: many functions
con: I inserted Sd card slot direction (I well first time)
 It stuck aperture spent lot time take out
 Bad battery, I need charge cell every two less days
 Easily press connection bottom accidently (Which charges money); Cannot see rm form videos(can hear it)
 

This great product
 All features like Sound/Music/Camera/call recption cool
 It works amazing
Battery Sucks

 Very Bad
 Being music phone, listen battery dies
 Battery bad
 (5 short calls, battery Zero
_ 

Yeah lot features, like others said battery crappy, also construction cheap camera doesn't take good pictures
 I bought mainly I expecting fairly decent camera I'm disappointed
Don't drop either, I dropped mine huge crack hinge, something repaired
Oh second one, first one I return malfunctioning
 I wish given something different return
 

I considered many different cell phones deciding Nokia N75, I disappointed far
 I using phone month now, I've time evaluate features
 The interface quite easy get used to, even switching completely different phone
 The sound quality great, I've never turn volume half way hear perfectly
 It works well bluetooth headset equally good sound quality
 You easily create ringtones mp3s add phone, sound great - transfer via bluetooth
 The feature lacking quality camera - pictures takes quite bad, I buy phone camera
 If want good quality camera cell phone (if thing exists), probably phone you
 Many reviewers complain poor battery life, I problem
 In fact, battery usually lasts 2-3 days without charging, I spend day surfing internet playing games it
 

I purchased cell phone recommendation friend
 My old super simple phone dying, I needed minutes, figured good time upgrade
Overall, I'm fairly disappointed phone
 Why?(1) It's bulky
 Imagine size razr, double width(2) Battery life poor noted
 The 2 hours talk time probably pretty accurate
 I'm told debranding dropping GSM (instead 3g) helps, I'll try soon(3) Build quality - phone feels cheaply built
 The hinge weird feel, battery cover always feels loose
 The phone doesn't 'solid' feel all
(4) It's slooooooooow
 Menus take forever open
 If hit one soft keys open text message - takes 6-7 seconds load
 Did get that? Do idea annoying waiting long send text message?(5) No direct option view incoming text messages
 You go messages > inbox, adding extra keystroke(6) The navigation (left/right) buttons cramped next others
 I don't fat fingers means, quickly hitting left right without accidentally hitting hte menu keys damn near impossible
Overall, S60 platform feels really slow phone
 I tried running Smart2Go (Nokia Maps), found almost unusable long takes map redraw
I'm really sure people want smart phones much
 You'll hardly end using features end bulky phone
 Either go something QWERTY big screen huge processor, stick simple phone lightweight, quick responsive
 

This best phone get AT&t money
 But make sure order memory card extra charger
 The batter drains fast connected net
 My previous cell nokia 6682 I'm used much better battery life
 It's also annoying can't listen FM radio via bluetooth
 But I love phone 

Have using phone almost 1 year, can't bear anymore deserves first product review
Do NOT buy it
I use everyday PHONE review based basic feature
1) Phone speaker worst part
 There large echo every time speak
 When happened, repeat said cuz side can't hear you
 It annoying drives crazy
2) Time time, I picked phone, ppl side can't hear (I hear them)
 I power phone
3) NOKIA used good signal reception
 But phone not
4) Heavy
5) Bad battery, I removed almost unnecessary programs, still need recharge everyday
 Battery life far product description claimed
 

I don't know people hate phone talking about


This phone awesome
 I think write reviews really learn use it



the use it, like it
 The battery NOT bad everyone says


the small complaint camera doesn't take good pictures dark
 

After using phone 2 months, I've come realization unit seriously flawed:- screen blanks out- phone shuts unexpectedly- battery gets hot minimal use
In addition, I would caution new purchasers return phone 30-day period
 Otherwise, you're stuck piece junk
 

This worst phone I've ever used
1
 It loses calls
 A lot important calls came ring show missed calls
2
 The flip portion telephone cracked 1 month
 Amazon won't replace right 30 days
 Nokia fix hardware problem
 Now, 3 months normal use, display coming well
3
 The phone turns randomly
 I become paranoid check status phone frequently
4
 If still decide buy one, prepare 3 chargers
 One office, one home car charger
 The battery last even one day
 

The big problem phone, I ultimately returned it, external buttons cannot disabled
 As result, phone mild pressure (e
g
 pocket), display lights battery wears down
 I think phone manufacturers want outsides phones bristle buttons, needs combination pushed takes phone standby
 Personally I would prefer open phone, activate mp3 player, shut work inactivty timeout
 There's need thing running around active time I'm using it
Before I purchased phone, I downloaded manual found feature standby mode could disabled, whatever means
 I hoping I looking for
 However I got phone home I found software different version many ways manual wrong one
 The settings completely reorganized
I also trouble flat buttons - hard work
The pop port pain headset
The system boots incredible slowness
These I could lived however
General rant cellphone manufacturers: The thing I want phone (and I bought Nokia) I hoping good receiver technology
 When phone companies going remember phone first foremost phone, start publishing specs receiver competing them? And competing phone? Frills nice, phone part? Duh
 

This first "smart phone", I lot research got really excited getting it
 I read good bad, opinion, phone fantastic
 I love design, clean touch panel inside clamshell, texture exterior
 It very, customizable ring tones, photos screensavers, many 2G microSD cards want, loaded music pics, create usable personal device
 I sync Outlook everyday reminders appointments important plans I might run late forget within busy schedule
 I LOVE THIS PHONE
 I know N95 lot billboard advertising season, I hope people discover Nokia's efforts create great line products
 

The phone good
 But battery life pretty less
 Need recharge every 2 days even without use
 Also response times slow
The vibrations effective
, sometimes able feel even phone trouser pocket
 

switched at&t; iphone purchased phone instead
 I wanted like phone hoped reviews wrong
 They weren't
First, ATT's "3G" network VERY SLOW compared Verizon's (my previous carrier)
Second, phone packed bugs quirks
 Programs (especially music player) turn phone use pocket
 This eats battery time
 Often, take phone find battery dead this
The camera ok plan use photoshop fix pix like 80's horror movie color
 

As someone who'd die-hard Nokia user years, I really looking forward (finally
) getting 3G phone Nokia
 However, upon trying using it, I quickly sent back
 Here's why:- It's big
 Also come 6230 (which amazing phone right), thing mammoth
 Even folded, barely get pocket, unfolded, it's enormous
 Even unfolding chore
- It feels cheap
 The rubberized plastic coating destined rub off, battery cover back barely held small plastic tab
 While main numeric keys large, don't distinctive feel, makes touch-typing kinda hard
 In addition, D-pad keys small close menu music keys
 I repeatedly went music menu I meant hit "right
"- The camera, well, sucks
 I took pictures lighted dim conditions grainy poorly white balanced
 You wait long flash kick it's pretty much useless anyway
 Add fact lens rather stupidly placed bottom phone, it's rather disappointing overall
- It complicated
 As others mentioned here, basic navigation involved many steps simple items like replying whatnot
As battery life, I never even really got far issues turned much
 Considering spend two years one things, better really like send back get something love
 For get phone, try turning 3G access "when available" "when needed
" I've heard really helps
I returned phone (thanks Amazon fairly easy return process) got Blackberry Curve instead
 Love it
 I don't even miss 3G
 

Two things cell phone made decide go back old phone: (1) It gets hot short phone conversation; (2) The battery lasts two days even I don't make phone calls
 It even worse old cell phone I used two years
I disappointed phone trying return it
 

I bought 2 PCs I'm happy them
 I use Nokia phones last 10 years
 worst handset I ever had
 battery goes quickly, many times becomes hot talking
 speaker quality bad
 sound clarity worst
 lock, unlock feature useful
 lock phone give kid, kid opens flip unlocks automatically
 availability batteries phone retail store difficult
 order online
 click back button flip starts searching music even though music loaded
 This phone annoying features useful features
 

I've 3 phones (all new) problem 3 - turn warning
 None phones dropped, nothing downloaded 3rd party applications installed them, yet three done thing
 I've phones desk, untouched, power down
 I've missed emergency calls becuase phone I didn't realize it, I've missed calls (for reason) caused kinds problems


 What good fancy features phone unreliable?Nokia says it's probably issue AT&T;'s software/firmware
 AT&T; wants keep replacing (new) phones rebuilt ones




 many supposed go through? I'm spending hours phone AT&T; trying get replace phones different model
 I'm going bite bullet cough cash new phones retail, wait AT&T; contract expire I move another service provider
By way - I've Cingular/AT&T; 10+ years never problem I got N75
 But several major go-rounds AT&T; theses phones, I'm disgusted, frustrated, fed I N75s - good either one can't rely them?Stay away model, especially AT&T; service - save hassle
 

I using phone since one year now
 This first Nokia phone
 And I great expectations Nokia I got positive reviews friends relatives though Nokia brand phone
But phone disappointing
 Battery life phone bad I need recharge phone everyday even usage low
 And camera though 2 MP, quality pictures bad
 And lot software problems too
 Phone front navigation buttons music player consistent sometimes even pressing keys many times respond
I still high regard Nokia phone
 It may one bad model Nokia having
 I probably give try another Nokia phone future
 

using phone occassionally okay
 But i'm phone family members hour long conversation, thing feels like it's going explode get's hot
 It doesn't get warm, get's burning hot
The design nice, options nice
 The user interface lags bit due options allows for
Huge fan nokia, huge fan phone
 Nice free though
 

purchased Nokia N75 phone looks good buti big problems battery cover batter power


both cheap quality
i need recharge twise day though talk almost 1 hour 2 hour, battery removing cover delicate coming knoweledge
 would suggest better buy another phone
 

This phone leaves much desired
 However, Amazon
com initiated replacement carrier refused becase I didn't buy them
 The replacemtent better much
 Nokia work model
 

The reviews positive, let temper mood bit
 I like Nokia phones, frustrating issues phone:-mediocre image quality (odd lens issues)-- stress camera features description-mediocre battery life-NO headphone jack, Yes, read correctlyTheir many good web reviews magazines easily found online phone: give 6-7 10 stars/points etc
 

amazing deal youi like phone much also price one beat 

If owned older nokia's, pre N-series, love phone
 Its everything old phones were, durable, easy use, basic premium functionality low cost
This phone always compared N-95 ridiculous
 want meant super phone, designed average consumer wants nokia style phone premium fucntionality
Pro's> The camera great, camera-phone, 2MP ain't bad spur moment pics
> The screens amazing vibrant colors smooth transitions
 whole OS software beautiful
> Great Music - The music played phone closed, easy use, equalizer, playlists, etc
 Easy use too
> Memory card - You insert microSD card giving phone 2GB memory music, pics, backup, video, etc
> Under $200 smart phone
 iPhone $500 nokia know gonna last
> Solid Casing, feels strong durable, like last
 Similar size Razor class, strength functionality
> So far 3rd party apps work well - gmail, google maps, opera


not many pop-ups asking permission



lots memory apps wish
Cons> The biggest complaint use standard headphones phone
 But $30 buy adapter lets use standard headphones, standard headphone port
> bluetooth headeset(jabra 250) hasn't worked well thus far
 doesn't react phone old nokia (6102i)
 But seems working better lately, sure incompatibility issue what
> Voice-recognition - far worthless - read contacts names nevers gets said right
 liked voice tags old nokia 6102i
 issue could associated bluetoth headset thats use speed voice dialing
 

I've using N75 little works great
 The screen amazing
 It makes browsing internet true pleasure, says lot flip phone
 Also, since N-Series phone it's jam packed multimedia features
 The 2Mp camera looks better ones currently market MP3 player cool "stero widening" feature
Top reasons I love phone:1
 2Mp camera featues makes uploading pictures, showing cool slide show music, transfering friends, whatever else I want easy
2
 Great internet browser
 It's 3G(super fast) neat browsing tools like going back several past pages, mini map scan quickly large web pages, ability view every website I've to
3
 The call quality outstanding
 It's Nokia nobody makes phone quite well do
Things I don't like:1
 I wish came memory card
 I've got lot music videos need space
2
 I wish 3
5mm jack headphones, adapter works okay loudspeaker's pretty loud
3
 I paid $250 mine
 I'm kicking seeing deal
 

I live Tempe, near phoenix area, I bought N75
 There issues phone seems specific phoenix area, follows:1
 Upon restarting phone shows "startup failed, contact retailer"I contacted customer support today regarding failed startup, gave workaround:-You start phone tapping End key Cingular fireball logo startup, (or interrupt startup cingular logo), boots around scripting
2
 Upon starting like this, able access certain menu items like Clock Settings -> config
The customer support said known issue working provide firmware update would sent phones
 They said know release date available, could know coming weeks
 It might go one month, still developmental stage
Now, way get around menu access problems without reset phone
 Go offline mode, try accessing menus

 It works

 Now come back normal(online) mode, still available


 long dont restart phone
 Also, menus work actually access menus offline mode, later come back online
Basically, DONT need reset/remove battery phone, leads data loss


So, I guess live workarounds/issues AT&T; provides us update
 People outside phoenix area shouldnt probs
Apart fromt his, everything nice phone

 The display screens, music video mode spectacular, Camera images doesnt come W810i
 One slight issue need tweezers take sim card
 

Here's gets five stars based, again, SPECS FEATURES, compared hands experience Sony Ericsson's latest w810i, LG CU500, Samsung SYNC Mot's KRAZR:It's made trusted cell phone manufacturer - NokiaIt doesn's cost $500 bucks, like ipod/cingular entry next month
 It's $50 bucks Amazon/Cingular
It stereo bluetooth transmissions (A2DP)
 w810 not-most cell phone music players not, though bluettooth, stereo bluetooth enabledN75 latest version bluetooth, 2
0, allowing multiple items paired simultaneously, hopefully creating better connections bluetooth 1
2, music phones have
It exterior music controls bigger easier operate LG CU500, Samsung SYNC especially MOT Krazr verizon version (which buttons slide fingers across
 They look cool, repeatedly many users, hard operate)It's exterior controls allow start MP3 player without opening clamshell
It's exterior display shows playlist lateral fashion, like streaming stock market ticker, making intuitive use exterior playlist scroll button (positioned laterally directing backward/forward button doubles within play mode song)
 CU500 scroll function, sync perhaps others, small exterior display setup vertical scroll harder use, horizontally oriented button
There eight band graphic equalizer lets set frequency range manually taste, allows create presets settings allows take one equalizers standard settings customize save (you want base preset pop music setting? add save still phones original pop setting well)N75 2 mp camera; step cu500's 1
3 beating matching Sync, Krazr, w810The N75 camera oriented like digital camera, besting cu500 others, matching others
The interior display measures 2
4 inches, bigger candybar displays others
The memory card, music lovers likely swap frequency, phones exterior
 CU500's behind battery really require use tweezers needlenose pliers get out
 Ball point pens don't even cu500
AN IMPORTANT CAUTION:While N75 rated 2 gigabyte micro sd memory card, cu500, others, phones read 2 gb cards, usually read 1 gb cards well
If N75 reads 2 gb memory card, it's hands winner won't swap cards often
 Remember, memory capacity one mp3 player ipod next pay money for
 

I bought phone Amazon cell phone plan promotion
 The transaction took complete (about 2 weeks) I got phone week ahead schedule low price bad
The activation number transfer went smoothly
 The phone works well except annoyances
 It many features I like Bluetooth, web browser, mp3 music player, nice camera, bright display user friendly configurable
 You easily load ring tones, music & image files contacts using included PC software cable (or use Bluetooth)
This phone would perfect except frustrating bugs (or "features")
If turn phone off, turning back challenge
 If changed certain combination phone settings (I still don't know yet), error restart
 Then press 3 magic buttons (Talk * End) power reset it
 Sometime, startup fine menu like "settings->config
" won't work
 Luckily, phone Off-Line profile used flight without turning off
 I've found magic buttons pressed right Nokia flash screen Cingular fire-ball, start successfully time
 Sometime, taking battery restarting help
The phone 45Mb free memory I tried use listen chapters audio book time replace another set chapters I'm done
 However, I found play music file loaded phone's internal memory, able delete it
 The way delete soft reset (*#7780#) power (but see issue)
I'm holding phone hopping Nokia release software update fix issues soon
UPDATE (08/05/2007):I found included Nokia PC Suite software works well
 The N75 connects PC easily using Bluetooth I use Windows Explorer manage address book transfer images, music, ring-tones from/to phone
 I'm pleased works WinXP SP2 using CSR Bluecore dongle default driver
I've also used phone's music player listen audio book
 I place pause extended period time get back I was
 I still problem deleting files I've listened I've found sometime deleted viewing artist album
I've used Jabra 350 620s bluetooth head set phone
 However phone support stereo mostly good listening audio books talking music
Power wise, I usually charge phone every 4 days I barely used it
 I charge every day I lot talking playing music (for 2-3 hours)
Here features I've come like: large buttons, bright screen, predictive text entry, customizable short cut buttons, good reception (I live weak signal area)
I've come like phone I figured get around it's quirks
 

got phone 2 weeks ago really like took couple days get figured internet really fast esp w 3g conn
 bad part (thats 4 stars) come w/ headset kinda cheap headset easy find
other really nice phone
by way upgraded sony erricson w810i think camera alot better sony even though they're 2 mega pixel
upgrade 09/01/2007this phone pretty good, battery life mmmmm kinda pffft 3G awesome, camera NOT GOOD 2MP sony erricson alot better
on W810 used take pics take mem card stick printer print pics came awesome N75 edit pics better quality
upgrade 12/09/2007 guys guess ?i switched back sony erricson w810ithe nokia n75 consbattery lifecamera qualityease usemusic playermemory cardthe best thing N75 3G averagei made mistake getting phone
 

I agonized getting phone several months, mainly people saying weak battery
 But boy wrong
 This phone rocks
 The battery easily holding charge, reception great, phone cool, screen fabulous, features unbeatable
 Basically, NOKIA N75 "smart phone", means comes loaded tons applications
 In addition, AT&T/Nokia also provide CD disk, well data cable
 (Motorola not
) Sure, it's little fatter wife's RZR V3xx, isn't long, yes, it's bigger KRZR I dumped first one DOA 2nd started going bad one week
 But thing dynamite
 It's easy read screen, tons applications, important thing


 works phone
 I mean, come on, isn't main reason get cell phones anyway? We want talk them
 And easily best cell phone I ever had
 Run, don't walk, get one them
 

I ordered first N75 month ago
 I liked first two weeks later started problems
 The first problem caller id data external screen
 I later found downloaded themes won't display information external screen
 So I use Nokia AT&T; theme order get caller id
 No big deal
 About week later I set phone desk, inserted charger left hours
 When I returned I noticed big black spot external screen
 I could see even phone turned off
 It looked like quarter sized ink spot
 When I turned phone external screen jumbled lines running across big black spot
 So I returned it
 Now I phone #2
 The first thing I put SIM card battery plugged charger
 Nothing happened
 I noticed slight buzzing sound coming charger got really hot
 I tried another outlet nothing happened
 The screen phone said "Not Charging"
 I plugged charger first phone waiting returned thing happened, "Not Charging" msg appeared
 I switched two phones batteries thing happened
 I think faulty charger shorted phone batteries also fried SIM card
 I go AT&T; store get new SIM card
 So phone got returned I phone #3
 So far good


I really like phone it's working
 It's nice looking phone that's customizable
 My complaints far would top buttons close together hard push without pushing another one
 Also place SIM card goes bad spot
 I need tweezers remove it
 The battery seems little weak
 I need charge daily even I set packet data "when needed"
 Also I use downloaded theme I sacrifice caller id external screen so
 

I've looking phone worked well Mac
 I use Macs home business need synchronize contacts calendar mobile phone
 All mobiles I've tried used (not extensive quite few) either don't sync truncate data synchronization even worse, truncate reformat data corrupts data Mac
 Frustrated many attempts find right phone, I came across Nokia N75 Mac web site learned Nokia advocates working iSync (Mac's built-in synchronization tool) even provides drivers phone used Mac iSync
All all, I found N75 keeps ALL data calendar items (iCal) Address Book synchronizing really simple painless
 Using phone bit comprehensive took getting use I learned use it, I can't happier phone
The drawback phone short battery life
 I found full charge, I get maybe 2 hours talk time day 5:00 PM, I'm needing charge phone again
 So, I'm search high-capacity batteries stand-alone battery chargers I keep spare batteries handy
 I'm also making sure I chargers available I keep charged
 I charger home, one laptop bag one car now, I need sure I take call I'm shy battery power
Nice work Nokia please beef battery solution
 THANKS
 

I love functionality camera/video
 Once I purchased micro-memory card Costco, I able start taking alot pictures videos
 While video taping use volume button side phone zoom out, cool
 The phone also flash
 I like feature anyone calling contact list, rings whatever tone choose audibly states persons name, don't even pick phone, know want not
 My husband contractor busy, enjoys feature much
 We still exploring features, definately purchased camera/video takes alot photos jobs
 This way doesn't need carry camera, one
 Because high minutes user, I think tends charge everynite, unlike former nokia 6102 could go couple days
 I think new N75 full 3G service uses battery power
 So counts car charger needed
 

I got two days think I try stop others make mistake
The phone good looking, I mean big display, camera music







however, battery life short,even I don't make many calls, mention I haven't used web browsing, vedio etc fancy functions
 Becareful want buy phone
 

I techy budget, hoping get phone one-time cost without pay additional monthly fees
 I happy N75 first 5 days, worked
The first phone faulty battery cover, I got chance exchange it, battery fell purse longer functional, I couldn't even turn phone charge it
 (This turned horrible experience warranty department well asurion insurance, since I told didn't count warranty error may physical damage


from purse


but that's another review altogether
)Then I received replacement, pretty good phone weeks
 I never dropped it, never sat it, never ANYTHING I'm aware harm it, literally overnight, screen shattered
 I set alarm, put bedside table, went bed functional phone
 I woke screen shattered clear focal point knowledge never touched, making believe phone must extremely sensitive damage; option I come purse bedside table possessed
 So screen broke, STILL without physical beatings I'm aware of, days functionality address book stopped working - I dial number call anyone
 Also longer answer consistently, end calls consistently
 (And stupid warranty, said physical damage warranty wouldn't cover - means that, within 2 months getting phone, I've less 1 month working phone, insurance year completely used - next one doesn't work, I buy new phone dime even though I tried hardest take care phones)
The battery life horrible, wouldn't bother much gave enough warning - first warning beep, minute frantically find charger plug inadvertently ending call
 The music player goes constantly pocket purse (although that's partly fault remembering lock phone regularly)
 The placement camera button awful, I generally take several pictures accident per phone call
 I buy crappy proprietary headphones use music player, choose wired headset
 The picture quality really bad, matter many pixels claim
 And course, importantly experience, phones tend break unexpectedly ways warranty cover
 I love Nokias, I hate demon phone
Bottom line - don't buy phone
 There plenty phones capabilities better functionality actually work


 

read two links cell phone forum useful especially bought n75 like love phone hate battery life and/or at&t;'s crippling phone stereo bluetooth, able choose network you're on, opposed forced use 3g/umts
 biggest battery drainer, umts, web browsing umts network
 highly recommend reading two links, decide "de"brand phone, set GMS only
 want higher speeds web browsing switch back umts, sucks battery dry pretty quick
 anyways, links


[


]do note "de" brand phone, meaning flashing firmware state bought phone straight manufacturer thus taking XXXXX carrier's bs phone, unlock phone
 get phone unlocked at&t; free subject covered links
 

This phone incredible camera (2mp) video recording splendid
 The texting little difficult get used little get hang it
 The battery life incredible, one charge last two days
 The speaker phone call loud clear sounding
 The music player one best I've ever phone
I highly recommend phone
 

I bought AT&T; 2 yr contract
 It 1 yr 3 months now
 I completely disappointed entire deal
 I used, Sony Erricson T610 + TMobile, Nokia 6600 + TMobile, Moto Razr V3 + TMobile, past
 So, I've experiences mind commenting this
Pros:1
 Maps - nice
 Nokia maps non-trivial app I found useful
 But again, singular characteristic N75
2
 Text Speech - quite helpful
 This speaks caller's name
3
 Sound volume - good - whether earpiece speaker
 Much better non-Nokia phones
One may wish include features as, pdf reader, flash player, real player, FM radio, Lifeblog, 3D Tones, 


as pros
 But frankly, I never used them
 Hence, superfluous
Cons:1
 Power consumption / battery life - simple horrible
 The new battery used last 90 minutes talktime
 Now hardly lasts 15 minutes

 With 1 yr nokia warranty, I stuck power hungry brick another 9 months
2
 Reception quality - I don't know blamed AT&T; I experience decent number dropped calls
3
 Bluetooth - The 'file transmission' mode bluetooth stopped working months
 The hands-free mode, thankfully, works still
4
 Camera - 2 MP camera sucked
5
 Flip fold - flimsy
 Actually I surprised lasted long
 It feels come apart day
6
 3G - lets face it, voice transmission useless
 Those "data transmission" needs might found use it
 But way turn 3G, battery life greatly reduced
7
 Weight - higher end scale
8
 Firmware - Nokia, realized "bastard" nature product, abandoned it
 No updates, improvements
All all, extremely cheap stint poorman's smartphone US
 I ascribe call quality AT&T
; But others, Nokia blame
 This certainly satisfy smartphone customer
 This also satisfy (regular) non-smartphone customer
 This phone one
What I learnt? Even Nokia produce worthless products
 For future: I'll switch back TMobile (or Verizon) hunt phone core purpose fancy features
 

I've phone year still absolutely love it
 It huge improvement ways compared motorolla I previously
 I tote thing around pocket, certainly isn't best way go, held marvelously
 The finish outside still flawless, buttons inside still shine
 Call quality great, I haven't issues battery time, I generally charge nightly occasionally skip day don't problems
 I love keypad phone, buttons big smooth, I large hands text speed light phone, quickly sliding thumb smooth surface keys giving slightest press moving on
 My favorite feature course uses Symbian OS lots lots options software add-ons phone
 From file managers, personal accounting programs
 My used add-ons e-book readers
 I've packed slew e-books onto memory card something read matter I am
My complaints phone music player I never use can't get rid of, gets activated fairly often keys outside phone
 Unfortunately doesn't seem way automatically lock keys flip closed
 You use power button scroll choose key lock, hassle every time
All-in-all wonderfully solid, quality, useful phone open ended possibilities features add-on
 I hoping one lasts years come, I think I'd hard pressed find better flip phone there
 

I'm 3rd one I'm worried problem I previous two happen final replacement warranty
PROS - The phone sturdy good user interface
 The software easy navigate many features
CONS - Camera almost worth using
 Slow shutter times pictures worse I manage old school RAZR
 Phone gets hot decent length conversation
 Tied charger conversations lasting 45 minutes
MAJOR PROBLEMS


1st Phone - The phone despite careful damage would shut off
 I missed several phone calls this
 Also SIM card would "pop" it's place would cause loose service randomly
 I called AT&T; phone replaced
2nd Phone - Almost right bat phone problems
 Usually close flip phone call end begin open it
 About half time would supposed even verifying settings properly set
 I could almost handle stated thing first phone did
3rd Phone - No problems yet keeping fingers crossed month left warranty
 

I'm hardly power-user; I really need phone talking
 Color surprised I forgot charge battery one evening phone died next afternoon; I couldn't talked 45 minutes total
 Simply atrocious battery life; it's far worse three-year-old Motorola, replaced
 I really regret purchase
 

I've phone 8 months now
 I got back free, new contract
 The initial firmware botched headache
 After I got old firmware (I paid someone load original nokia firmware), works like charm
 Also, AT&T; great giving unlock codes
What say battery life sadly true
 I remedy car charged USB charger always charging
 It's little bit pain, it's great phone, loud speakers, lots memory, fast, big keypad
 

We bought 2 best range home Maine summer
 The back mine would stay on
 When I called, said replacement phone skelaton include back


 How phone include back goes phone? I called Nokia sent new back ( I still waiting, takes 7 - 10 days) I called back offered purchase back sent overnight
 They HAVE THAT CAPABILITY


 Nokia? The phone company? My new phone scotched taped


 Meanwhile, husbands back would go I removed speaking Nokia people removing battery
I went AT&T store salesman told backs bend prongs "skeleton phone" back pushed hard lock it


 Not part phone huh? I cannot get anyone anything
 I 1 1/2 years left contract 2 backs taped phones


 When new back comes in, maybe fit


 maybe not
 Do buy it
 Nokia insists never seen happen


 AT&T service person says happens time anything


 

Great phone
 The reviews elaborate this
 I want share issues arisen phone
 I N75's cover display set show caller ID answering calls upon opening
 However, phone intermittently switches flip phone open see caller ID press key answer
 Randomly, switch back original setting


and back forth on
 That's big deal, little detail frustrate people (especially me
)
 The flaw microphone arbitrarily stops working without cause
 I'll completed phone conversation - put phone - ring - I answer caller hears nothing


but I hear fine
 Wanna talk frustrating


especially since happened 3 times
 I'm second phone this


would third I'm 15 day window phone replaced in-store
 Oh ya, I got phone warranty folks


they phone want permanently replace phone lesser model (from different company) remainder contract
 Are stupid? Buyer beware phone
 Hopefully won't encounter problems phone really nice overall
 

Europe Asia put us shame comes carrier-offered phones
 If want really good, do-it phone US, way go unlocked, usually means getting one sans-warranty
 This first phone I seen feature-set match high-end phones available unlocked


amazing screen, excellent expansion options (both memory applications), high-speed data connections - e-mail, web browsing, sending mms messages - excellent build quality (Motorola never touch Nokia this)
 Quad-band, work anywhere GSM signal
 Props Cingular/AT&T finally bringing goodness US
 

Just return battery life horrible
 Overall, phone amazing

 I users site said (changing 3G setting needed instead available) still battery drained matter hours
 I KRZR now


not cool N75, least battery still going
 

I love phone
 I switched Nokia 6681 Nokia N75 I could pleased
 While 6681 plagued firmware problems would switch reboot time, N75 issues
 I love music player
 Even though I iPod I using player lot due convenience carry another device
 The Nokia browser hidden Tools folder awesome
 I love preview feature browser provides
 This lets preview large web page zoom section want
 The 3G connection DSL decent speed probably 56K modem experience
 But good enough browsing would expect phone
 I find big difference speed 3G GPRS connections
 The camera decent
 I took pictures daughter's soccer game test came quite well
 This sleek stylish phone features I need
 The reason I give 4 stars battery life tad short compared earlier Nokia 6681 I also find 6681 better signal reception N75
 Could larger size 6681
 

I hesitated abandon Nokia candy bar phone
 It easy pull use
 But I needed FM radio, combination radio/phone came I jumped ship
 It's thin flip
 Pocketable (which I usually carry mine)
I'm pleased N75
 I use primarily phone, messaging device, radio
 Which polite way confessing I still luddite compared electronic whizzes there
 Still, thoughts:POP port: My initial hate POP port converted love
 I like blocks dirt lint, adds sleekness phone
 My headset stays firmly attached, even I stick phone pocket cord attached
Camera: lower color quality I expected
 It's really party-cam grand scheme things here
 And even then, there's long delay pressing button image capture
Radio: Love FM radio
 All phones it
 I listen morning NPR train now
 And gym requires FM radio television audio
Also: made Finland 
 
 
 like old times
 

For u problems phone turning ON pocket din know lock keys outside


here solution


 u press power button u get option lock keypad


 select lock keypad way dont worry battery draining pocket


 accept fact battery life N75 great Nokia phone


 But I thot locking phone pocket saves lot battery


 I charge phone everyday :(


 But overall excellent phone


U dont get good phone offered provider FREE


 

Nokia produces many high end multimedia phones provides almost Zero accessory support audio headsets
When I went local cell phone store buy headphone adapter Nokia phone
 I told salesperson I would buy parts build own
 When I looked online one I found information
I would build parts
Is Nokia's customer service?First N75 Not stereo bluetooth capability
 How possible costly phone? After contacting Nokia July 2007 I told would Never offer upgrade N75
 It never stereo Bluetooth
 You always use wired headset listening music
Second
I disappointed find stereo headset Not included new phone all
 For costly phone advertised versatile audio player, stereo headset included far company like Nokia
Third
This phone proprietary 'pop port' allows use poorly made Nokia headphone
 I can't use earbud headphone hurts ear
 Further, I universally told Nokia headphone units produce poor quality sound
Fourth
The ONLY 'pop port' standard headphone adapter ever made NOT available anywhere
 NOBODY carries it, anywhere
 Further, I seen non-existent unit shows poor design
 It's bulky, big square connector box
After purchasing expensive phone Nokia idea could used listen music
 I left NO options usable headphone unit
 ?
?I forced buy soldering iron, 3
5mm female mini-jack HDS-3 headset make 'pop-port' standard headphone jack adapter
 Which way able use Quality headphone unit cause pain ears
I haven't able find following information anywhere
 Is HDS-3 headphone unit's 'pop-port' connector compatible N75 phone? I can't even tell headphone units compatible
 I found Nokia data cables cross compatible phone models, I'm sure headphones
 I E-mailed Nokia customer support
It's pathetic Nokia can't use standardized USB 3
5mm female mini-jacks phones
 Why make hard customers? Just little profit?---I also disappointed Symbian software phone
s60 version 3 backward compatible s60 v
1 v
2Most software far made v
2 don't expect many port v
3The layout design menu system chaotic jumbled little option customization
 In end best customize menu system layout phone leaves one frankenstein like system
 Better original layout, still extremely annoying
 Half total menu options entire system designed access private general 'Pay' internet services
 I interest using phone internet
 But I forced leave menu options phone
I guess I heard I expected Symbian & Nokia (ironically Symbian produced Nokia)
I won't buying another phone Nokia
 

I got N75 plan Cingular, believe worst Nokia phone I ever used
 In span 4 months, I get replaced phone used get switched automatically
 The new phone also similar phones
 With even minor shocks LCD goes phone goes without warning
 I highly recommend spending money better phone getting stuck poor performance phone 2-year contract
 

N75-All reviews I read right on
 I really liked phone
 It alot
 However I 16 months 24 month contract phone held up
 It never dropped always protected case
 I Nokia Fan
 Every phone I ever nokia (about 6 now)
 However, also candybar phones
 The draw back phone "flip hinges cheap" crack break mine are
 Currently, mine elecrical taped together trying wait contract I get another phone
 This time probably Nokia 4300
 Smart phone


smart get another flip phone ever
 I wouldn't discourage someone getting phone
 The features great
 Just don't buy gentle phone
 It wont last
 

I love style N75, quality poor
 I accidentally dropped once, entire top (the part flip open) cracked
 It held Gorilla glue moment, I hope lasts
I like user friendly easy navigate, even bit "slow"
I'll switching something else next summer next upgrade
 

Within first month owning phone I dropped house (NOT hard floor)
 No crack scratch there
Weeks letter crack started forming eventually hinge coming apart
As I researched online I discovered quite normal
 It happens often Nokia says it's customer abuse
Not true I know ABUSE phone LOL, I never abused phone
Obviously would fix mine, would Cingular
I disappointed great features, great ringtone etc


and I glue 2 continue using it
Do get phone, research online find many others problem hinge Nokia refuses admit it's theire problem
 

Many reviewers list pros, personal feeling cons far outway these
 Here list problems:1) While keys large, navigation ones small hard press
2) Non-intuitive interface, hard navigate find looking for3) Battery meter goes almost full dead within minutes4) Large bulky without redeeming features, size taken keypad
5) Horrible miserable cameraBeing 1 cell phone manufacturer seems corrupting Nokia
 Their phones used solid, clean, easy use
 You could go wrong choosing them
 Alas, miserable device, (if ever pretends to) dream competing iPhone
[Edit] To top off, phone died
 It wasnt dropped, used much
 Nokia ashamed themselves
 

I purchased phone new AT&T
; It functioned flawlessly long I owned it, one big exception
Pros:Good responsiveness
You open number PC file formats
You synch contacts number things PC easily included software
The PC software works well Windows XP seems like quality software
Bluetooth works flawlessly
Memory expandable
Cons:MP3 playback/organization, etc, best, survivable
Do expect able flip open? Good luck yours, hinge lasted approximately 6 months, appears known issue (although Nokia/ATT seem consider design flaw, I'm starting repair process - we'll see)
Update:They fix broken hinge without charging
 You may well get new phone price asking
 Anyway, I replaced mine Blackberry, Blackberry's battery lasts several days N75's
 

I phone past 3 months
 I weakness flap phones best available free signing 2 years contract
 I happy see I received 3 months I came across many flaws related design related software makes annoying many times
 I ignored others reviews I buying I think people shouldnt make mistake others did

 Thats first time I writing review Amazon product
 certain things I terribly annoying specific particular phone I many models Nokia companies never type problems I faced one

1) This phone many times doesnt play ringtone incoming call
 So keep vibration always 

 You going miss call party traveling

2) Response time keypad sound typing Unknown number want call terribly big

 It annoys I clicked keypad sound I would kept otherwise
3) Now screen crappy mobile goes disconnect call I cant redial connect another call unless I close flap
 Its damn annoying get call waiting want person hold

4) The option keeping different ring tones different persons doesnt work phone doesnt play ringtones many times plays plays tone

5) Its difficult attach handsfree music headphone mobile

 always feel break delicate part connecting them

 want buy mobile listen music thn bluetooth headphone

There positives

1) Sound quality impressive2) Camera works fine3) style goodI would recommend buying phone

 Its damn annoying times

 well make decision

 

I'm glad wasn't dislike phone

1) SOOOO SLOW
 There many situations I reply someone immediately (both phone text) phone didn't respond quick enough
 It weird delayed reaction
 I'm talking delayed 30secs
2)Freezes
 A LOT
3)Just plain ugly
 I went Razr this
 The phone seemed thick
 And I mention it's ugly?4)Buttons front get pushed accidentally backpack
 I'm sure way lock three front keys, I never figured to
 The phone comes weird song, song would play middle front button pushed
 Almost got phone taken away school many times
 

I love phone, outside speakers good sound, plays music, nice camera stuff I need
 Two things may careful outside lq display
 easy damage claim warrenty, answer dropped it
 The hings seem little loose flip, they'll probably hold up
 Overall I like it, next one next N series up
 

I thought wonderful phone cracked joint bottom end screen
 So I called manufacture said don't cover cracking joint warranty void
 So decide buy phone talk lot it, know also happen you
 BTW I phone 10 months happened
 

The Nokia N75, perfect phone, good
 It isn't smallest phone, excessively large
 When compared size RAZR, length closed, double length opened, RAZR half thick
 It wide RAZR well
I much prefer large size big screens
 I came MOTORAZR V3, difference screens operating systems like night day
 This phone HUGE step up
One thing I don't really like slow processing phone
 The battery life problems easily fixed change packet data settings
One major plus ability easily download install 3rd party programs phone
 The music player, may good dedicated music player, excellent
 The menus straight forward, phone intensely customizable
 I doubt 2 customized N75 look alike
For go back Motorola phone, would make new OS scratch
 They using OS minor tweaks probably 6 7 years now
 

Pros:Really cool phone
 Nice OS amazing tabbed display option
Battery bad great
I changed packet option 'when needed' 'always' helps batteryNice music playerCons:OS bit slow
 Response sometimes sluggish
had issues real player files workingagain said battery great


 dont xpect 3 days widout charging


 

I got phone gift BF, husband
 Within 5 months, I've 3 replacements phone
 It freezes whenever pleases, pardon rhyming, half time I'd seem like prank caller person I'm calling could hear me
 It's embarrassing especially I call church work random store
 The thing fix prob turn phone again, real hassle you're hurry emergency
 Sadly, latest unit still defective, I'm tired calling customer service shipping bruhaha get another phone could worse one I'd sending back
 Buy risk
 













































































































































































































This phone bit difficult get US I bought months ago
 I ended getting eBay
 I extremely happy it
 Here things I like:- Records audio video- High resolution, compact color screen- Supports WiFi, use snoop WiFi without starting laptop- Unlocked, uses GSM sim cards (so bound one cellular provider
)- Good web browser- Runs Symbian s60v3, integrates GMail client- Looks like (slightly big) regular candy-bar phone, open it, wham, there's QWERTY keyboard
 For me, fastest text entry method- Good reception, similar old Sony Ericsson T28, MUCH better Motorola v330 I tried
- Keys backlight start typingNegatives:- The little joystick hard press straight without moving side
 It's command button lot things, annoying get used it
 Also, paint started wearing joystick weeks
- The screen high resolution, sometimes I wish bigger
- The voice recorder button side sticks out, I always hitting accidentally making voice recordings
I'm extremely happy it
 If get one, I recommend get screen protector protect purchase
 

The E70 incredible
 It took long time finally get hands on, bit pricey compared free phones give out, it's worth it
I Cingular wireless (w/ Unlimited Medianet) able simply swap SIM card start using right away
 I installed Exchange ActiveSync Contacts/Email/Tasks/Calendar synched within minutes
 It's incredibly ridiculously convenient
The installed applications fantastic: fact I receive email instantally (just like Blackberry) view PDF/Word/etc attachment (the resolution screen impressive) reply back within minutes, anywhere, worth money
It "every" feature some
 Just read manual/product page
The downside I've found phone I've come expect much it
 IT much (from compose Word docs browse web real browser) I sometimes think I'm real computer, expect able "real computer" things, like Copy/Paste across applications, taskbar, etc
 But it's phone 


 pad paper handy (to say, write non-linked phone number webpage need call) easily overcome
 

This first fancy phone, I'm impressed
 It's nice solid phone, big heavy, packed features
It's fine cellphone good sound quality usable speakerphone
The mobile versions Gmail Google Maps work well
 The built-in web browser pretty good
 I also tried Opera download, works OK, I prefer built-in browser
The camera surprisingly good -- I didn't buy camera, works great daylight shots, point I probably stop using (older) camera entirely
The screen, sharp, bit small eyes
The keyboard gigantic improvement keypad text input, though still far worse laptop course
Wifi works well web browsing & email
I impressed built-in Voip features -- selling point me, it's clear it's quite ready prime time
 I eventually get SIP account configured, struggle, end result satisfying
 My main problem incoming SIP calls would usually ring phone, instead going straight voice mail
 I better luck Fring (a third-party downloadable app) also supports Skype Google Talk, Voip phone, workable cheap, still far convenience reliability regular cellular voice
I happy phone music player
 Sound quality great, 2GB Mini SD card, capacity pretty good
 My main quibble I buy adapter order use regular headphones
[


] 

I happy phone far, I month now
 I picked E70 keyboard - it's pretty much thumb-typing like Blackberry, except less crowded
 I loaded Putty (an SSH client) right away without much difficulty, I easily connect work perform systems administration duties Unix servers
The screen good resolution I problems reading webpages, ssh console, etc
 The web browser surprisingly full featured load sites except I yet get Flash working
My gripe times tad slow loading closing applications
 However, may design issue buttons multiple functions (e
g
 press button A button B enable feature X)
 

Generally, I happy e70, I bought two weeks ago replacement aging 6200, also full QWERTY folder
 I agree rave reviews above, need point something driving bit nuts: housing designed poorly, noticeable flex rear casing behind earpiece (right put index finger)
 The result squeaking calls holding phone ear
 I confirmed design flaw, returning one handset different supplier buying Amazon: problem
 I suspect may fix sufficient patience right tools, seems bit silly add plastic $400 phone
Other this, I minor issues: red 'disconnect' button close space bar, I killed many text message typing
 Also, phone terrible playing video: I converted videos using Nokia's software, play handset
 Lastly, 'doing' e-mail, phone seems break GPRS connection every data action, constantly asking wait reconnects (every time I send e-mail, example)
A couple notes: Nokia requires purchase receipts show IMEI number order get full warranty service - Amazon *NOT* provide receipts/invoices
 After repeated messages Amazon, eventually refunded $80 purchase I could buy warranty third party
 Make sure same
 

I started working new company I would need keep cell phone times
 My company offered pay company phone give pay allowance
 The requirement pay allowance I accessible phone business hours
 My current provider didn't get service office I went looking new phone WLAN capabilities
 I found E70 The Best Page Universe
 I ordered immediately
 I ended Downloading application called Fring phone I could use googletalk IM tech buddies with, I could use Skype company could reach VoIP
 It worked VoIP quality ranged often bad good
 Also phones volume could louder
 I really like list apps available overall, running many apps causes freeze run slow
 Then don't plan using skype's video feature
 Withe camera places back phone, won't able watch somebody watch time
The 3 rating I give probably I expect little much Technology today seeing places world better
 

I bought phone year ago upgrade trusted Nokia 6800
After year usage, phone still amazes provides surprises time time
 I could pretty much say one best phones made Nokia, matter, cellular phone manufacture
 It's incredible thinking came phone back year 2006, almost 5 years ago
 The included software suite comprehensive, enabled phone view various Microsoft Office Adobe documents
 I've installed applications make phone functions GPS navigation unit, full blown multimedia player, remote SSH client, e-Book reader, mobile gaming unit
 The best part product `Winged' keyboard design, making composing SMS writing memo chore
 IN 2010, sells $100 ebay used, worth every penny
Well done, Nokia
 Please continue line 6800/E70 design
 

When I originally got phone, I LOVED it
 I ended selling buy original iPhone shortly purchase, build-quality aesthetics phone amazing
 Not much feature-phone days, still nice piece technology (3 years ago


) 

I really enjoyed phone, especially latest firmware update
Responsive, powerful, customisable: It pleasure use
 The camera good spontaneous snapshots, I read books, play, listen music it


 It become gadget pocket
 



I've bought many car chargers internet
 This first one I've bought didn't work
 Of course destroy plastic order get can't return anymore
 It lights up, doesn't actually charge phone
 

This exactly you'd expect car charger
 Simple effective
 Mine hasn't failed come handy couple occasions phone battery went done travelling
 Good buy
 



The battery new looks exactly original battery
 I charged first, take long get fully charged
 You trust Amazon
 

I recived fast
 I use cell phone
 Very happy it
 
























I tried phone new Cingular connection month found wanting
 The primary difficulty volume
 Although I kept turning volume up, sound improve, I could barely hear conversations
 Thinking problem might inadequately charged battery, I charged unit overnight
 But sound level still poor next morning
When I returned Cingular store next day, clerk said complaint unit common one
 Be warned
There case happy ending: I returned phone even exchange happy Samsung model I obtained replacement
 

This phone good free upgrade; it's great
 It good reception dropped calls, nice display, easy navigate
 I cover mine dropped times without incident
The good features: FM radio (surprisingly good nokia headphone required), speakerphone (not bad small is), overall quality
 Easy-to-use camera rare photo use, picture quality average
The bad: Difficult see display outdoors (cover display monochrome one could read it), limited ringtone options, backlight goes way soon
If you're getting free upgrade, suffice couple years long primary use cell phone
 As such, fine; added features nice well
 

This nice small phone doesn't take whole face you're talking
 picture quality great different customizing options cool
 i'm 15 got phone birthday it's good gift teenagers people ages
****UPDATE****When phone breaks down


the phone breaks
 It doesn't hold well dropped
 After couple months, I two pieces one whole phone
 

I'll admit worst phone I've ever owned, it's really great
 I wish I actually played I bought it, I purchased I needed something cheap temporary
 I guess I got I paid for
Before I go annoyances, I say couple good things phone
 First all, speaker loud, especially mp3-type ringer
 I also think camcorder feature pretty cool, even it's high quality, it's feature generally see type phone
 I also like it's compact without overly fragile
 And looks lot better Nokia flip-phones I've seen
Now bad stuff
 My main problem phone menu system
 It's much different Nokia phones except there's even confuse you
 To put perspective, I SELL cell phones living
 I play phones day long I usually know everything given phone within days
 Yet I phone personally five months I still trouble navigating menu
 First all, names various menus confusing oftentimes misleading; example, "Tools" phones would find calculator, calender, etc
 On phone it's hide camera, radio, voice recorder
 The camcorder, however, menu
 The way get camcorder open camera first go "options" menu
 There menu "profiles" I also seen Nokia phones I yet figure relevence
 I'm thinking might way make ringer louder quieter, would great deal simpler could volume control
 The address book halfway menu page instead right front rightfully be
 But really worst thing menus fact usually go many different little submenus get actual function, options choose always obvious
Now less important things bug me
 The camera really bad
 I don't necessarily think camera essential function phone have, it's going one least able take something resembles actual picture
 The biggest problem move even slightest bit you're trying take picture turn blurry
 Should manage take picture worth saving, may notice zoom it
 But AFTER you've already taken picture, before
 Furthermore, can't save picture zoomed-in state
You also can't set different ringers different phone numbers, feature I really come take granted cell phone frustrates end I can't one
 You set different ringer messages voice calls (although can't distinguish voicemail text) took ages figure set message ringer something I downloaded rather one default ones
Overall, I think phone would fine someone planned use voice calls nothing else
 For anyone else, favor spend 10 20 bucks get something better; plenty options
 

This good cell phone Amazon
com gives best deal
 But, can't transfer old phone number different provider Cingular Amazon
com
 If transfer old phone number, won't get mail-in rebate
 Please read amazon
com mail-in rebate rules carefully


You read transfer number link : http://www
amazon
com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/508597/102-6686881-6992121 

Frankly, I wish I free Nokia brick phone I one back
 Call volume horrid
 Many times I barely hear person I'm speaking, many times person hear background noise better hear me
 Lots dropped calls
 The OS slow pain navagate
If Cingular salesperson steers toward one, find something else
 

I upgraded Nokia 6102 phone Nokia fell toilet accident (which little intact kept dying randomly)
 I always hated flip phones easy break snap half accidentally drop lid popped up
 I used Samsung flip phone time lid become lose eventually broke
 This Nokia phone, however, month antenna black piece popped off
 It looks like held glue (NO SCREWS

)
 The quality good I thought would be
 When I flip open phone joints open phone seem lose month
 Also, basic speaker great--I hard time hearing someone car there's little noise around
 The speakerphone actually powerful normal speaker
 I definitely going back Nokia 3595


This great basic phone don't worry breaking
 Cingular offered replace send new Nokia 6102, I refuse another
To summarize everything:PROS:-Camera (don't care one since I new camera takes better quality pics cameraphones)-Speakerphone (loud clear, convienent driving
-easy read screen-double-screened-good battery life-Easy handle (not small, bulky)-Radio (can't use unless I buy headphones though)-Video (never really use it, don't care it)-Voice recording (you make ring tones want)CONS:-Volume level LOW basic speaker-Not enough default themes/backgrounds choose from
 Older phones choices
-When scrolling Contact List, anything matter, seems delayed matter quickly press buttons
-ANTENNA PIECE IS A MAJOR DEFECT IN PHONE
 It falls gentle use (never dropped)I generally don't good experiences flip phones, I going back basic one without unneccessary features
 Plus they're durable, reliable, better quality price
- 

This phone great
 It kinds Voice activated things, dialing sending messages
 For alarm clock tone, It's voice saying "WAKE UP

 WAKE UP

" How cool that
 Oh well definitely beats phone (Motorola v220- "NO hello moto")(^_^) 

After reading reviews site many sites
 I thought Nokia 6102 good one
 However, turned pretty bad phone
 I'm disappointed
I signed 2 year contract - Family plan Cingular, month one week ago
 Grabbed 3 phones
My phone:Pros: I frustrated experienced bad things mind went blank pros
 Well, actually things camera, PC connectivity, speakerphone, dual screen, games I'm fancy type guys I don't need features much
Cons:+ No setting backlight, dim 15 seconds
 Only able set permanent ON CHARGING, that's ridiculous
+ There delay pressing Menu key+ Low memory+ Very ringtones, themes (but I need 3)+ Background noises, static way exceptable level
+ Poor reception+ Connection drops frequentlyThe top 4 cons, I don't care much, I deal last 3 killing me
 Anytime I use phone, I want smash hammer
And I conclude bad?I borrowed 2-year old Nokia 6200 alike (not flipfone) coworker, swapped simcard, old phone performed 10x even 20x better 6102
I've lived Andover, MA - Nashua, NH areaI tested Seales Rd, 6102 showed network coverage, old phone worked problem
Background noise (static) occurs everytime 6102 old one fine (I tested every street)
In places, 6102 shows reception old one indicates 2 3 bar
I've tried phones (same model 6102), works little better still far behind old Nokia
First, I thought 6102 problem, could defective unit tried twice, I think whole Nokia 6102 series problem
 While lot people graded high star, I disappointed
I'm thinking buying Motorola RAZR V3 even buy back old Nokia I tested cowoker
 Just can't stand little crappy 2 years
 My concern right RAZR better old Nokia not? Sign
 

I bought 4 phones I switched family plan AT&T Cingular
 The salesman said got great reception could break dropped
 Just 4 days 30-day return policy expired, small plastic piece covering half antenna top phone fell 2 4 phones -- even though weren't dropped
 On son's phone, noticed one day piece gone
 On phone, came I took phone back pocket
 The Cingular store couldn't exchange it, 30-day free exchange period, told call Warrantee Center
 They wouldn't replace phone broken piece counts "physical damage," voids warrantee, unless Nokia issued advisory problems piece breaking (which Cingular salesman said gotten several complaints about)
 Nokia said aren't authorized send replacement phone either, first I'd send two phones back assess whether problem created "physical liquid damage," even fault poor manufacturing, I may end pay repair phones
 After spending several hours phone Nokia Cingular, I still trying get send replacement phones
 

Nokia 6102 FLIMSY phone
 I phone 3 days, time, screen froze, key pad froze flip part felt like going break half
 AND, volume horribly low ear isn't right spot wont hear anything all
 Horrible ring tone options GPRS connection NO way order ring tones
I returned phone even chance run batteries
 

Nokia's new, compact flip easy use navigation come expect leader mobile devices
 The clarity dual screens optimal VGA camera acceptible
 The volume control little weak side don't expect hear whole lot crowded room
 The speakerphone, however, exceptional
 The navigation buttons easy push - quite possibly easy particularly you've got larger fingers
 The alarm clock allows customizing snooze :) Ringtones okay, polyphonic tones bit tinny probably due smaller chord range mid-range cellphones
 As Nokia's customizing liking snap
 The backlight turns means could middle something shuts down
 It active-flip necessary press extra buttons answer end call
 The phones come PTT button - feature isn't yet available
 No bluetooth infrared sufficient
 General feel phone nice fit feel little cheap side
 Reasonably price low mid-range phone
 

If always wanted Nokia didn't want get candy-bar style one you
 Great battery life, Reception nice style
 For international calls try http://tele3advantage
com don't waste money carrier international rates
 

These new generation phones gentle break easily
 Our two motorola's phones V180 V550 broke year used
 The common problem leaking screan drop phone, screan goes blind
 Go brand 



 

i've Nokia 6102 phone 2 1/2 months now
 When firsy got great, everything worked didnt problems
 Then started using often realised sending recieving text message recieving phone call, ur watchin TV listening radio, weird noise come TV radio's speakers

uncle got fone amazon saved lot money went buy cingular store sold for(


)
 

I read reviews 6102 felt I things add
 I agree phone could use memory, download Nokia's PC suite(off Nokia website), use media player change MP3 files true tone file format takes far less space sounds phone
 I would suggest program like Goldwave create Mp3 file clips
I 10 tones assigned groups plenty space left over
 Also FM radio great feature
 I bought headset ebay use I go walk
 The phone automatically pick call return radio caller hangs up
 I never move finger
 The camera basic, that's I needed phone
 I digital camera
 I don't find flimsy all
 I pleased coverage phone
 So far sound quality excellent speaker phone works belt clip
 I flip open phone press quick button talk, hands free
 The battery life excellent
 Overall, phone met expectations beyond
 

I always Nokia phones, I love, I getting envious flip-phones there
 When came time upgrade phone lower model Nokia, I excited find Nokia come great new flip-phone
 And I didn't think I would care camera video capability, I quickly learned love both
 This phone also ability record audio message sent someone used ringtone
 The design sleek, best all, Nokia features menus I'm used simply updated even smarter version phone
 This made easy learn use menus technological features phone offer
 

I bought phone two months ago

 course, came back on
 but, days later
 way cingular store accessories phone
 and, walked shut again
 made angry, screamed
 came back but, contacts, ringtones personal things somehow deleted
 so, consulted cingular worker
 told situation
 said "sorry, thats problem
 but, send new one
 free
" said sure
 next day, got new "free" phone
 went whole setup process
 indeed happy
 then, done
 put table
 then, light went and, went continuasly(can't spell) called cingular
 said thing
 so, next day
 turned phone on, started adding contacts
 said "please insert sim card" dumbfounded
 calld cingular (again) told them
 said was
 "what exactly happens" told them
 and, sent another phone
 thing

 fed up
 so, went online bought "untaged" model
 thing
 so, conclusion

Cons:Graphics, suck
 camera bad place
colume button * camera buttons worse place
dropped calls * calls interrupted
video quality good all
cannot hear
 voices get low loud vise-versa
calls go muteoverall give phone 3
 good reception
 easyness open
 

I've 6102 since December, I've absolutely problems all
 There complain speaker quality, mine pretty decent I didn't many problems all
 I disclaim I use headset time though review may good barometer comes speaker issue
 I problems navigation phone, adding tones pics data cable worked perfectly it, text messaging intuitive speedy 6102, T9 system one best I've used
 I also enjoy FM radio, good range get distant stations well
 The headset antenna, makes sense since it's regular Walkmans equivalents worked since creation portable stereo
However, downside phone large color front mini-screen, definitely want soft case it
 I learned hard way nasty meeting screen seatbelt buckle left inside plastic cracked nice big purple battery-sucking bruise LCD
 Unfortunately I went $2 plastic holster left protection phone, turned $115 error I pay full price new phone replace cracked screen Cingular considered cosmetic non-warranty damage
 I stomached loss money got new 6102, shortly thereafter got case offered plenty protection (and I intent pick extended coverage)
 It's cool looking phone everything well, comes extra complicated electronics, buy this, make second purchase good-quality soft case don't end six months later cracked phone went cheapest method carrying could get
 

Great phone
 Nothing super fancy
 FM radio good sound heard though ear bud headphones
 Have head phones hear FM radio
 I guess thats Nokias way getting buy accessories
 I suggest downloading free Nokia Sync software (


)
 I charge one time week, I don't use phone ton either old Motorola 720, piece crap, charged every 1
5 days
Highly recommend phone
 

The latest flip phone Nokia call basic phone added features reasonably low price
It 1 month since owned come across issues are1) battery status bar accurate
I took liberty charging phone 4 days looking bar showed 75% ,and 5th day went dead
But thankfully came alive charged overnight
So guess charged daily
2) It supports MP3 ringtones 4 MB memory
4mb? minimal phone support media mp3
3 pics 2 ringtones 


and memory full
I get rid nokia logos ringtones accomodate personal stuff
Anyway phone pretty okie would better memory card slot
Considering number free reasonably good phones available so-so deal
At least better earlier phone siemens flip phone
So guess 4 **** rating would like give it
 

I live mountains, recently got suckered cingular's renew plan two years get fresh new phone deal
 The phone arrived could activated home
with limited time I spent phone last night, The features complicated anti-intuitive
seems like progress last four years, camera, speakerphone, etc, antenna work well four year old Nokia Candy bar (can't remember number) looks like dragged behind truck several miles highway speed picked dog carried home
If live area spotty reception, forget phone cool upgrade offer
I expect spend several hours customer service trying sort flashy new phone
 

After months searching, I bought Nokia 6102 replace 3590
Wow - Nokia always make remarkable, solidly-built phones


Here features I like dislike
1
 Large outside color display I show date time photos2
 Inside color display bit small, large enough show calendar, needed give phone compact size
 If big hand, phone you
3
 Excellent voice quality
 Also speaker phone capability I sometimes find handy
 I walk talk phone cover closed
4
 Basic camera keeps entertained, though I initially buy phone capability
 This simple use anyone learn use instant
5
 Using infrared port, receive (and send) data files midi mp3 music keep entertained set ring tones
 There need data cable


 Be advised due limited memory, can't store much mp3 files
 Also, midi files playable
 I find infrared port work older Windows computer, newer one
6
 Battery needs recharging every 3-4 days, depending usage
 The charger small, portable
7
 Like previous mobile, set unique ring tones group contacts list
 This capability provided "Group Details"
8
 Basic voice recorder - though expect record quality live music using this
9
 FM radio, though I buy phone capability
 You need buy headset accessory use feature
 

I switched Nokia flip completely dissatisfied Motorola V551
 Anything could go wrong cell phone went Motorola, time change
 I go Cingular, hesitate free Nokia 6102 offered, I great experiences Nokias past
 In fact, since Moto gotten bad, I popped sim card older nokia (3 yrs) worked like charm
Pros phone include:-generous outside display - bigger phones I seen, megapixels good inside screen, can't win definitely works well-Sleek, black outside, refreshing standard cell phone silver way played out
-Menus easy navigate, I fing 2 second delay pulling main menu, definitely something I live with
-camera good, considering phone would buy specifically camera
-Construction sturdy - said nokia flips "cheap" feel way - one substantial, dense, big heavy
the cons I sometimes earpiece volume great
 even quieter settings I sometimes struggle hear person end, even vol
 max
 Also, may function area, I also hear static background times, like I said, may person's phone area I in
 Also, wallpapers images included few, best
 I believe 5 different wallpapers 3 themes, wish choice
I still within 30 day return period, I almost sure phone keeper - unless I many issues call volume
 This great all-around phone, good camera capabilities, easy menus, vibrant screen
 

Overall, good phone
 I avid fan nokia phones using since decade, but, first nokia flip phone, i'm dissappointed
 The phone great reception, also sustain calls dead zones earlier nokia phones went blank 
 Battery life seems alright 2-4 days charging cycle features like menus & IRDA euqivalent previous models
 Personally, I really dont dig flip phone part, otherwise, highly recommended phone basic concrete functionality cell phone minus bling bling similar motorola models
 

This review long rambling phone (to me) much describe rational order would much like work
So bottom line top: A great phone money, lot stuff perfectly adequately serves good training device someone wanting know look next time buy higher-end phone
 I give five stars because, "What expect twenty-dollar phone?"I got phone reluctantly, old-fashioned Nokia brick stolen
 I asked simply cheapest phone camera, I couldn't pleased
Well, actually, I could, picking nits
 So go:My first issue downloading photos, I shoot lot twenty-five cents piece email cable seemed like reasonable solution
 I wanted avoid spending $50
00 OEM, I tried one Ebay
 Then another
 Then another
 I called Nokia tech support, surprised talk someone knowledgeable accent
There separate issues here, first necessity downloading Nokia's "PC Suite" facilitate connectivity
 The version touted Windows 98 erratic longer offered supported, happened I finally got tech email admitting known problem
 And regard non-original cables sort DRM capabilities, tech sort chuckled said, "I really can't comment that"
 Not work, I uninstall reinstall app failed attempt
 How amusing
Realizing cost cable would paid back soon I ordered one Nokia almost immediately
 From problem, although I could use XP
The file transfer protocol bit odd, works OK
 The synchronization Outlook seemed flawless works directions
 The new automatic picture transfer completely empty images camera, including graphics, wallpaper screensavers, seems like mistake present earlier version
Removing SIM chip another phone save bare basic info, thoroughly scramble formatting you'd better cable
 You can't save games photos chip, either, I don't know phones enable this
Oh, games: No Tetris, I found favorite addictive one, "Zuma"
 The screen far small pleasant experience, it's novelty helps pass time waiting rooms
All features phone work adequately quite useful- stopwatch, countdown recorder, calendar, notepad, alarm clock, etc
 I spend days manual get understanding software made sense fairly quickly
 One unbilled feature display bright enough use flashlight nightlight stumbling around strange hotel room parking lot, gives enough glow see well
The phone features? Oh yeah, I hardly ever get calls, use I had, service OK
 You need hold speaker right next ear get best volume, I picked no-name headset/mike $8
00 fine
I live rural area canyon, Cingular consistently best signal here
 The hot spots around house different phone service messaging, slightly irritating I get missed call message right phone doesn't ring
 The camera works OK is- great catching rare moments still video
 Same audio recorder, I use notes catching info car radio
 A speaker phone seems work OK, playing music pretty much waste time
Not unlike writing review obsolete phone Amazon
 

I've read several reviews reporting insufficient volume phone
 I decided throw caution wind, order anyway
 When arrived I made first phone call, volume *little* soft
 I asked party hold sec, mashed Up button side phone times watching volume meter increase display, resumed conversation
 The next time person I called spoke, I couldn't believe it
 It clearly audible, slightly alarming
 Perhaps reviewers forgot peel protective shipping plastic off?Anyway, phone great
 It's tiny -- neither long wide Razr (although thicker)
 It doesn't Bluetooth, gives little bit comfort
 After all, Bluetooth gains popularity wireless devices, greater likelihood bad people find exploit vulnerabilities said devices
 If don't believe me, perform Google search "bluetooth exploit," "bluejacking," "bluesnarfing
" But I digress
 Call clarity great, signal reception better cell phone I've ever used, it's sexy
My complaint phone menu items phone link Nokia's "MEdia Mall," online store shop new ringtones, themes, etc
 Unfortunately, I haven't found way delete links
 If aren't careful, could find increasing phone bill $
10 every time activate wrong menu item
 I would've given phone 4 stars this, overall average user rating low
 

I got phone 5 days ago Cingular
 I hasitated finally decided return exchange phone
The main problem earpiece small cannot hear party's voice clearly, unless put hole right ear, difficult locate
 Each time, I try several times I place correctly
 I think things good phone
I Nokia phone previously good experince
 But phone designed stupidly?
 The earpiece small thing, also biggest one phone
 

Major improvement Sprint phone
 Lots features I'm still figuring out
 Nice size
 This 3rd cell phone I've ever owned I'm expert, worked well
 Some reception problems, hard complain works least 2x places last phone
 

I read reviews buying phone
 When I got I pleasantly surprised
 I NO volume issues
 In fact, ringer loud rings I teaching class, students beg answer phone
 I also get reception school building phone, I never able before
 As bluetooth capability, I've never used infrared feature before
On good note




 I able video tape daughter skating, showed friends
 It incredible
 I've enjoyed phone glad it
One bad thing though can't choose different ring tone caller
 But group callers assign different ringtone group
Again, great phone cost
 

This GREAT phone EXCEPT power connector
 The pin inside phone small fragile accidentally really easily bent broken off
 This cost $115 Nokia classified problem "Physical damage" warranty cover physical damage
 This ridiculous
 It obvious design problem
 

Pros:Great battery lifeSound quality consistencyLayout good - placement menus, etc - easy manueverCons:Cheap plastic casingVery basic camera - e
g
 zoomEvan Glueck 

used different phone transfered sim cards grandma's phone cuz phone complicated
 I tried phone actually quite happy
 The FM radio cyrstal clear (not car) usually camera OK
One thing I complain though, memory SMALL



 like 3 mega bytes I think





 I bought usb cable pc phone wrong verion I return it
 If buy cable phone please check version like ALL usb cables nokia look alike
I VERY impressed softwere I got nokia website
 Its free program lets transfer EVERYTHING pc phone
 You wirelessly cable (which im trying do) aware phone mp3 player
 The message record sorta suks way, set message ring tone make sure isnt bunch scratchy gatars
Yes I would recomend phone someone isnt REALLY multimedia OK multimedia nevertheless 

There dozens reasons buy cell phone

Recently got first flip phone, Nokia 6102
 Having Nokia user (and FAN) since 2000 I first signed Cingular, I definitely high hopes expectations 6102
 I reason disappointed since Nokia brand served well
 I loved candy-bar style 5190 much, I even got second upgrade phone Cingular model 2002 Nokia discontinued it
 To date, I hear Nokia's biggest seller still 5190
So imagine disappointment surprise I finally plugged 6102 play
 First foremost, reception average best
 I know comments draw ire users raved 6102's reception
 80% time, I move earpiece reposition ear several times course conversation
 The old 5190 NEVER problem
 Again, I hope problem due sample defect
 Even that, one rarely hears quality control issues Nokia
 It supposed second NONE cell phone industry
 Also, battery life isn't great
 I recharge phone every 3 days I don't even use phone much, maybe 1 hour ++ day
This underwhelming performance 6102 comes shock
 I since returned phone back Cingular's eStore replacement
 I declined replacement model
 While I ponder next selection, perhaps Motorola V557 good alternate choice, though I shocked hear Cingular reps V-557 actually PALES comparison Nokia 6102
 But reviews Amazon V-557 VG, reviews 6102
Already I miss Nokia 5190




perhaps I never give Motorola V-557 fails perform well
 

This great phone
 It lot cool features
 If love listen hte radio perfect you
 This phone fm radio
 

I owned phone 2 months exterior LCD cracked
 I drop simply placed pocket sat couch
 It durable Cingular refused replace it
Pros: battery life, MP3 ringtonesCons: The phone durable, cannot configure display date outer LCD, games come terrible
 

Have phone 4 days going return it, despite fact it's attractive phone good form factor
 Main reasons returning (1) poor audio volume even set max; (2) menus intuitive; (3) display info vanishingly small fonts icons, (4) I don't like "flat" phone book entries [that is, name one number associated it
 In contrast, former mobile phone (Sanyo) could store multiple numbers (work, home, mobile, 


) one name]
 Sorry change phones, since I like Nokia, generally
 

I've gone 5 phones less year
 The first one echos bad didn't even recognize voice tags people said I sounded like I talking water
 The 2nd one plain died one day wouldn't even take charge turn on
 The 3rd one drained battery full charge almost nothing couple days without even using turned on
 The 4th one I got yesterday worked day turns none buttons work I can't even access address book
 Cingular finally offered different brand, I checked Amazon's site hoping get one good review
 Now I negotiate get matching accessories




Steer away Nokia 6102




 

I got phone back January
 I must admit, I like phone, I've already bought replacement
 The sound quality phone clear


 ear piece volume kind low I find using speakerphone time
 Has infared, really nice laptop infared also (I've made TONS mp3 ringtones, saved pictures PC)
 I first one replaced March side buttons (the volume camera) would longer work
 The camera's okay (it's phone) - video quality horrid
 No Bluetooth, girls friends 'dubbed' hassle, many times want Bluetooth sound clips pictures Razrs
 It doesn't much memory capacity (only 3 MB), can't save much
 That's ultimately I bought Motorola MPX 220 replace it
 Many people I know bought phone taken back, delcare ones still WILD problems
 It also doesn't pick signal good mom's Motorola V551
 

I used phone week, I'm returning it
Pros:1
 Cool-looking phone - black, red chrome
2
 Color screen good
3
 Very compact
Cons:1
 Audio volume low, even set highest setting
 Conversations often hard hear car windows stereo off
2
 Lack side keys settings makes even basic changes - ring volume, call volume, etc
 - difficult
I grant it's quality phone phone well-made defects
 It would great entry level phone average person doesn't change settings - average hearing
 

I hard please comes cell phones, long camera rings I talk people do
 My old Kyocera model better this
 (This basketball hit two three times
) The phone strange reason shorts me
 It goes randomly doesn't come back happened three times year
 The first time happened worst moment possible: A snowstorm 2 AM ideal setting phone short out
 The sencond time happend randomly third time thing
I bit surprised Nokia good making phones disappointment
 I plan getting new phone soon probably different model likely
 All I say choose phone aware, crazy things
 

I big fan nokia previous mobiles nokia

But one big disappointment

I surprise find bug s/w
If change profile Normal Silent backagain Normal, incoming phones consistent ringtones
 Sometimes ring sometimes wont, light flashed
Currently I removed battery restarted working fine
 But dont know long work
I think Moto Razr much better phone price range
 

I bought phone amazon worth price
 It nice features I wanted cingular coverage also pretty good area
 Overall I would give 5 stars
 

I recieved Nokia 6101 (which essentially hardware 6102) cell phone t-mobile 2 days ago early impressions phone:Pros:- The great reception nokia phones: My appt recieve great coverage t-mobile phones work ones Nokia
 I used 6610 6230 problems reception 6101
- IRDA sync data: I IBM laptop IRDA build in
 So convinent use Nokia PC Suite sync phone outlook
- Supports Mp3 ringtonesCons:- No Bluetooth: Unlike 6230 6101/6102 bluetooth
- Limited memory: I understand Nokia include external memory card slot, music player compatibility phone
 If play Mp3 ringtones surely play mp3s, would great add 512 MB card play music go
- Size Weight: The phone bit bulky heavier flip phones much becomes uncomfortable carry around- Different charger: For reason Nokia different charger phone
 So chargers older models Nokia compatible
Overall I think nice cell business use
 For entertainment such, I think 6230 still Nokia leader
 

This coming person actually done lot research phones, upgrading Nokia 3595
 Some people raving Razr V3, honestly isn't good phone
 The sound quality isn't great, phone although skinny, wide, camera lack luster
 The keys bland, hard use looking, exception Bluetooth 2nd LCD screen, doesn't really whole lot
I consider phone great rival
 This phone Razr great competition Cingular customers great deals going 2-year agreement customers
 I actually got mine roughtly 90 dollars I upgraded I previously mentioned
 I could gotten Razr, phone much practical
This phone plenty features:It video captureCamera feature (which pretty clear hold phone steadyA bright vivid LCD screen (2 actually)A sleek designGreat sized keysEasy navigationOverall simplisticThis Nokia's first successful flip phone, didn't anything outrageous
 It MP3 playback ringtones, full color graphics available moving screen savers
 Sound quality excellent, phone feels durable
 Its great size, feels good hand
 Not charges quickly, fair battery life
 I'm sure 6102s, mine came NO dead pixels either screen, that's great thing worry about
 Although isn't important lot people, me


 phone DOES get face grease easily


 nice


 friend one LG flip phone use 10 seconds screen covered face grease
With everything however, phone gadgets may want
 It doesn't Bluetooth, can't lame like everyone else get one earsets, least "cool" ones
 The cases aren't exciting
 There expansion slot, ISN'T SmartPhone, can't lot PDA functions
 The sound quality ringtones aren't great, lot choose from
 Its call justify spending $2
49 one
 I personally The Outsider A Perfect Circle, pretty decent quality
 Unlike Razr, isn't meant hearing aids, honestly, feature isn't great phone, newer Razr phones coming better utilize feature I believe, great deal money
This phone recognize Sim Card VERY quickly, I pleasantly surprised
 Not much configuration involved
 I didn't even set time date
 The phone didn't set numbers single name folders like last phone, default put number next it: i
e
 Corey 2 numbers


 I Corey Corey1
 Not necessarily bad thing, something I noticed
 The interface really nicely set up, way access camera click button right side
 The volume rocker left side, simple use, ringtone get LOAD, might want make lower setting, unless hearing impaired
 Sim Card enclosure doesn't seem durable, I nervous I need take breifly


 also pretty difficult open
BOTTOM LINE: This durable, easy, phone use anyone, definately last next phone generation arised
 At great price, great deals, ideal phone suit NEEDS, even though doesn't supply WANTS
 This stylish phone great addition Nokia line, well flip-phone craze
 In opinion balanced phone Razr V3, like everything, depends are, use for

I Cingular customer 18 months so, switching Sprint
 I long wanted switch away Cingular due poor reception frequently dropped calls original phone
 The phone Samsung entry-level model, zero cost 1-year plan
 I spoke friends area swore Cingular experience better mine
 They expensive phones
 After research, I decided give Cingular second chance buying Nokia 6102 pocket (rather getting upgrade "deal" 2 year contract extension
)It good decision
 This phone turned happy Cingular customer, part
 The reception much stronger
 My old phone would give 0 bars house, one gives 1-3 bars holds calls even inside house
 It still drops calls low spots I drive through, I figure that's unavoidable
The camera cute toy
 It takes blurry pictures poor lighting, decent shots good light
 I got USB download cable retrieve photos
 I yet get Cingular's multimedia messaging work email pics account
 (I suspect that's Cingular problem, phone problem)
The wireless web browser nice, it's real convenient way upload pics sounds phone
 The data cable also works well that, free (from Nokia website) software cable includes tools help construct images sound clips
Managing address book took work
 I numbers stored card old phone
 The new phone didn't read card quite way: kept numbers, lost flags told number home, work cell person
 Eventually I moved numbers Windows Address book use cable software sync two
 That works beautifully
Bottom line: The phone great
 Cingular still quirks I live with
 Toy camera fun
 Data cable highly recommended accessory
Followup Nov 29, 2005:Still love phone
 I've noticed problems pushing buttons accident it's closed
My USB cable *not* one Nokia sells $50
 It's asian unbranded cable I paid around $15 for
 Use Google find one
 Had bit fun getting drivers straight first, otherwise works like charm
 Also, I think IrDA function supposed work Nokia software well, IrDA laptop similar device
Finally, website somewhere put files download, it's pretty easy load images ringtone sound files phone using wireless web browser
 Just upload website download via phone browser
 All pay airtime download
 

I replaced sony ericson Nokia 6102 flip phone, I found following differences:Nokia has:1
 Better sound quality2
 Better reception3
 Great speakerphone: clear loud though sometimes echoes side, depending location
4
 Camera nice quality grainy flash/evening mode great all
 Pictures come real dark clear
5
 Less talk time (4 hours) I charge battery every evening, 2 hours talking, average daily use, battery real low
 Compared ericson, I charged week, real setback
6
 Battery also seems take longer charge
 My ericson 15 mins 2 4 bars up
 Nokia takes 30-45 mins 2 bars
7
 It hard find nicely fitting case flip phones
 If like swivel belt clip pouch case, like it, prefer sleeve-case find difficult find something suitable reasonable price
8
 It's bluetooth, won't able use wireless gadgets, I find speakerphone sufficient hands-free-conversations
 The problem hands-free option receive call, flip open phone push button hands-free talk
 If placing call, wait till party picks - use hands-free button
9
 Recently I discovered voice-call option
 Pushing button left activates voice tag receptor
 If saved someone's number address book assigned voice (such "Home"), saying "home" voice receptor dial number
 Very nice second hand full groceries
 But number voice tags limited
 I think 10 maximum
In overall, I gave 4 stars comparatively weak battery, terms serving basic phone functions works well
 

This far coolest best cell phone I ever owned
 The reception great everywhere, even home reception generally poor
 The camera video features superb, extremely well image quality, one thing lacks bluetooth capapbilties
 I used motorola v220 horrible phone, also sony erricson z500 older nokia cingular, tops all
 kudos nokia, job well done 

What look cell phone? Is battery life, features, design, call quality? Well, let tell you, find Nokia 6102
I many phones throughout 2
5 years Cingular Customer
 Many caught eye, none like one has
The design phone amazing
 It second flip-style Nokia phone I've owned
 The flip sturdy, phone feel plasticy all
 The spring phone feels much better Motorola Samsung flip phone I've ever had
 The buttons nice size, good thing many people
 The color, grey black awesome color scheme
All Nokia phones basics, text messaging, picture messaging, wireless internet access, etc
 This phone takes step class 6 EDGE, FM radio capability, dual displays
 The menus also much easier use phones, Nokias
The battery life phone amazing


 I've made many calls receiving phone days ago, battery strength indicator gone all
 That's pretty amazing
 The battery also charges quickly
 A newly designed Nokia charger used device
 It's unique, alot smaller Nokia chargers
Nokia phones always known excellent call quality, ability keep calls low-signal areas
 This Nokia phone different
 There traditional GSM hiss noise phone, crystal-clear calls stay connected long time even low-signal areas
My overall opinion phone trustworthy phone, won't let down, especially need most
 It excellent battery life, call quality, features ever need
 I many phones past, I would recommend phone others
 

A recent move forced change service providers new home (in major metropolitan area) dead spot
 "Can hear me?' No, I can't
 So I took advantage Cingular's 30 day return policy hoping I could make call lose signal
 After week I honestly say phone lives beyond expectations
 I great reception, dropped calls pleased purchase
To me, slickest thing phone infrared port
 One less cable keep track of
 I beamed Outlook address book PDA phone seconds
Although I didn't need camera, nice addition
 In fact, capable taking photo low light without flash
 The documentation it's' use poor, I would advise play camera options key get use it
A lot reviewers complained low volume, I I repositioned phone lower ear
 My natural tendency hold phone almost lips caused small speaker opening ear
 Try it, I bet notice marked increase volume also
I used radio yet contrary one review here, mini headphone jack big jack phone
 I guess disappointment I live it
After reading many website reviews I think negative reviews people tale time READ THE OWNERS MANUAL
 Now I admit documentation overwhelming, trying find use specific feature time consuming, here's tip
 Download PDF owners manual file, (a link page) use Adobe's search function find answer questions
Well, thanks letting share opinions I hope help decision
 

I wanted quickly clarify respond something another reviewer said
 It fact possible assign individual ring tones people
 You create group add person group
 Once assign ring tone "group
" Yeah, it's simple last phone, Motorola, it's still pretty quick easy
Additionally, fact use photo took ago attach contact
 Click entry phone book, Click Options -> Add Detail -> Image, search saved images
 Again, little time consuming, I 10 seconds
 In grand scheme phone's features, I wouldn't let things deter purchasing phone
I issue accidentally pressing buttons phone closed
 It's puzzler annoyance time doesn't seem drain battery quicker cause problems besides fact I click feature
Overall I love phone, would highly recommend it
 I actually like phone display ear piece larger phones, I find user-friendly, personally
 I bought phone use phone, I satisfied performance
 

I got first Nokia 6102 October 2005
 I got second Nokia 6102 March 2006
 It April 2006 I'm looking replacement
 Here's story goes:When I first got model, I really liked lot
 I complaints whatsoever except later wished Bluetooth capabilities
 That biggy since I'm one carry around cell phone every I go
 It stays car I'm home usually stays desk work
 If I'm office minutes, I'll bring along me
 Cell phones nice have, but




 I'm getting track story
Like I said, I really liked phone
 Occasionally, I'll use Yahoo Instant Messenger work communicate couple others meetings
 For five months, daily routine using phone worked flawless
 The suddenly one day, reset I attempting access Messenger
 I lost settings "G" vanished main screen
 Normally, I used Messenger, would time-out minutes phone would switch back main screen
 I would get pop-up message received, I could go back Messenger connected
After reset occurred, Messenger times-out goes back main screen, connection lost
 After error, I attempt connect Messenger Internet, asks I want allow network access
Anyhow, going three layers Cingular support, first decided nothing could gave impression wanted end conversation
 I eventually get little ugly telling problem problem; either phone gave me, network, I want fixed
 They sent new phone overnight
The new phone worked flawless almost two weeks
 One day, I Messenger decided I needed exit place ringer silent, I did
 When I attempted call Messenger (it runs background), I get Java error error codes
 Then phone resets itself
 Lo behold, I back problems I first phone
As I'm writing this, I email Nokia looking suggestion
 I like phone I don't see current Cingular compatible models I think I would like better
 If Nokia doesn't clue, I'll call Cingular another replacement, I may go different make model
For happen twice, I'm beginning think may software bug
 Anyhow, don't plan using Yahoo Messenger application comes phone, satisfied phone
 

I vey particular consumer
 I tons reseach item I purchase it, I compare items
 I read website reviews everything
 I rather hesitant ordering phone reading many negative reviews
 But,I took chance ordered way (I got really good price) plesantly surprised find actually really good phone
I found bit difficult navigate menu begin use it, able find need pretty quickly
 I thought picture quality good
 (I mean you're probably going take professional headshots phone camera so


)I pleased quality video
 The sound fine, reception
 I plesantly surprised quality phone itself
 It sturdy, strong flip
 though several parts plastic feel light flimsy many reviews stated
 I would suggest ordering case, shiny black outershell seems like may scratch easily
 This phone lot features including FM radio, headphones needed listen radio included
 (Another service provider sells model includes headset phone


tsk,tsk Cingular)however, I found inexpensive earbud work well
(I purchased one dollar store)All I think phone good choice someone looking purchase multi function phone without frills unneeded extras
 




Got charger 99 cents I shouldn't surprised
 When I plug phone eventually shuts I pull battery put back turn phone again
 Plus, didn't even charge battery like supposed to
 The plus price


 =( 

Great value
 It works fine
 And shipping charges Canada reasonable (BargainCell Canadian orders well-timely packaged well)
 Very happy item
 

I nearly bought Tmobile site $24
99
 Even postage shipping, I saved lot - yes works fine
 

Works great Nokia 5300
 Hard find locally, adaptor right connections stereo sound regular headphones
 













































































































































































































































































































































































I bought October 2006 3 months later - December 2006 two items stopped working
 The car charger longer charges phone hands free ear piece also suddenly stopped working
 The case still "works" stays phone, nothing break that
 Very unsatisfied
 

I ordered items I needed phone charger
 The cover works fine, earpiece works o
k
 (the connector connect easily one came phone)
 The charger quit working second time I used it
 You get pay for
 

The case charger great headset cheap
 Its quality poor barely fit phone
 Hopefully mine I somehow doubt it
 

I purchased item "value"
 I understand great deal - ear piece right piece phones, I unable use it, car charger stop working within month
 I would recommend purchasing item
 

The case fits Nokia 6103 perfectly, neat bulky
 The car charger works well
 I never used headset
 This great buy
 I loved 

This combo set exactly 3 accessories I needed new phone
 I excited find packaged together, and, great price
 Well, sometimes get pay for


The case fits pretty well far seems durable, however car charger especially ear bud hard attach phone ( almost impossible driving) seem bulky ill designed
 If need earbud charger rare occassions might suit well
 However use everyday, I would look elsewhere 

I totally happy purchase
 For price charger car, I got head set case too
 

Headset works fine listening radio callers get much buzzing
 Charger died 4 days
 Case OK I don't use it
 Will probably attempt return this
Indeed get pay for--if you're lucky got kit made good day
 

This earphone doesnt work
 You hear anything this
 

I bought primarily cover hands free



But hands free poor quality 


the car charger worked stopped working


Over 10 bucks okay


 

I (well, them, actually) 3 days
I carefully read previous reviews still took shot
 I mumbled worst case I lost 10 bucks
It turns fairly good pieces assessories
+ case - haven't used yet intend use all
+ car charge - good, complaint far, smelling, smoking, important, charge+ headset - soso good, hard plug first time, needs little force again, it's hard unplug
 Actually I haven't unpluged yet 'cuz I afraid broken :)Overall, meets expectation
 

All 3 items worked Nokia 6103
 The quality well worth price
 

I like leather phone cover - takes getting used to, hits antenna open phone
 The car charger I got works fine, I sent wrong ear bud
 I supposed get one Nokia 6102, included one NK 7210
 I able return it, hassle
 Just check shipment carefully
 

The car charger work case poor quality leather, get pay for
 After paying total $12
00ish item, I still go purchase car charger works
 For $12
00 worth time money return goods
 I would like give product zero stars
 

For price, I say I'm basically happy purchase, since item I REALLY looking purchase car charger, works fine
 I kept case, too, tight fit phone, protects well
 I threw hands-free almost immediately, reviewers reported doesn't fit phone - they're right statement
 It's basically worthless component included kit
 I went Cingular kiosk local mall purchased FANTASTIC hands-free phone
 

I bought headset case really
 case works well first thought headset wasn't phone look headset, inputs look same
 little silver things push line input phone silver things push
 overall it's good price
 

This product reasonably priced, however ear bud broke first use
 I use tweezers get piece plastic jack
 The leather cover rather gaudy glue visable plastic display cover
 At least car charger works, I bought first place, ear bud broke I able listen radio phone, cool



 

Received three piece set bag said could NOT returned bag opened
 How supposed see works/fits don't take items test them?
 Duh
 Car charger doesn't fit there's way return it
 Take advice save money; go store spend little money get something works
 

The earbud headset Nokia phone causes buzzing sound person I call hear
 I hear noise all
 The person cell phone landline phone I get complaint
 The sound bees buzzing ear
 The earbud came phone would cut periodically without warning
 I've given getting earbud headset phone
 

The handsfree set useless due inferior voice quality
 We bought 3 car chargers three stopped working time
 I ended buying adaptor using old phone's charger
 The leather cover good durable
 So, tip buy leather cover two products pieces worthless junk
 

I pleased purchase Nokia combo pack, price couldn't beat value--the cover fits nicely, charger works great, headset could better--all good purchase price
 Service great
 

nokia 6102 took beating school year hoped 3 pack would help save money make traveling school home easier
 nope
the case pretty good
 kept scratches phone
 car charger doesn't work
 tested 2 different cars
 head set jack doesn't even fit phone


 dispointing
case good pieces much
 

cannot even plug head set phone
 seems different size
 

The ear piece fit phone advertised
 Wasn't worth returning since shipping would cost product
 

I sad say I return car charger work
 I awaiting new one
 

The charger stopped charging month
 The audio quality ear piece poor
 

This second time I ordered combo package
 The first time shipment complete everthing worked, can't beat price
This second time I ordered combo, wrong AC charger sent plug big fit phone, rendering charger useless me
 It seems like big hassel costly ship item back ask replace one item
 

headphone doesn't even match phone
 thing got benefit charger
 charger broke within month
 piece ****
 don't buy it
 

I bought 2 packs recently
One pack came WITHOUT hands free ear bud
I dont know come got lost
Charger looks good
This first ever complaint onlineshopping
 

The case fit fine I used charger car yet
 I really bought set earpiece, work all
 I threw away
 

All need wall socket
 Charges everthing right up
 

I wanted earpieace I said cover car thingy would cool
 But package ear pieace
 Amazon right I still go buy ear pieace
 

I ordered item three weeks ago still even shipped company last two weeks allow cancelation
 Beware ordering company
 I ordered another item company day received yet either
 Worst service I've seen years
 

After reading horrible reviews I thought I taking gamble getting starter kit
 It turns every piece included greatly exceeded expectations
*Many people said couldn't get case fit phone
 The way could possibly problems trying put top half case first, followed bottom half
 Come people use common sense
*Another complaint case couldn't plug components case on
 I attach headset plug charger fine
 Once comes common sense
 When I first put case I checked openings lining took case used tapered end pencil gently stretch opening little component
 Not exactly rocket science
*As difficulty plugging headset, yes need press hard, I don't feel like I'm going break anything I make sure I'm lining facing correct way I press place
 So I don't understand complaints this
I'm really quite pleased purchase would recommend starter kit others purchasing phone
 Glad I didn't skip due previous negative reviews
 

All 3 accessories work wonderfully phone
 At first I saw headseat, I afraid going plug in, problem
 Also, I hear person end well headset
 The reception clear
 It sounds way better dad's bluetooth
 It's also good want use radio phone, need headset so
 The carrying case steal
 You would able get Cingular store price
 I already bought different type holster Cingular store, cost $19
99, good one comes set
 I haven't tried car charger yet, I've already gotten money's worth
 This smart purchase Nokia 6102 like I do
 

The case came thing working
 I plugged car charger smelling like something burning
 Seems like good deal saying true get pay for
 

I hesitate buy "cheap" items eBay I thought might good deal
 Well I finally got items (after 2 weeks)
The case cheap doesn't completely cover big LCD screen
 The cutout headset doesn't line phone
 Of course kind I expected I wasn't bummed it
The headset I wanted
 It almost impossible get plugged phone
 Once get it, I could hear fine me
 I told callers could hear lot static though
 It answer button cord
 I problems plugging taking out
 I'm really afraid I'm going break something
I've tried car charger yet
 Hopefully work okay
I guess get pay I shouldn't complain much maybe I risked eBay
 

I read reviews item I bought it
 Neither headset cover fit phone
 Trying get something cheap


I guess thats gets me


something cheap
 Buy another kind setup want work you
 

I couldn't fit headset phone port without thinking I would break something
 Like another reviewer said, holes phone case don't line proper spots phone either
 Save money get quality stuff
 

This great deal doubt


but alas, car charger didn't work

 exceptional Amazon customer service, I returned 3 piece combo pack got whole new pack (this time, working charger :-)) within week
I definitely recommend anyone may want buy

 test charger ASAP
 

I really disappointed product
 The earpiece fit phone, I really needed package
 Although car charger work
 I guess case "you get pay for"
 

The leather case fits nicely
 The car charger works fine
 The earbud attachment didn't fit Nokia 6102 phone plugs phone
 Following warranty instructions card, I returned Wireless Technologies letter explanation February 19,2006 haven't heard yet
 Nothing
 

far price goes, can't really get better deal
 however, disappointed car charger (starts charging phone first stops) case doesn't let phone close way
 least hands-free ear piece works fine
 overall guess could spent $10 worse way realize it's probably cheap reason
 

I lot research selecting new phone
 I really wanted go seperate cell phone PDA single device, I didn't really want one clunky (to anyway) Treo-type devices
So time renew phone contract, I ended getting two units, one one wife
 At first, I quite pleased purchase
 It many, many features really everything I looking for
Unfortunately, wife I found phones unreliable
 They would frequently lock up, often times would try something you'd get "Out Memory" error
 The way I could alleviate powering phone
 Sometimes would lock point way recover actually remove battery
On least couple occassions, I tried call wife, tried call me, call went phone, phone ring/vibrate/or anything
 It got point got habit "rebooting" phones beginning day try minimize problems
My wife got fed hers, I bought unlocked Razr
 She's much happier it
 I planned keeping mine, one day started throwing "out memory" error I could longer use phone
 Powering down, removing battery, nothing mattered 


 every time I'd power on, within minutes, phone would stop working every attempted action would result "out memory" error
I could chalk bum unit similar problems phones
 If ever get bugs worked it, would probably nice phone
 Meanwhile, I went ahead bought unlocked Razr, too, doesn't many features, it's much less frustrating day-to-day use
 

For Nokia buy waas letdown me
 I wish features like previous samsung piece


 daily alarm, automatic dialpad locking, etc
 I'm stuck least another year
 :-( 

This cool phone, unfortunately crashes every couple days order get going I remove battery, replace restart it
 I exchanging something better
 So sad
 

got phone week ago
its better pink razor,i love coz MP3,takes good pictures,i really like nokia phone phone
love 

love 

love it




 

I've owned couple MOTOROLA admit cool-looking phones
 They look fashionable, stylish, making feel young
 But


the thing I hate dropped calls lot
 I mean


A LOT
 My calls would disconnected unreasonable I talked phone 10-15mins
 Sometimes even 5 mins
NOKIA, maybe phones look chunky, cool motorola, not-so-stylish kind phones, DO HAVE best quality cell phones
 Not mention battery life, humanize functions, course, keeping stable used
 I'll highly recommend NOKIA anyone looking well made, great quality cell phone
And good Nokia 6682? Well, check lot reviews you'll see
 They've got everything
 

This first Smartphone I know I missing
 You much phone especially Symbian software - Unlimited video recording, Play MP3, Great camera phone Flash boot, Can used GPS unit added GPS receiver & softweare, play MAME games, much much more
 Oh functions well phone ;-) 

After looking reviews Amazon, I decided go phone spite avid fan Samsung
 Problems started right day 1
 Signal inside apartment way less, I would sit one place talking fear call dropping
 Still, phone would inconsiderate would drop one two calls
 My friends Cingular come apartment, get pretty strong signal everywhere


Alright


 move work place
 Wow

 Full strength signal


 I make call, drops well


 And display promptly shows 'No network', 2 minutes shows full strength signal
 Ah
 I forget mention this
 At underground garage, signal whatsoever
 But, reach ground level, hero still sleeping
 He decides time search signal 2-3 minutes
This first time I seen phone freezes/hangs
 I would make call, I would never able terminate it
 At times, would show 'Calling so-and-so' 2-3 minutes, next step call setup never seems happen
I went Cingular store, knowledgeable representative gives engineering solution restarting phone, caveat I take battery phone switched on
 As expected, improvement
 But, this, frequency phone would restart went up
 I doubts phone haunted
This apart, terms plain usability, phone sloppy
 I could find change ring tone without referring manual
 The menu loads soooo slow begin wondering went back stone age
 Pressing green button normally press make call displays outgoing calls made
 But, want see received calls missed calls, go get exercise going three levels menu
I called Warranty Department Cingular arranged get replacement
 The pathetic part I would get product again
Oh God


 1
5 years contract get :-(Go get Samsung D807 happy
Following earlier review I hoping something wrong particular instrument I having


I received yet another Nokia 6682 replacement
 I hoping see 'Nokia' performance one least
 But, turns level genius inbuilt phone
 Basically, want friends call often disturb you, carry phone
 Because, calls never reach you
 Your friends would start complain picking calls, ignoring them, eventually give up

 The best part would even see phone alerting call
 The silent killer

This phone lot jazz super-fast mode operation
 Press button, wait 5 seconds respond
 Incredible 21st century technology, huh? But still, reviewers seem amazing
 They thrilled Adobe reader, voice recorder, browser, etc
 Who cares make call? Try making one, call would drop least twice sure
 And, friend pathetic Samsung D807 next you, would go talking
 Poor guy


 Adobe reader though


 good phone?? Oh

 and, I tell state-of-the-art technology phone shuts phone hangs, power rather power power up
 That energy conservation you
 All last week, Nokia 6682 switched 5 different occasions
Given need high-tech jazz ability make call, could carry laptop nice phone
 or, could carry Nokia 6682 phone


 Nokia would 1MB-RAM laptop
 

I'm pretty disappointed phone
 It's got poor battery life, complicated buggy interface
 It's also large bulky
 Beyond that, thing annoys doesn't seem way lock keypad automatically idle period
 The end result I forget manually lock keypad sits beeping quietly pocket battery runs calls random person address book
Unless want whiz-bang extra features people data plan, I'd suggest sticking simpler phone good battery life basic phone features like keypad lock
 

First solid phone good reception
 Especially like capablity remap 7 programable buttons re-orgnized icons/folders totally change Cingular's default setting always try bring value-add services
 

Just got phone last week already started liking it
 Excellent reception
 You fall love look
 MP3 player well designed sound quality GREAT
 Sharp display
This MUST phone steal price 

This good cell phone Amazon
com gives best deal
 But, can't transfer old phone number different provider Cingular Amazon
com
 If transfer old phone number, won't get mail-in rebate
 Please read amazon
com mail-in rebate rules carefully


You read transfer number link : http://www
amazon
com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/508597/102-6686881-6992121 

I've phone 12 hours I love far
 I bought Razr days ago recption good Nokia 6682 Razr sound quality horrible
 The Nokia sound quality good even one bar reception usually
 I'm area hit hurrican Katrina network still bad Cingular
I've barely scratched surface features I love far
 The --INCLUDED-- Nokia software AND USB cable made entering contacts painless
 I entered 40 maybe 15 minutes
 Motorola include software OR data cable
The menus take getting used seem fine
 overall
 I'm really looking forward exploring software Symbian operating system
 I'm using internet right desktop getting file download speeds 12KB/sec times, 100k so
 I couldn't even get web page pull Razr
 You also view full web pages phone, although bit hard read formated phones
The camera MILES better Razr
 The quality good cheap digital camera
 The sliding lens cover great too
 Phone also comes screen protector already I almost didn't even notice
 I'm going see I buy more
The biggest problem I've found far buttons small bit hard press thumb, bad practice
MP3 player phone really nice too
 They even include headphones, good since Nokia headphones
 No standard headphone jack, sorry
 The 64mb media card respectable upgraded 1gb
 *** If want smartphone Bluetooth MUST consider one
**Day 3 Update: The battery life advertised
 MP3 playback great though I wish I could use sony headphones
 Music also play speakerphone quality lacking way
 Gotta get bigger flash card too
 64mb card holds 9 songs encoded lame codec (about 180kbps)
 Menus bit clunky it's understandable tremendous amount functions, get lost
 (took forever realize click song start playing) Works great bluetooth headset
**Day 20 Update: Think I change rating 4 stars
 Still like phone I'm stability problems
 It tends lock I make menu changes, requiring power off/on
 The voice dialing seems suck too
 I'm thinking sending mine replacement
 I've using basic voice dialing instead premium version 7 day trial
 I'd happy functionality would recognize names I say them
 

Being diehard Nokia fan, I made mind buy third nokia
 Esp incident:My earlier nokia 6610 spent 45 minutes pool, I realized presence pocket
 Well, I dried sunlight hair-dryer, cleaned copper connectors (to remove oxidation products) after-shave works w/o problem
 Kudos Nokia



Coming back 6682, I phone 5 days explored features now
 Here views:Looks: Impressive smooth

 You would certainly love show kool phone others :)Basic Features: Signal strength, battery life- really goodDisplay - Awesomely brilliant
 Includes LED detect surrounding light adjust display
Speakerphone - Very good, Mic catch voice across room
Menu - Easy explore
 Might take day two get used to
Kool Features:Camera - 1

 (thats sure +)Editing: Photo n video editing



wowSpeakerphone - Excellent volume n quality play mp3s n videos mp4, rm

 Can edit buy authorization code QuickOffice software online $15
OS: Sometimes goes slow depending applications running
 Otherwise Ok general use
Internet: Good quality (I m using basic one )Recorder: Excellent audio recorder voice commands
 Dont know video recording capability nowConnectivity: Bluetooth - standardCable - With included USB cable connects PC simply copy-paste documents, images, songs etc
Memory - RS MMC, (1 GB card abt $30 amazon

pretty ok)COST- IT IS FREE (r u kidding me

???)Thoughts: If really really used small phone, might feel big initially
I cant comment internet download speed etc I high speed data plan
 Normal Media/Browser runs OK
Update 10 weeks: 1
 Pictures flash low light place like restaurant might come bit grainy
2
 RS-MMC memory hard find except Amazon, occassionally
3
 You cannot assign tones different callers
Update 7 months:1
 You assign separate tones callers alongwith pictures
2
 You record video sound
3
 Once Synched Outlook (even w/o data plan), phone great keep emails calendar updated
 

I'm long-time Nokia user, I'll continue buy Nokia
 This fifth Nokia 2160, 6160, 3360, 7210
1
 The phones initial release Cingular buggy
 I understand due incompatibility Cingular's SIM
 Problems I discovered due problem include power button powering phone brief tap
 Nokia says hold power button three seconds phone powers off
 If hold phone thumb side (on power button), it's easy power phone you're middle conversation
2
 The slide cover camera nice, flash
 The pictures large (file) size grainy
 Pictures averaged 400kb, I've seen much better pictures friends' Trios
 I'd still rather 6682
3
 The case phone PLASTIC slippery hold onto sweaty hands
 I've dropped phone times, plastic case held ok, easily scratched (not cracked, though)
 A rubbery grip cover would help area (see eBay)
4
 The Symbian OS MUCH better standard Java Crap OS Nokia makes many phones (including previous 7210)
 Switching menus much faster, phone still hangs every again
 My phone frozen hours I realized I wasn't receiving calls
 A simple power-down/reset required return phone normal functionality
 It IS bit frustrating need use phone you're driving, though
5
 This phone IS MAC COMPATIBLE


 Yes, software suite PC, much Mac
 iSync recognizes phone via Bluetooth connection
 You sync calendar (iCal) contacts (Address Book) data
 Also, Salling Clicker (google it) INCREDIBLE application allows remotely control Mac using 6682 via Bluetooth
 Ignore guy says phone isn't Mac compatible (and returned phone)
 He returned phone actually checked HOW make work Mac
 Sorry him
6
 If don't already card reader, GET one transfer data large RS-MMC phone
 I currently 1 Gig card, I transfer AAC files time temporary iPod
 MP3 files better, use ID3 tags see artist information song details
 Sound included stereo headset GREAT
 You even play music Bluetooth headset
 Beware: When start fill large card 1 Gig card, menus slow quite considerably
 For example, I 500 MB songs, slows menu select ring tones
 You may think phone locked up, it's VERY slow
 Be patient
In all, GREAT phone
 If CAN wait, hold Nokia N80
 The N80 updated OS, larger screen size, better camera (even though cover), on-board memory (64MB - 6682 includes 8MB, including RS-MMC)
If want phone portable computer, check 6682 out
 If hold (and want pay money initial release), wait N80
 

In past month I've used 4 different phones Cingular
 (RAZR, SLVR, LGCU500, 6682) At first glance I didn't want phone, big little bulky I went phones smaller sleek
 To stay topic 6682 forth phone within 30 day trial plan
 The rep kept trying get use phone along
 Every complaint I others, phone could handle
 Looking back I'm happy I made switch


First let address concerns others posted
 You put phone airplane mode, Mac compatible, don't go 500 menus get text messaging (The 4 Way 2 navagation buttons customized ANY program), don't like use Nokia's headphones, use dongle converter
Reception - top notch
 I hear people headset driving windows down
Bluetooth - Devices connect fine, I connect internet laptop using bluetooth dongle
Apps - It's Symbian OS phone - tons apps customize phone way want
Camera - 1
3MP camera rich optionsMP3 Player - Comes Realplayer listen MP3s working programs
Overall - Sure I would liked little slimmer, phone makes size
 Besides I see RAZRs place used now, kinda defeats purpose phone stick out
 My friend got one, "Flip-Phone"
 I'm glad I didn't choose book cover
 

Pretty good phone
 Potential buyers warned phone much larger regular clam-shell phones
 It even larger razor
 Here pros cons
Pros:- Nokia considerate cell phone manufacture
 (either I'm used low standards?) The phone comes packaged 64mb miniSD card play around phone
 It comes stereo headset attaches phone listen music
 On top that, comes link cable hook phone computer
 Compared motorola (specifically, razr slvr) package phone link cable, nokia great job giving consumer everything need right box
 The samsung d807, way, come anything besides phone either (namely, comes without headsets datalink)
 The link software also included motorola razr requires buy link software never made sense me
- camera amazingly good
 The quality good it's got best zoom camera phones I've ever seen
- easy download install apps
- phone looks pretty cool
 Especially outside night
 It hard describe words backlight seems tastefull manufactures
- The sound quality GREAT
 I've razr 6 month I reget buying phone everyday utterly attrocious sound quality
 The nokia 6682 also gets much better reception motorola
 As side note, nokia gets better reception samsung d807 well
- video seems pretty good
Cons:- phone pretty heavy
 It larger phones now-a-days
 (I'm including organizer-phones like blackberry equivalent keyboard-type phones although nokia pretty good job powerful 3g phone)
 If cute small thing, DON'T GET THIS PHONE
 Try samsung d807 excellent sound quality performance
 I would recommend motorola razr reason poor sound quality described above
- battery life good
 I got 2 1/2 days life thing recharge
 (keep mind I lot heavy calling playing-around etc
)- design seems little clunky
 (I kind like others may find boxy something I put con section)- phone lag bit heavy usage although I've never experienced "lock-up" others refering to
Conclusion:All all, pretty good phone
 My personal rating 4
4 size, weight battery life
 This phone best camera capability phones US
 (excluding over-priced helio phones course)
 I would recommend phone people like taking pictures lot maybe video "kodak-moments"
 Bloggers probably get kick phone
 If want smaller slicker phone good camera video, go samsung d807
 

I've phone week pretty impressed it's features
 Nokia makes solid phone 6682 definitly top list
 It's great price great phone people wait Nokia N91 due next year
Pros:1
 Size, screen keys
 I 3650 before, phone inch shorter bit thinner
 That said it's still bigger phones today
 The keys solid great feel slightly "tilted" felt easily
 The screen amazing
 Very bright smart boot
 It light sensor adjusts screen key lighting best viewed surroundings (great extending battery life well)
2
 I always liked 'poor' quality pictures 3650
 They nice 'polariod' feel them
 This phone great camera
 1
3 megapixels may bit much phone, i'm sure folks wondering got along without while
 The camera also flash, find isn't useful past feet (but hey, it's nice feature phone)
 Lastly, camera 6x digital zoom works well something lacking picture phones now
 bravo
3
 Software
 The apps installed phone definitly set smart phone
 You view edit (edit fee) office documents pdf files (same software treo 650)
 There also several apps might make people's lives easier, I find solid Series 60 Symbian software me
 The OS solid provides lots usable features like Contact management allows several numbers assigned person (motorola doesn't this)
4
 PIM software great
 A new 'today' screen added called 'active standby' shows meetings, todos messages received
5
 The speakerphone noise cancelling microphones excellent
 I use phone places people hear loud clear
6
 Removable media slot
 Finally
 The OS even shuts apps use card don't loose information
 Brilliant
Cons:1
 RC-MMC card
 I'm sure chosen space limitations, would nice buy new storage cards phone
 Also, i've read several reports bad conflicts upgrading card larger size
 It comes 64Mb, really want 512Mb phone
2
 Headphone jack
 There isn't one
 You use supplied headphones Nokia
 They good headphones, mini-jack prevents users enjoying MP3 capabilities favorite headphones
3
 This phone trumps Motorola ROKR ways except doesn't resume music hang call (it stops phone rings though)
 Hopefully Nokia fixes future software release
4
 Should simple USB connection 

I purchased phone around 1st July 2006
 After three weeks use I definitely say great deal
 No money phone 550 minutes Cingular 60 bucks 2 years sounds pretty reasonable me
The sound quality phone great
The sync software comes phone data cable worked flawlessly
 I use outlook sync weekly basis
The camera good must shots - even bit lacking quality
I played recorder probably could useful
The phone screen first rate phone construction quality - exception thin plastic cover camera lens
The downside MMC dual voltage memory card 64 meg hard find replacement card best buy, office depot, etc


I read posts phone rebooted I yet experience - thankfully
I highly recommend phone
My wife got pink Motorola Razor phone free okay - near quality phone
 

I noticed reviewers ordering 1GB memory cards
 At time review, 1GB memory cards available
 This phone uses DVRSMMC (DUAL VOLTAGE REDUCED SIZE MULTIMEDIA CARDS, aka MMCmobile) memory, RSMMC that's sold Amazon
 RSMMC work phone
This incredible phone Amazon offers great price it
3rd party support well established plenty programs games purchase free
The camera suffers indoor lighting, excellent natural light
 Pictures dark flash turn well
 

I got Nokia 6681 (the rest-of-the-world counterpart 6682) gift
 It purchased India shipped via fedex
 However, I liked phone much I wanted share thoughts
This phone really talks of
 I using T-mobile service complains far
 usual stuff expect phone works exactly expected
 e
g
 voice quality good, handsfree alright, address book better phones
 What takes phone new heights this:1
 Awesome email features
 I hooked phone POP3 email personal website phone checks email every 30 minutes
 I almost complains sending receiving emails attachments etc
 I use mobile blog textamerica dot com
2
 Good web browser
 The default web browser good job
 However, Opera browser found extra killer app
 I miss features desktop type browser opera - except ability play avi videos, flash websites, quicktime videos etc
 (This phone's problem though
 It quicktime perhaps mobile phone plugin playing videos yet
 This phone far ahead time)
 Opera ovely keyboard shortcuts using features
3
 When I thought using phone internet email, felt resistance inside use phone keyboard I felt buying bluetooth keyboard aboslute must
 However, using phone days, I really issue using phone keys
 They dont even "feel" like fall apart extensive usage - strong "feel" phone keys
4
 User interface
 The makers phone really must talked people like long time making phone
 I issues understanding error messages menu options information messages phone
 The user interface even "guesses" user wants various buttons
 For example, I open mailbox dont anything like second two, phone asks want connect internet download emails - press "yes" get need
 If not, would probably press right sequence buttons download email
 An easy phone
5
 Camera good
 I took snaps friends - expressed surprise (seperately) image quality
 video also good
6
 Memory card
 Nice
 however, default 64 MB memory card good enough going listen music this
 I ordered 1 gig card amazon
7
 MP3 player good ipod devices - except desktop software like itunes
 The speaker phone produce loud enough music nokia earphones good
 I intend hook windows media player soon - dont know though
8
 The thing trouble fact phone 8 megs board ram
 For reason, phone already chewed 3 4 megs stuff clue about
 I need figure one out
 

E-mail (more one address), video, good sized screen, MP3 Player, compact, calendar easy sync
 Show one better, Blackberry Treo


they're not
 

I've Nokia 6680 year now, it's fantastic
 I feel sorry people States phone launched UK, came extra integrated camera, Nokia sign, allow video calling
 It's best feature ever invented, 6680s picture quality flawless,as features
The con handset battery life reduces dramatically bout 6 months, though probably true handsets constant use
 My advice



come UK buy handset here

sim/free
 

Very Nice
 Fully Customizable 




 I lOve It
 Only con is

it's slowwwwwww

 

Lots nice stuff packed compact design
 The camera surprisingly good
 

I wish I could give stars phone
 I two Nokia 6682s possession since October serious, different, flaws
 Since I bought phone Cingular, I tried get issues resolved there, Cingular refused replace 6682 similar device, despite fact I pay premium every month service
 Next I tried Nokia, directed send phone wrong service facility
 Long story short, Nokia phone 24 days expect return another two weeks
 Don't tempted - looks cool would cool cool actually worked, doesn't
 You'll stuck paying Cingular service can't use
 

phone complicated phone fidure date a"data" cell phone BUT big business person alot files manage data great> ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU LIKE IT GREATLY BECAUSE AMAZON WILL NOT LET YOU EXCHANGE











 

This first cell phone
 (Seriously


 I'm caveman
)Pros:-Great battery life
 Usually lasts days me, especially I turn backlight
 Battery indicator misleading, show full 35% left
-Bluetooth works great
-Survived conversations rainstorms
-Ergonomically satisfying size/weight
-Compatible m4a, mp4, mp3, sound formats
-Intuitive interface, part
Cons:-Weak vibrate mode
-Voice dial doesn't work well
-Lag opening 'Gallery'-- photos music
 This really problem you've hit button accidentally
-Interface isn't customizable I'd like
-Sliding camera door rather flimsy
-Incompatible synching Macs system 10
4, Nokia nothing say this
-Memory card RS-MMC, means get better card nowhere
If I say one thing I really don't like phone, it's sliding camera door
 In addition always feeling compelled fiddle (it's spring-loaded


), feels rather flimsy, instinct press part phone holding ear
 I suppose isn't big deal, it's certainly bothersome
UPDATE:Still working great two months
 One maybe fifty calls I'll get bad connection there's weird feedback microphone
 I've dropped times, too, although I'm sure I'd like drop I absolutely to
 Also, vibrate mode isn't good-- I've missed calls phone jacket pocket, etc
 But ultimately, it's still five stars
 =) 

I bought phone I needed something could used phone pda one never go wrong Nokia
 The sound surprisingly good photos crisp clear
 The video quality great
 The applications come phone include real player, opera, adobe acrobat mobile version office
 For however, 64MB card big enough I plan buying larger one
 At first I thought phone big I look phones laugh tiny screens seem inadequate now
 

I using Nokia past 4 days
 This awesome phone,perhaps best phone far 
It tons features,very easy use ,big bright screen, great Camera,speaker voice dialing capability

It much per expectations 

I bought many things Amazon first review
I researched cell phone reviews CNET sites come perfect cell phone
 I always disappointed phones reviewed must best everything, camera, MP3 player, organizer, toy, etc
 I wanted phone good calling receiving calls
 That's it
Oh I also wanted Bluetooth I could call handsfree driving
 And good vmail, alarm clock, place business, keep track friends
Yes features including spreadsheeting word processing I never really know good I take pictures digital camera instead, I listen music ipod, I type memos using PC
But phone it
Yes small keys tried Blackberry? I gotten used keys using fingernails, I must say I gotten pretty good
 However I use type long text messages
 Rather I call people talk
 Although I use Bluetooth earphone, speaker phone loud enough I probably don't need Bluetooth
It excellent brightness color I see I dialing even bright sunlight, great sound, excellect tools managing contact lists one touch dialing, configured important features one touch
 The phone comes configured going spend time surfing net, trade EBAY take pictures
 I changed suit me
 If cannot experiment get configuration right must everything simple phone may you
For me, I configured right
 

D807 Nokia 6682 two top selling phones Cingular plans
 I happened use recently
 Samsung little smaller, less weight that's advantages Samsung D807 has
 Nokia 6682 much features bigger screen, without adding much weight
 The reception voice quality excellent
 Overall, I LOVE Nokia phone
 

I definitely like full-featured smartphone
 It everything I'd like phone (and some


)
 This phone uses Reduced Size MMC comes 64M card, I felt small truly useful, I replaced 1G card less $35
 I picked Logitech Bluetooth hands-free works well Nokia
 The display large, bright vivid colors
 On side, speaker leaves little desired, voice recognition somewhat clunky operate doesn't seem "forgiving" old Kyocera
 Finally, shape definite candybar--it's almost perfectly rectangular, I've unable find decent case phone, Nokia doesn't offer one
 All all, good phone worthy Nokia name
 

I bought phone long came out, I'm impressed it
 The features great it's extremely customizable
The camera works great I found I really like sliding cover lens
The speakerphone works well me, clear
 I've never needed headset thanks this
It took time master keylock, I've Nokia bar phones made little easier
Overall, I love phone I'm pleased it
 

Having several cell phones damaged time, I got tired always losing address books phones
 I decided I wanted sync information iMac
 I carefully researched Mac-compatible cell phones, I selected Nokia 6682
 And I absolutely glad I did
 This far best cell phone I've ever owned
 I've 3 Nokia phones BellSouth Mobility & Cingular), 1 Samsung (Sprint), 1 LG (Verizon) buying one
I able sync Mac first try, although took 2 tries get two items "trusted devices
" I sync address book, calendar, to-do items effortlessly
The buttons little small, complaint, minor issue since I mainly voice dialing
 

16-Jan-2007Feedback Nokia 6682 phone based personal experiencePros:1) The menu keys fully customizable standby mode
 i
e
 You customize want access essential keys, phone use
 Remember call, phone preset assignments keys, I don't think could customized
 So applicable phone standby
You customize left selection key, right selection key, menu key, menu key, right menu key left menu key requirements
 Customizing 6 keys requirement enough quickly access favorite menu items
You variety options choose order assign key what
For example I assigned keys follows:Left selection key => CameraRight selection key => Profiles (where I choose current profile phone i
e
 Loud, silent, mild - remember profiles customizable
 i
e
 You create profiles wish)
Down menu key => ContactsUp menu key => Clock (where I set alarm etc
)Right menu key => Phone settings (where I assign keys function)Left menu key => Call logsMenu center key => Gallery (See comment # 9 cons Menu center key)CUSTOMIZE keys


 Though takes time provides freedom want phone believe worth time
2) The profiles customizable (See related note above) create profile
 OK, ask profile? Profile choose phone's behavior
 For example 'Loud' could profile customize phone's behavior incoming call, messages, key presses etc
 Say 'Loud' profile choose make phone ring loud incoming call, beep loudly incoming messages, beep key presses, vibrate incoming call etc
 You create profile assign favorite name
3) The phone separate 'backspace' key
 So punched something wrong (Say phone number) simply use backspace key erase one character time
4) The phone separate menu key
 To access menu simply press menu key bottom left
 But since I customized functionality 6 keys (as mentioned above) I rarely necessity access phone's menu per se
5) Separate 'voice command' key left side phone
 To dial someone voice, press hold button speak name person etc
 call number
6) Nice camera
 The pictures I took come pretty good far
 And course use pictures wall paper phone
7) Though keys small, precise smooth nice press, don't problems dialing number etc
8) Great silvery look9) Of course, separate memory card slot insert memory card filled whatever want to
 Music, pictures, videos nice stuff
 How much store you
 Of course want store, need higher capacity memory card
10) The hands free comes phone really good, though bit long I haven't figured shorten using adjusters provided
 The stereo effect talk pretty good
 You really enjoy it
11) Of course, blue tooth
 I haven't found issues it
 I logitech blue tooth
 It took time figure use it, get hooked it, nothing like blue tooth freedom
 I haven't tested limits blue tooth phone, get disturbances start moving away phone
 But price pay wireless freedom I guess
 Also sometimes people say hear clicking (or other) sound talking blue tooth set, problem isn't unique phone
12) Sturdy: Yes, phone bit bulky
 But turn means robust sturdy, particularly person like me, doesn't really handle gently
 It fits nicely pant pocket
13) Key pad lock: Since isn't flip phone, essential key pad phone locked put inside pocket
 Otherwise make unintended calls random numbers
 Locking key pad Nokia phone
 To lock keypad simply press left selection key press star key
 To unlock again
Note: Because fact left selection key enables lock feature, notice delay use left selection key access functionality assigned it
 This press left selection key, phone doesn't really know trying lock key pad trying access menu
 After couple seconds didn't press star key, menu item show up
Cons: (all cons low severity level)1) I haven't figured way 'Auto lock' key pad phone (say minutes inactivity)
 I know way
 I call Nokia find that
2) Sometimes I mistakenly press power button right side, trying hold phone phone switches off
3) Vibrating feature isn't great
 It sufficient enough I guess
4) The camera shutter cover smooth sensitive
 So sometimes I put phone pant pocket, opens slides opposite side
 To prevent this, always try put phone bottom first pocket, since mean pushing camera cover up, close it
5) It always obvious whenever menu, see several options available top
 These options could accessed using right left menu key scroll options
 Though pro, reason I putting 'con' isn't obvious, notice carefully get used it
For example got missed call number three times continuously, call times 3 calls won't obvious 'missed call' history, since shows time last call attempt number
But carefully notice 'call log' 'notepad' like icon scroll using right menu key access call history
 Here able get time missed calls number
 I wish gave directly call log
6) The phone always remembers last menu accessed go deep menu next time open it
 This could pro con depending personal preferences
 Say accessed 'call log' last time browsed 'received calls', next time access 'call log' DIRECTLY go 'received calls' page
 But time might wanted access 'missed calls' menu
 So go back one step navigate forward 'missed calls' menu
It might take time get used this
7) I don't think make phone display long want so
 It always times minutes course power saving
 I guess 1 minute limit
8) I wish separate volume button may side phone
 Rather use left right menu key talking
9) The 'Menu center key' accessible, sense hard push down
 Rather time try push down, end pressing menu key menu key
 So 'Menu center key' isn't easy access
10) I wish also 'separate loud speaker key', I could simply press I want put phone speaker mode
 Unfortunately isn't one
 Hence use menu key access speaker, talking
11) You cannot initiate phone dialing directly speaker mode
 i
e
 You cannot access speaker mode phone standby
 So want speaker, always make call go speaker mode menu
Other notes:Nokia 6682 user guide: http://nds2
nokia
com/files/support/nam/phones/guides/6682_CA_en
pdfHow long I used phone? 1
5 monthsI add pros cons I find more
Data capabilities: I haven't used phone much data capabilities known for
 So I unable comment data features
 So goes without saying I use phone mostly 'voice features'
 That begs question, 'Am I making full use phone features'
 The answer loud 'No'
 And question 'If using data capabilities all' really need phone? I don't straightforward answer question
 It depends personal preferences
 But want option included phone go with
 But even want great voice conversation great phone
Where I buy phone? Amazon
comImportant note buying amazon
com : If buy (or cingular network) phone amazon
com switching another network, note amazon doesn't provide number portability
 For example currently using 'T-Mobile' want switch 'Cingular' want buy phone amazon
com, cannot retain old phone number
 Amazon
com assign phone number place order
 After getting phone, might able port old phone number (provided haven't cancelled T-Mobile account) directly talking Cingular
 But catch - port old phone number directly talking Cingular (by passing Amazon
com) breaking 'Terms conditions' Amazon
com, means required pay '$250' Amazon
com changing phone number
 This applicable 6 months buy phone
 After 6 months change phone number
 But brainer one wants change number 6 months again

 He proven dishonest 
 

I phone past 1
5 years now
Features phone really impressive (1
2 MP camera sliding cover, Symbian OS, Office application etc
)It little bit heavier smartphone (Blackberry Pearls, Sony Walkman)
 Keys also small sometime troublesome operate
However biggest problem phone called "morning sickness" problem
 Phone gets frozen automatically switches every 4-5 days
 I latest firmware could solve problem
I Nokia fan previous phone Nokia
 But I disappointed phone
 

Been using phone year never single problem even I dropped several times
 

My favorite phone thus far
 I use review plenty wireless technology I glad one goes home me
 Synced Mac literally less 3 minutes
 

I hate phone
Pros: good reception, many features
Cons:Keyboard tiny hard press right one
Worn easily near edge
As heavy brick
Very slow bootup
 

I using phone nine months I didnt problems yet
Bigger displlay advantageous
 It good sound quality
 Also mp3 player good
The phone software easy use comes handy adding contacts sycnchronizing calender pc
Camera - ok
 You cant really expect much phone camera
 But takes quite good pictures enough light
 The pics blurry low lighting conditions
Battery life good too
Cons - Its bit bulky
 Can uncomfortable hold hand talk long time
Doesnt come auto keypad lock

People complained phone hangs, I faced problem once
Overall good phone I give 4/5 rating
 

POWERFUL PHONE WITH TONS OF NICE FEATURES


SUPER RECEPTION,LARGE SCREEN,THE CAMERA TAKES ALMOST AS GOOD OF PICS AS MY CANON POWERSHOT
SPEKERPHONE IF GREAT, I LEAVE IT MY SHIRTPOCKET AND CHAT IT UP




 GE YOURSELF ONE I DID
 

I'm using last one-week good
Pros:1
 Screen visble bright sunlight too
 Motorolla's Razor opposite
2
 Call Recpetion/ Speaker Phone/ Battery life charge good
3
 Camera's Image quality Ok Good
4
 Simple Navigation
Cons:1
 Just bit big
2
 Key pad space could more
3
 Camera shutter/cover dosen't fit perfectly
Conclusion: I recommend u buy this
 It it's job unlike Razor whose reception, screen, speaker phone, battery life - Compromise it's sleek/stylish design
 If want phone communication buy this
 If want show-off buy Razor
 

I got Phone upgrade current Cingular plan
 Paid 199$ upgrade business plan
 I wanted Phone primarily decent PDA functionality
 THis phone disappoint all
 However, looking high end PDA works Phone might look HP,Palm Windows CE devices
 But devices tried great PDAs good Phone
 (I thought PDA added functionality , phase basic functionity maybe Palm HP forgotten that)Pros:1
 Nokia software works fine ease
 There reported problems call logs vanishing etc ala Cingular firmware cannot fault phone though
 I waited till firmware fix came along got phone
 All seems good fix
2
 Design business look
 Donot fooled cheap display models cingular dealers keep poorly made display model justice great display(262k equivalent Razr) stylish keys albeit little small gets getting used to
3
Bluetooth connectivity good worked easily IOgear Headset PC
 Also worked without hitch connecting wifes Razr transfer contacts
4
 Software, USB cable, Headset 64MB card(not enough capacity) comes package unlike Moto Razr requires buy Razr memory slot
5
Speakers great using speaker phone home equivalent using headsets
6
Light sensing control display brightness nice touch
7
 Symbian OS fine Palm Blackberry fan take time getting used to
Cons:1
Camera Cover feels like lower grade plastics come easily
2
Infrared available
 Bluetooth works well infrared easier devices eg: Palm E3
Connectors standard i
e USB Headset(Wired)4
Memory card could've Mini SD Nokia promised stick MiniSD uses Dual Voltage RSMMC
 A little difficult find
 

This phone I even dropped bunch times still works great: flash, memory card takes great pictures, it's durable easy use
 The thing I hate bulky heavy compared phones, I still think worth it
 

I won't attend reviewing Cingular Amazon here
 I'd simply second razr asked Cingular warranty services could send different phone would actually last
 They offered replacement
In regards razrs: I finally realized phone form function
 The first lost reception - replacement problem buttons (a common problem I've read - metal template buttons great first 'sticks' malfunctions eventually)
Within hour getting phone mail, I SIM card installed, asked I'd like transfer contact information new phone
 Well, yes, thanks asking
 How simple that


 Also phone connected computer via bluetooth transferred Outlook contacts phone
 Took test pictures, test video (with sound
), transferred files computer phone


 including MP3 songs play via speakerphone (not great) included headphones (w/ jack use phone)
 Within hour I convinced I made great choice, 3 days later I'm still happy camper
I've yet tried bluetooth hands-free phone yet
This isn't smartest smartphones, I don't need something complicated treo blackberry
 The 6682 comes program view office documents, web browser (Opera), more
 If browser email program work well everything else, use programs satisfied
 I personally won't need connected internet
Reception seems better anything else I've owned
 Phone well-built (like Nokia's, I've heard)
I'm satisfied thus far
 I wouldn't hesitate recommend it
 

(Update)(Jan 06) Still love phone, issue call log dumping power down
 Cingular sent silent update well
 As memory card, The 1g Sandisk I ordered, DV back went
 I'm going buy 1gb Kingston
 The internal memory limited, could packed little more
 I bought plantronics 510 bluetooth, works great, I hate talk home phone now
 I also picked "ClearVue" screen protectors phone screen looks new again
 I sync nokia via Bluetooth Dell 9200 laptop
 My pics transferred automatically I'm less 20-30 feet away
 I syncronize enews ebooks via Mobipocket reader (uses internet laptop) saves data charges
 Also I added another program (MDialer)which predicts phone number name I'm typing (MS Smartphone built I liked feature) $3
99
 I picked Sony Ericcson z520a wife, reception great, otherwise I hate phone, nokia like Windows XP comapared DOS
 In words Nokia superior z520a
I've phone 4 days I love it
 Lots 3rd party software
 I gave Motorola MPx200 (WM2003rom)
 I liked old phone, reception
 The speakerphone also lousy
 Comparing MS Smartphone, Nokia much easier use
 No reboots
 The phone's quality excellent, feels little heavy
 nice
 Some people complained buttons, I'm 6'2" 225lbs pretty big hands fingers, I problems buttons
 The phone boots much faster MS smartphones
 The Nokia's speaker phone plenty loud compared motorola's
 I ordered bluetooth earpiece 1gb sandisk rs-mmc
 I add I recieve them
 Battery seems last full day
 It probably last longer I quit playing/installing etc
 The negative far, I may wrong, games graphically nice like Lynks Golf MS Smartphone
 Reception amazing
 Finally
 

Got phone Amazon
com irresistable deal - man worth it
 First thing I noticed I got phone size slightly larger older flip LG VX6000 bigger LCD screen made worth it
From I saw phone, Nokia put lot thought placement keys - comfortable use - I suprised ease typing text using keypad
 The 6682 5-way center button I heard susceptible wear-and-tear (read need replace) thats year two using it
 The UI clean completely customizable
Software included pretty good - The real advantage phone accessing web - simple straight forward
 I installed google local smooth works well me
 I still trying figure get pre-installed files included-64MB MMC card new 1 GB card I ordered - updated review I that
By far useful feature Sync feature Lotus notes Outlook
 I wish Activesync made easier people like Nokia done - IT bliss sync calendar vital job function I lot meetings go to
I read someone else's review said could turn phone feature could used player alone plane - done (its user manual guys
:) ) sweet MP3 player good - clear hell
 The downside MP3 feature need use custom headphones Nokia provides sucks many better headphones could use
 The phone takes kinds formats - midi, mp3, acc - sweet need get ring tone download favorite tune set ring tone set go
I havent completely checked photo feature (it priority I bought it) couple photos I took, good Nokia provides nifty software editing fancy alterations
To summarize:Top features I absolutely DIG
1
 Seamless Lotus/Outlook calendar sync2
 Active Standby - justifies calling Smartphone3
 Support multiple audio formats player control service provider (verizon made compulsory software transfer anything - case, go nokia
com download whole thing free
)4
 Complete CustomizationThings I wish better1
 Common Headphone adapter2
 SD card instead MMC (especially reduced voltage

)3
 A case belt holder (as see, small phone
) == I still havent found one - ordering Amazon - pity good phone facilityOverall - Awesome phone, great PIM (close enough PDA get essential work done), Superb MP3 player
If want phone, get - regret it

 Playlists cumbersome
 

Bought phone Cingular months ago, I love it
 Previously I Nokia 6200, I loved size durability
I couldn't get 6230 I went 6682
Pros-The size bit bigger 6200/6230, corners good radius it's easy shove pocket
Good flexible interface
 You use standby mode soft keys set phone however want
 Well done sure
Battery life solid
 If I use features (games, music, video, etc


) battery still get day much more
 If it's phone last maybe 4-5 days
Display quite nice
Camera works great outdoors, takes pics using flash screws pretty bad
 As long enough light camera useful
 I'm sure way tweak settings dial in, I haven't screwed it
Memory card slot awesome have
 I bought 512 card I bought phone wasn't dual voltage phone wouldn't recognize it
 I pretty upset that, I'll buy 1gb Kingston card soon set
Cons-The speak talk


I like use occasionally (I used exclusively 6200), I don't know I need buy license VoiceSignal program use 6682
Wish normal headphone jack I wasn't tied Nokia headsets
 I understand adapter I buy, I'd rather see phone
I'd like way shut phone part phone I use MP3 player flights
 My laptop nifty switch shut wireless NIC, I believe similar feature would allow use planes
Sometimes phone lock I'll pull battery reset it, don't know I flashed update solve problem
 It rarely happens, don't notice try use phone
 Calls get missed etc


All it's solid phone, pleased it
 I bought RAZR wife time, I impressed it, especially next Nokia
 

I bought phone Nokia 6230 bit dust
 I'll returning phone week
 My review biased sense I AVID cell phone user I use phone primarily text messaging, calendar, alarm clock, camera, music
 Here's scoop:Pros: works third party software MobiTV MobiRadio
Large screen
Camera high resolution protective cover
Reception good
Cons: small keys, need click many menus send text message
 The phone slow
 Clicking menu takes 2-3 seconds load page - I guess I spoiled Nokia 6230
 Bulky handset - heavy big
 Third party software expensive Cingular: I needed pay 20 bucks month unlimited internet 10
00 per month MobiTv, 10 MobiRadio
 Alarm clock doesn't option set alarm multiple days
 The headset ships phone two earbuds doesn't stay ears
 Intermittent "out memory errors" even upgrading memory card 512 MB
 Camera cover slips open often holding phone
 If miss call person leaves voicemail, see message saying "new voicemail" click ok, see "missed call"
 I think order reversed "missed call, new voice mail" OR small voice mail indicator
 The backspace "clear" button small awkward
Hope helps
 

I got phone yesterday long search good phone features looking for
 I got instant liking phone best phone I ever had
 MP3 player fantastic
 Comes 64MB RSMMC card, insufficient features phone having
 Atleast 512MB card required
 Camera Video features great average sufficient cell phone
 Though looks little bit bulky, features makes forget that
 Transfered files thru bluetooth capability laptop RSMMC, connection good without interruptions
 Amazon promptly shipped phone got go ahead Cingular
 Cingular took 5-7 days approve connection
 Signal reception good till didn't experience dropped calls
 There many features explore phone
 Overall great phone steal away deal Amazon offering
 

I bought month back
 This phone pretty much everything wanted including MP3 player, camera, video, lot custom applications
Pros:- This pretty good aspect reception great- Battery life average- Having features like have- PC synchronization easy install given software- Bigger display 256K colorCons:- Somewhat bigger- Once camera cover opens, starts camera application even keypad locked
 Thank GOD while, camera goes standby (may prevent rapid battery discharge little)Over great phone Nokia brand
 

The american cell phone market little variety comes GSM phones, phones offered providers older technology, stuff came years ago countries
 However, cingular finally brought phone worth calling home about
The Nokia 6682 easily one best phones money availiable now
 Cingular released time ago, customers reported multiple software issues
 Months later, phone re-released, looks great
Body, form factor: Sits comfortably hand
 It looks bulky, really heavy
 You'll know falls pocket, won't break thigh you're wearing tight jeans
 The buttons easy enough press, way you'd hold camera shutter accessible
 The shutter looks amazing, sightly rickety
 I keep worrying breaking it
 It's sturdy phone, looks classy, business like
Call quality: Great, even one bar signal
 This limited onlyby cingular's network, supposed over, hey, I lose reception walking building
Battery Life: I recharge every night
 I listen music phone lot, around 2 hours day, least, especially I run, I lose 2 bars battery end day
 I don't make many calls, I play symbian games
 I'd suggest getting better battery nokia relesaes one here
Screen: The screen adapts light, going darker you're low light region turning key lights, going brighter sunlight
 This great battery saving feature
Memory Card: The phone comes standard 64MB Dual Volt RS MMC cardn hold, well , almost nothing
 I bought 1GB card forabout 20 dollars, I love it
 The little slot sleek, easy use
Music:The inbuilt music player good, sorely needs keylock feature
 I downloaded free player (
ogg player) I use I need lock phone, it's good inbuilt player
 speakerphone allows play music, don't expect make party happenning
 The headohones nokia gives sweet, comes audio quality, tha later
 The phone play 
aac, 
mp3, 
mp4, 
m4a, 
ogg, 
wma files
 If phone came slot headphones, would close perfect
 I bought kittle headphone adapter, I use regular headphones
Camera: Great Camera, daylight it's dark, try taking pictures yellow light low light look really bad
 In dark, you'd use flash conjunction night mode, else, picutres won't good
 The digital zoom okay, worth praising criticizing
 I wish dedicated camera button, like bar phones
 The camera covered slightly rickety slider, looks really nice
 The video camera sketchy, use regular camera replacement digital camera
Data features: This phone features great connectivity
 The built browser good, Opera (which pay for) seriusly awesome
 The phone uses EDGE, class 10 GPRS, possibly better phone US market
 I accessed email easily enough, looked couple mobile sites, don't use feautre unless you're willing shell cash Media Net
Messaging: The keypad easy enough use, still won't threaten benchmark set Nokia 3310 (3390 US)
 The keys could little bigger, still great use
Software: reason Symbian awesome, one use phone show how
 If I started talking it, I wouldn't stop, I'm going start
 I tell Cingular's modifications phone hot
Fun Stuff: You use mp3s ringtones (I'd reccommend "Show live"-Audioslave, sounds impressive)
 You also install run lot Java games impressive graphics, well applications work Symbian
 You also watch videos 3GP, get converter free online (Ithing, I haven't looked yet)
 The media gallery nice, takes cake image manager, shows pictures ring, ones closest magnified ones behind
Connectivity: Great Bluetooth, infrared
 EDGE
Other things worth noting: Freezes sometimes, gives low memory warning open ceterin programs games
Accesories: Nokia provides stereo handsfree/headset stay ears unless glue in
 However, audio quality excellent, better lot headphones I've used
 I bought nokia activity headset, HS-8, sucked, worst audio quality I've ever endure (Looks pretty though)
The charger sleek, easy carry travel
 The data cable good, you're trying transfer 700MB music, either leave overnight use SD card reader (I bought mine buck amazon)
The verdict: Great phone, anyone tech savvy
 Can serve replacement digital camera (for casual images) mp3 player
 Better phones market
 Snap up
 You won't see many phones good US
 If still want something better, try Europe
 

Only problem I face, grip phone talking good
 All features I want there, I using almost year, still see phone good
 

I'm sure many people wrote reviews amazing phone


 I won't go details future-rich is
 You even turn navigation system (check http://www
66
com/route66/products
php?cid=US)


I switched horrible motorola v600 phone (never motorola
) phones reception stability 100x better

 I highly recommend phone anybody looking peace mind making phone calls

 

impressed service provided amazon cingular
 recieved product within 3 days, well upto expectations
 

This great phone, kind phone I looking for
 It everything mp3 player, camera/video, voice recorder, office (to-do, calendar, notes, etc synchronizable outlook), internet (e-mail), tv/radio others
Also, comes Symbian OS
 You transfer mp3 songs, pics files easily via computer
 It much features going exciting discover them
The problem phone phone buttons, close bit tricky press correct one
 

Its nice phone good features
 Voice cannot recorded morethan 1 minitue
 good phone like this
 otherwise, good phon
e 

I bought phone Cingular store yesterday
 I played features throughout day many hours last night
 Lugged around used talk text message (T9 predictive txt works)
 I opted surf net phone, I require least 17" screen actually enjoy internet surfing
 Oh, I try GPS system phone 


 trial software allows two tries required pay registration
This entire experience I wanted first place
 I wanted fancy phone, I NOT want PDA
 This phone TRIES PDA phone, I used Blackberry 6682 phone falls well short convenient PDA functionality
 This phone NOT light


 PDA, yes, regular phone, NO
The form factor barely acceptable cell phone
 The front facia excellent design
 I problem getting used key/button layout
 The quality buttons superb
 The navigation button center efficient
 The size screen extremely large cell phone
 The display extremely bright brightness display controlled light sensor located top left area phone
The BACK phone hand desired
 The camera located back cheap, cheap plastic cover protection
 The cover easily slid open slip pocket


 cell phone SHOULD allowed do
 It comfortable feeling thinking camera lens would exposed anytime without noticing
 You avoid buying belt clip possibly phone cover
 I belt clip person
The speed phone much faster old 6820 phone
 Browsing 6820 really tough task
 I memorize shortcuts phones 6820 never could keep shortcut access, I always WAIT screen show pressing next step
The performance 6682 (Symbian) OS acceptable
 When start idle, takes brief moment get going
 After that, chugs along acceptable speed
 It took approximately 40 seconds boot I turned off, including entering password
Learning everything located takes while, nothing really intuitive
 The clock located OFFICE folder instead SETTINGS
 What's daylight savings time? I turn hour jumps ahead messes time
 I turn time back normal, mean automatically adjust daylight savings?One neat thing configure placement buttons
 Seems like phone pretty configurable
 I able get rid default right button point web MUSIC
 It's nice able this
Get real, 1
3 MP camera resolution really bad
 There NO focus
 The cost phone, customer expect something better cheap 1
3 MP camera
 Utterly useless, intrusive physically hold it
 You avoid using camera forget it
 If left camera, consequently omitting cheap back cover, phone would MUCH attractive
 Seriously
The RS-MMC (Reduced sized MultiMedia Card) conventional memory card used everywhere
 I believe SD used future Nokia devices
 Unfortunately, unable implement SD card idea 6682 phone
 Therefore, RS-MMC obtained inexpensively
 Sure comes 64MB RS-MMC card, last I checked, 40MB available default
 Let's see store entire album music space


 not
 The RS-MMC card adapter turn size regular SD, stick SD card reader device
Oh, I sure I attach photo individual phone book contacts
 I tried find manual, come across option
 I imagine feature would left smart phone
 I probably can't find it, I don't feel like looking information online


 I'll tell later why
My old 6820 phone missing automatic security lock I enjoyed back days I used TDMA phone
 This 6682 phone security lock included
 You set time phone lock password, nice case phone gets stolen
 Especially smart phone, would want valuable information secured
Two good functions phone
 The sound quality headsets/earphone (included) good high quality MP3 player
 The speakerphone quality loud, play music better enjoying earphones
The reception phone pretty good Nokia phones known be
 I bones signal quality, it's great
 The talk time, battery, strong
 I owned one day I say much


 I've taken photos, listened music played virtually applications entire day I don't see battery bar going all
This phone heavy, I mention already? I gotten tired now
 Trying configure text messaging phone period time makes aware weight phone
Oh, that's right, "smart phone"
 Well, I finally understand smart phone another way describing phone everything "half-donkey behind"
 I give 3 stars ratings, between
In conclusion, I satisfied phone
 It much I need efficient enough I want be
 I returning phone something little less snazzy
 This I care investigate online utilize phone
Pros:Nice interface - huge screen, crystal clear abundant colors
Buttons works me, configurable
Good reception
Case nice LOOKING around
You use old adapters device (i
e
 car charger)
Cons:Oh camera feature useless
CHEAP plastic cover lens & accidentally slide open without notice
Phone becomes noticeably heavy period
OS intuitive, prepared take time learn it
Tons applications, require purchase trial use
As now, phone unlocked
 

I've phone months now
 I'm kid I could see kids would love type phone much stuff
 All I wanted good sound loud enough hear
 It deliver that
I went flip phone one
 To disable keys almost impossible
 You fast easy hit buttons edge unless using hands, start over
 What makes really bad want enable keys
 The screen turn touch keys
 You don't know phone locked
 You must hit power button light up
 If accidentally double hit button, turns off
Many times using directory push 4 position key cause get Internet


 ten cent charge
 Each month I charges internet use I never intentionally intended get internet
I say Plantronics Voyager 510 headset works great phone


 much better Jabra models
 

Pros:Very good form factor, Good RF reception, Good sound qualityGood camera 

 even lens cover
Camera takes good quality pictures 

 music player pretty good loud phoneCons:Keys small close otherSoftware totally useless want synch outlook
Connector Stereo head phone bulky
Standard 2
5 mm jack missing
Lens cover feels cheap wiggles
No way upgrade software
These may seem like small items, annoy quickly curse phone
Comments:It's good phone 

 doesn't work PDA functionaliy, software bad
 I love Nokia 

 much better phones market today spend money this
The new phones many features pushed vendors aggressively, ability uprade phone software makes phone unattractive
If want PDA phone MP3 player 

 Sony better solutions though standalone phone 
 
it's excellent
The manual rather skimpy 

I recently ordered new phone also 3 phones
 I already existing customer cingular
 I talked one customer service people Amazon assured I purchased phones I could use phone numbers I already had, WELL case
 They prepurchase numbers cingular let carry new number you, ridiculious, customer service people cannot tell truth, buy products them
 

Hi guys,Nokia 6682 best smartphone ever seen till nice know cingular leading wireless provider providing piece
 The voice clarity awesome size said big nothin like reasonable size
 Some find large flip phone due feel comfortable
 So would recommend piece best one go goin cingular r offering free














Dont forget upgrade memory card 1Gb enjoy features max

>supplied headset awkward use, adjustment mentioned manual, I think many like design

mine stay box
>somewhat big still fit pocket>camera cover slide open easy

increases battery comsumption unaware open, happened 3 times>average battery lifeall I still happy phone


 

I bought phone couple months back till date I extremely happy it
 It's bit bulky somehow I like sleek ones
 I feel good it's weight
 It wonderful camera @1
3 MP slot memory stick
 A 8MB stick also comes original box
 So photo freak consider bigger stick
 But casual photography stick sufficient
Being Nokia, doubt navigation ease use
 The software good task ease
 I problem installing software installed, problem all
 I use occasionally
Just reminder people try compare PDAs

Nokia phones best simple reason best reception phone manufacturer market
 Yes, I know reception large part depends service provider, reception vary phone manufacturer Nokia best department
Pro's- Excellent reception (I even get full bars underground subway station)
 I Cingular service Hoboken, New Jersey- Very good camera phone- Nice, big screen excellent resolution- Very easy use, good functionality- Keypad easy use keys raised
 Good text messaging
Con's- Its bit bulky heavy- The Blue tooth capability work Hands Free Link car (2006 Acura TSX)
Overall great phone highly recommended, don't get phone Hands Free Link system Acura
 [


] 

I got 6682 insurance replacement phone went sliding highway 75 mph



 :( The increase size took get used to, I like solid feel palm size phone
 The screen high resolution 1 meg pics look good computer
 As long newer computer good internet, loading drivers synching software - tedious - works well
 This phone replaced Palm Tungsten practical purposes


 alarm, date/appointment minder throw picture taker
The web based stuff slow, adequate getting information cell phone


 news, weather, e-mail emergency
I tried blackberry products, phone knowledge, I have, I recommend product
 If music buff, I would recommend higher capacity card
 If card loaded gills, phone tends hang good things I said go window


 :)All best,Jay 

Before I Buy ANYTHING, I always research read EVERY review
 I knew phone I going get I got it, MUCH better I expected
First I Like big bulky
 People seem forget TOO SMALL THIN means easy lose fragile
 I like I feel phone times big protrudes
 EVERYONE loves phone
It AMAZINGLY customizable, I upload MP3s installing easy use software runs like Digital Camera
 I use MP3s ringers change phone themes, Camera works really well, sounds great, bluetooth nice good headset, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL RECEPTION IS AMAZING
 I Went VERIZON CINGULAR NYC area I barely tell difference Im sure hard tell
Razr good phone If want little different everyone else, go this
 

This phone AWESOME


 After two half months research, I settled phone, I happy I did
 It's way phone first all
 Despite however, still damn good phone
 So want phone, phone it, would waist, much more
 So far phone DVD player (with Finding Nemo, Anchorman, Coming America ON THE PHONE), it's mp3 player (280+ songs) it's NES super Mario 1, 2, 3, Zelda, 30+ games, it's got bible phone, got kamasutra it, got Microsoft word Excel
 It's got program I put class schedule, phone goes silent class, back normal classes
 The 6682's camera nice, memory issues
 That's main problem many people run into
 When much once, sometimes phone asks close apps
 For example, 1 4 pictures I take, WHILE listening mp3 player, phone wants close mp3 player, phone can't save pic unless I do
 Pictures nice, don't use zoom
 Voice clarity good
 Some fun things know
 You play mp3s 7-9hrs watch dvds 4-6hrs, estimated
 I've never done way empty, I can't say exactly
 

This phone everything business professional needs (and things don't)
 The Symbian OS makes perfect base expandability without limitations Palm's PDA-centric design decisions
Pros:-expandability free commercial software-the Active Standby screen great-excellent battery life-easy access memory card-easy desktop syncing INCLUDED cableCons:-camera cover cheap easy open-headset connector non-standard-memory cards hard findAll all, great phone budget-minded professional
 It won't cost $300-400 similarly powered Windows Mobile Palm phone would cost
 

This well featured phone multitude features capabilities
 However, aspect I want rate signal quality
 This far one best phones getting good reception
 I know I use Nokia phones future
 




















































































































































































































































































If I speak softly voice isn't picked all
 In turn I repeat time
 I recently picked Jabra retractable
 It's quite cool looking, works WAY better it's smaller
 











Finally reasonably priced charger
 I couldn't find one would fit phone stores I live one place I $22
00
 

Used replace asian travel adapter
 delivery quick product worked wonderfully 








































































































Totally worthless
 It's supposed fit Nokia 6126, fails miserably
 It's cheap plastic, probably less structurally sound phone
 The back plate fit okay, marginally
 The front plate didn't fit all
 I assume price they're counting fact one going go hassles returning it
 If option negative stars, I'd give that
 

























































































































































































































































































































































reason gave 3 stars phone feels cheap
The phone exactly way described, coming Nokia price expected something "solid"
 Though, phone work says do
 cheap platic feeel dont like
 About phone being"unbreakable" doubt it
 The sim card cover almost broke trying open it
 If dont mind cheap feel, go it
 It works
16/11/08I adding review using phone 5 months
1
 The battery washout
 I replace battery since one came phone stopped working month ago
2
 The screen goes even fully charged battery
3
 Some buttons choose want work choose to, workConclusion: This phone imitation Nokia
 I cannot believe Nokia allow poor workmanship phones
 two Nokia phones using years without problems
 My candid advice: Avoid phone
 

Trying find great CAMERA PHONE that's unbreakable:) LIGHT TINYTHIS PHONE COMES w/ additional unexpected features: MP3, VIDEO recorder:) NICE


YEAH, Nokia always BEST
 





















































































Having purchased new N-Gage QD month ago, I say far I impressed pleased
 The phone contains features available high-end mobile phones, plus special features pretty astonishing
 The obvious advantage system gaming capabilities
 The screen, though smaller Gameboy Advance, still large enough allow window gaming world; don't feel hold right eyes see what's going on
 The graphic clarity awesome, game sound excellent adjustable
 You easily change games fly (my phone case even includes special pocket store games)
 Outside gaming environment, phone fully functioning PDA Internet access, built-in wireless Bluetooth communications more
 With minor adjustments, display full-length movies play MP3s
 The device supports music tones well polyphonic tones, Internet interface made better size screen
 It's intuitive phones smaller screens
 Unlike predecessor, QD's phone also intuitive; hold flat end ear
 (On previous version, phone held sideways
) If problem phone, though, phone itself
 It's difficult hear people end ether saying
 Actually, phone works best speaker phone
 In short, I recommend phone pretty much everyone
 My wife bought Motorola V400 day I got QD; already regrets it
 

I bit hesitant reading crash burn original N-Gage
 It sounded like complete flop
 However, seems though Nokia may redeemed releasing new improved N-Gage-the N-Gage QD
After wrangling Cingular get internet working, I finally way exploring full capabilities phone
 Obviously main draw gaming function I'll cover first
 I impressed clarity sharpness picture
 Games load run fast keys allow quite bit versatility
 You get used controls pretty quick opinion, easy say, Gameboy Advance
 So far I played Ashen, Tony Hawk & Tomb Raider, quite fun
 You forget gaming PHONE awhile
 I even purchased Nintendo Emulator blast playing games childhood, including Super Mario Brothers Castlevanias
 The sound pretty loud small speaker, really surprised me
Now phone really is-a phone
 I thought I would compromising functionality actual cell phone game features
 But fortunately I wrong
 I little criticisms
 I originally owned Sanyo 4700 4900 I wanted phone similar offerings (speaker phone, voice dial, speed dial, ergonomic, etc)
 First thing-thank God talk sideways *this* N-Gage
 You actually hold like normal phone
 And although lot carrier, reception clear crisp
 The speaker phone works much better 4900 since I use headset time, I appreciate easy access jack
 Battery life awesome, especially rapid charger takes 1 2 hours & gives anywhere 24 hours heavy usage several days light usage needing another charge
Other cool functions MMC card slot expandable memory games (again easy access - removing battery insert card like old N-Gage), Bluetooth (which awesome especially PDA dongle PC/laptop), notepad, voice recorder, image viewer, list, ring tone composer, video player (software includes Real Player) image viewer
 You even play MP3's watch movies look right place
All great phone
 The gripes come mind are: aren't able play MP3 QCP ringtones, can't display picture incoming call, decent case difficult find (hint - Nokia 3300 fits almost perfect)
To sum I would definitely recommend phone a) like games b) want phone lot cool stuff
 

This Nokia phone didnt sell well still one best cell phones there
 I purchased phone week ago im lovin it
 things you'd expect phone some
 play games it, watch full length films (if big enough memory card) surf web
 sleek design fit pocket
 great buy anyone looking multimedia center palm hands 

I've owned N-Gage Qd since Christmas 2004 I must say I impressed phone clearly unlimited potential
 With service known N-Gage arena compete gamers around world similar XBOX 360's XBOX live
 Create buddy list, get phone numbers, text call make friends
I would highly sugest buying Glimmerati, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, Crash Nitro Kart, Ashen, Rayman 3, Sonic N, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Lara Craft's Tomb Raider



all excelent games $7 local EB games GameStop
 With purchase memory card download music, full length movies (with big enough memory card) best download NES,emulator N-Gage enjoy unlimited fun price $100 pre-paid cingular phone
 

With United States falling number 5 technology across world
 It doesn't surprise see Nokia forced take step backward Ngage
 It's hard get games catch Mobile gaming many people demand games multi format options; take games upgrade phones
 I first Ngage built Radio along MP3 player functions QD has
 I use Cingular I love phone
 Even though I load games memory cards via removing back cover
 I think it's much safer
 If anything, I would made back cover capable packing away one two memory cards games plate instead redesign QD, removed radio way
 The Ngage still lacking earbuds
 If money purchase bluetooth headset, rock look stylish
 Otherwise, best option earbuds come phone
 Doom doesn't play Ngage



that majorly SUCKS
 Overall, I would recommend phone new Walkman
 The Walkman ludicrous price QD available you
 

Ok, first things first
 I used phone nearly year stolen last week
 While phone definitely advantages disadvantages, I lookout new phone almost immediately
Pros:As I'm sure aware, phone designed function gaming system well cell phone
 I thoroughly enjoyed playing Tony Hawk, NCAA 2K4 football, Red Faction Tomb Raider
 All games fun often functionality GB Advance equivilent
On note, I carried phone pocket keys, loose change, etc
 The screen great job resisting scratches
The layout phone makes easy navigate menus, although menus somewhat counterintuitive
Battery life surprisingly long, even playing games several hours
Texting breeze, seamlessly connected messages callers phonebook
I also found metric/US converter program useful one occasion
Cons:In year, I never met another person either owned knew someone owned N-Gage
 So much mobile-to-mobile gaming
Although phone much smaller original N-Gage, I still felt like I carrying around brick
No camera?
?Forget putting phone pocket without keys locked
 I'm sure many times I connected internet, called friends, etc I forgot lock keys
Towards end year, seemed battery needed charged frequently, even though I playing games less often
Games pricey
 I paid 50 phone, games retail 35 (assuming find them)
 For I suggest looking online, find great deals
The rubber protection around outside phone fell 9 months
System overload? On countless occasions phone would lock up, freeze quit responding, I turn restart it
 This gets old quickly
Summary:As phone, I think N-Gage mediocre best
 It lot functions newer phones have, lacks appropriate interface access them
 It took nearly year truly develop proficient knowledge phone, I consider fairly tech-savvy
As portable gaming system, I think N-Gage quite remarkable
 There quite variety games available, although look online find them
 The games full-length features (including secrets) PS2 counterpart
If you're looking great cell phone, I would look elsewhere
 If you're looking decent cellphone portable gaming system kill time, N-Gage definitely better Snake Minesweep
 

Pros: Speakerphone, built-in gaming/data storage capability standard sd memory cards, easy navigation joypad, flashy features like bluetooth
Cons: Speakerphone requires connection turn on, nobody else know I play strangers internet play games, User interface intuitive - strangely complicated nokia phone, No EDGE?
? 

Pros -1) Wide screen still compact phone
2) Sleek looks & Amazing gaming experience
3) Smart phone loads options, I personaly like bluetooth & NotesCons -1) The screen brightens suspend mode instantaneously
 I would love brightens slowly
 thats way old ericson used work, easy sleepy eyes
 It used lit gradually wade gradually too
2) Carrying I wearing tight jeans pain
3) The processor sometimes slow
 Browsing Contacts take seconds (2-3) sometimes gets annoying
In opinion, Its best buy money
 

Dis da' N-Gage
*P
S
: 50 Cent Bulletproof gonna best game ever
*My favorite game ever Big Rigs: Over Road Racing
 whoever says bad game, screw you
The Ngage favorite system yet, games like Tomb Raider, sucks, Pocket Kingdom, cusses
 And I like cell phone
 The cell phone made girlfriend, I first get "n-gaged" dream ran away man owns PSP AND DS
 And PS2
 And Gamecube
 And X-Box
 And GBASP
 And N64
 And Sega Dreamcast
 Which suck
The suckiest game Halo, da' bunnies?Metroid Prime bunnies either
I like bunnies
Bunnies cewl
Ngage delicious, I ate one one bite, I thought taco
 Everybody asks I talk taco I'm using Ngage, people good sense humor nowadays
 They kick groin, laugh me, either run drive away
 Today mayor kicked shin, it's bleeding, I think best sense humor all
Well, actually mom does
 She kicked eye, I can't feel toe kicked eye
Everybody calls new word cool called "Demented" sometimes even call "N00bs
"I call words like "Buddy" "Yommama
"Everytime I call somebody "Yommama" mamma come make Apple Fist
 It tastes like blood, funny mammas
Butt N-Gage TODAY
 Or shall "Cool Person"
 Yeah
Now, everything review lie
 If beleive I written, eat Apple Fist
 It hurts
 And 50 Cent: Bulletproof gonna blow
 























































































Pros: comfortable, compact, lightweight comes attractive useful storage pouch
Cons: people end hear loads ambient noise, even loudest setting, I barely hear call
I like idea headset, I returning it
 It wasn't loud enough
There appear sound quality volume issues Body Glove needs work on
 It possible low volume problem related phone, LG L1400
If buy headset, make sure get retailer good return policy
 I bought mine Best Buy, I stopping work exchange different headset
 






















































Seems everytime I switched cell phone towers I lost connection
 Screen difficult read outside day
 Ring tone low, missed 2 calls cell phone would heard
 Couldn't see anything set wrong alarm would buzz, even listing tones select set up
 Volume low used handset bluetooth mode car
 

I must honest, I shopped around looked lot phones
 I also must admit I never one cell phone 4 years ago service horrible area
 I able return cancel contract I told salesperson supposed sell phone area I live in
I thought I would take chance looking hundreds cell phones I pleased Nokia 6300b I purchased
 I liked iphone sleaker much easier learn use, fit better suit garb
 I found pictures nice 1600 x 1200 resolution
There one thing I need know anyone answer
 Nokia support closed Sundays, big bummer I need find maximum SD card memory phone
 I found good deals 16gig I don't know support much memory
 The person company I called place order (not Nokia) said I find maximum memory purchasing kit that's sale $59
00 includes card reader
Can anyone please tell maximum SD card Nokia 6300b series?ThanksPhil 

Este ha sido el mejor telefono que tenido
 NO es de gama alta pero todas las funciones est&aacute;n adecuadamente organizadas
 Lo mejor es su dise&ntilde;o, su peso liviano, la resistencia los golpes es altisima
 La pantalla LCD de 16 millones de colores es muy buena
 Las fotos que tomado de dia son de buena resolucion
 Para escuchar musica es agradable
 No lo dudes, compralo
CONTRAS: Solo acepta tarjetas microSD de hasta 2 GB, si le pones una tarjeta de mayor capacidad el telefono se bloquea
 La camara tiene flash
 El sonido que registra cuando graba un video es malo
 

This phone great
 Hot, slick design
 Works perfectly gsm provider, better origonal phone
 Great sound clarity
 Absolutely love it
 

For price, phone one best i've ever had
 Good battery life, good screen, good reception clear voice audio
 It's slim light bulky like lot flip Blackberry phones
 You carry shirt pocket without problem
 

Let start saying I many phones last 8 years, one best, THE best
 The screen BRIGHT
 It looks good adjust brightness
 The menus epitome intuitiveness
 Call quality great, although volume could little higher
 Overall well built piece technology
 I would definitely recommend phone anybody looking great phone
Pros:1
 Bright screen2
 Easy use menus3
 Excellent call quality (voices sound clear crisp)Cons:1
 Cannot adjust screen brightness2
 Call volume could little higher 

I previously last phone Nokia 6080 I always fan Nokia
 I using phone AT&T;'s old service wanted something unlocked time expensive phone
 My main requirements solid reception, good battery life ability record calls (given fact days many bad customer service reps various companies)
I done quite bit search find something fits requirements inclined 6126, 6555
 But flip I wanted avoid flip phones I can
 Came across Nokia 6300b impressed features price Amazon (it $166)
 Went ahead purchased it
Usage experience:- Battery comes 6300 issue
 Standby time 36 - 48 hours
- Talk time less 2 hours
 I've heard use DL-5 batteyr instead DL-4 comes phone, battery life increases
 But DL-5 fit right away need modified- You disable GPRS, Bluetooth etc using increase battery life- Old nokia chargers won't work
 If many those, better converter- Used Kingstone's MicroSD card (2 GB) works nice- Mini USB cable came camcorder / digital camera used connect Nokia Nokia PC suite- Reception ok I get 2/3 bars time home works time- Call conversation recording give beep tone audible parties
 Therefore silent recording
 You use talking company cust service
- It nice feeling hold I careful entering numbers
 If large fingers need even attention
- Screen bright looks good
- S40 OS quite quick- My package include cushion comes earphone (for handsfree) package carelessly packed- There strong hissing sound using handsfree connection
In all, I happy phone except battery
 If looking candybar style phone bluetooth memory, good choice
Good luck 

I really liked celphone

Unlocked, Great screen, mp3 player, nice 2
0 mgapixel camera

it cute phone, small adorable

great I liked it

 

This great phone died months use (no signal reception
) I thought problem since warranty
 Boy I wrong
 Nokia's warranty repair center took several weeks update software return phone unrepaired
 Then I sent back returned unrepaired 2nd time
 This time claimed would repair phone since mysterious "corrosion" hadn't noticed first time
 I buy Nokia product due terrible warranty service
 

I really like phone
 Good reception, good keyboard, nice screen, metal construction, easy use menus, slim size easy hold, FM radio music player work well
It 'candy bar' style phone deal keyboard locking, careful scratch screen, dropped several times apparent damage
Have used camera
 My opinion need good photos, use camera, phone
Battery life good, don't use bluetooth expect battery last quite while
This model is, I believe, made Europe 'real' Nokia, distingushed made China Nokia model I got wife
 That Chinese-made phone cute array problems
 

Altough bit old, phone everything one needs practice use
the sound quality good, menus easy navigate,fast phone sturdy (steel case)
it adecent web browser, supports bluetootha good simple mp3 player expandable memory via mini sd
another great feature battery life: moderate use last 4
5 days
the cons are: 1
 low quality camera (only 2 mega pixel) 2
 it's 2
5 generation phone, making mobile internet bit slower supporting video calls
I enjoy phone much, recommend everyone need sturdy, practical phone
 

phone works well looks good well
 However, fault back cover phone
 It doesn't close properly
 Besides that, I satisfied it
 The case came appealing earphones given along great

I give 8 half 10
 

I bought I surprised elegant complete cell
It everything anyone could ask for
Not good USB cable sold separately
Need strength speakers
Need little sound headset
No battery lasts long time manual says
But price purchase again
 

Mobile looks good
very bad receiving calls,lot distrubance
poor battery(even single call bettery getting drained 10 hours)
This first BAD item I bought amazon
com 

I bought phone replace aging Nokia 3650 3120 phones
 I wanted another candy bar style phone, lots modern features
 The 6300 seemed good price, Amazon sells unlocked version works great old AT&T; (before merged Cingular Cingular became ATT again) SIM card
To answer someone's question comment below, phone made Mexico
Pros:- The Amazon version unlocked price actually pretty good
- Slim design
 About size Moto SLVR
 It might tad bit heavier, it's wide
- Lots great features: Bluetooth, 2mp camera, MicroSD support, USB support, voice dialing, voice recording, etc
- S40 interface pretty easy use fairly responsive
- Transferring/deleting/moving files phone memory surprisingly fast
- Screen nice bright
- Speaker loud clear
- Build quality solid
- Reception seems better older 3560 3120 phones
- 2GB microSD cards really cheap easy find now
 Just one card provides enough storage ringtones photos
Cons:- The phone's aluminum body seems retain heat
 Just holding hand makes really warm
- The phone won't charge USB port
- The side top buttons bit hard press
- The camera lens exactly I normally rest index finger back phone
- Only supports 3gp h
263 video (176x144 @ 15fps)
Overall, it's great phone
 The major cons doesn't charge USB gets warm I hold it, positives still outweigh negatives
 

My Nokia 6101 Tmobile-to-Go good, I still preference candybar phones, I coveted camera resolution
The Nokia 6300 works T-mobile, "unsupported"
 Inserting SIM card account immediately gives telephone, text messaging, voice mail
 Nokia provides online configuration tool gives multimedia messaging T-zones
 T-zones limitations phone
 It won't provide download games ringtones
 T-mobile's webpage provides configuration tool unlocked phones, 6300 among models
Voice quality excellent
 The Nokia 6101 tough competition that, 6300 possibly exceeds it
 In building I work T-mobile signal good window, drops nothing deeper work area
 The 6300 works deeper T-mobile phones I used
The display provides beautiful color backlit low ambient light
 Under bright incident light appears monochromatic
 This good
 It provides excellent readability direct sunlight
The 2 MP camera good substitute stand-alone camera, could nice something photogenic happens better camera isn't me
 It noticeably superior VGA camera 6101
 However, get 2MP picture phone requires data cable card reader
 MMS messaging set maximum resolution 640 X 480, actually sends portrait shaped pictures email maximum 480 X 360
 Landscape shaped pictures transmit 640 X 480, landscape shaped picture gallery transferred phone data cable, taken old 6101
 Landscape can't selected, 6300 can't rotate portrait shaped images takes landscape
 Incoming images email get shrunk even smaller
Keys small
 Battery life bad, shorter average
 I think better design would use slightly smaller landscape screen, make phone little thicker, give heftier battery
 That's current fashion
The 6300 slightly longer older less expensive medium sized Nokia candybar phones
 Being thinner fits leather belt cases work chunkier phones, case flattens enough accomodate extra length
I able transfer phonebook 6101 Nokia Suite Windows using CA-42 cable, I transferred 6300 using DKE-2 cable
 Cable sold separately
 I hope Nokia finished coming new cable standards
 The data port 6300 plastic cover nothing grasp
 The trick opening seems remove battery cover find edge dig fingernail into
 Linux seem recognize phone data cable
 The micro SD card read adaptor reader linux
 The phonebook cannot copied micro SD card
While would nice slightly better design available, 6300 seems good choice far among available
 

I using Nokia cell phones exclusively long I wireless account, 13 years counting
 The 6300 another fine example exceptional design function Nokia
THUMBS UP:- form factor super-slim, super-sexy "just right" kind heft it;- design spot gives phone "rich luxe appearance" reasonable price;- continuing tradition super easy-to-use Nokia phone menus; you've never used Nokia phone before, won't take long figure basic functions;- feature set adequate no-nonsense phone; extraneous features;- microSD support means 2GB whatever want [MPs, pics, games, videos, etc];- 2MP camera digital zoom basic picture effects;- average phone loudspeaker; MP3s sound pretty good
- programmable softkeys allow unique customization quick access used apps;- gorgeous screen
- easy use Nokia software makes synchronization, backups file management breeze
THUMBS DOWN:- battery life pretty poor thus far [blame gorgeous screen];- camera poor low light less ideal conditions; lens cover;- default ring tones loud enough, solved use MP3s provided already pretty loud
That's pretty much it
 This terrific phone make worthy companion
Check new Nokia 6301 6300 UMA support [so make cell calls open wireless networks]
Of course, I love new Noia 6500 Classic, aluminum monoblock beauty


Cheers,-mariusar 

I pleased phone
 While lacks bells whistles N Series, phone do, perfectly might I add
 The display, ease use, simplicity interface, reception, etc, make lack gadgets buttons
Furthermore, feels incredibly sturdy solid, brushed aluminium components detailed, clear screen
My reservations regards it's non phone components, namely lack mirror flash camera
 While well lit day shots come well, indoor low light situations leave little wish for
I would recommend phone without reservations seeking good, elegant simple phone
 

I loyal Nokia customer
 I used bar phones years always appreciated durability & reliability even though weren't sexiest phones
 Well 6300 old reliable Nokia qualities go great style
 I love phone
 Nokia really stepped one
 Being AT&T carry phone I buy unlocked
 No problem using standard sim card AT&T
 My contacts everything switched over
 No need purchase software mini usb cable sold seperately
 I able download software (Nokia Suite I believe called) Nokia site able sync phone outlook using mini usb cable Creative Labs MP3 player software downloaded
 Once I synced calendar contacts Outlook I use Nokia's customer service via web allow send receive multi-media text messages
 That easy


they sent settings straight phone I punch pin number send ready go multi-media messages including sending pictures phone friends & family
 I make similar request customer service begin receiving AT&T's Media Net easy follow directions
 The cons: I wish battery lasted little longer - I charge every 2 days
 To get cap mini usb port takes little effort call volume could stand little louder
 But like like Nokia & bar phones want modern up-to-date phone love 6300
 

Excellent item, fast shipping


 Very good camera 2 MP, bluetooth, USB port, mp3, fm radio, microSD card slot


 

This amazing device
 It intuitive elegant
 This phone pleasure use I issues (besides trying get t-zones set I don't really use anyway)
 If want well made device please buy phone
 It worth every cent I paid it
 I day already feel like I figured out
 I able install 2 gig SD card upload music via bluetooth ibook without even glance instruction booklet
 Nokia great
 I t-mobile Dash 3 days worst phone experience I ever had; dropped calls, hard dial, terrible interface, etc
, phone amazing
 The interface well-designed, smooth, efficient, great pre-installed ring tones graphics
 It stylish
 The physical form one best I seen mobile device
 ZERO complaints
 If want solid well built candybar phone buy now
 love it
 

Got White-version Nokia 6300 wife
 She loves form factor
 slim, aluminum battery cover, camera pouch
 Unique white color (compared black red)
 Great sound camera
 Downside battery life since small capacity battery needs support 16 million color screen
 Small internal memory (7
8MB usable) save SMS
 A safe buy
 Go it
 

This phone great
 Not high tech some, beautifully designed
 The reception far phone I owned, sound incoming outgoing loud extremely clear
 The speaker phone fairly underpowered, battery life par
 That said, positives phone far outweigh negatives, everything works, well
 Best phone I ever owned
 

Sophisticated stylish, best Nokia phone years
 Terrific build quality, great menus slim form make user friendly every sense
 




































































I USED THIS PHONE IN THE PASSED AND WAS AMAZED OF THE PICTURES I SHOT WITH THE CAMERA
I LIKE THE NOKIA MENU , WHICH IS VERY EASY AND HAS EVERYTHING I NEED
 THE ONLY HANDICAP IS THE BATTERY ,THAT NEEDS RECHARGING VERY OFTEN




SO I SEARCHED AND FOUND IT AGAIN ON AMAZON
 I BOUGHT IT AND I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT




 































































































































































































































$600 low end phone GSM phone? No 3G, GPS, wifi anything expensive iPhone full featured Android? Wow worst deal century
 










It's good basic kit
 Charger fine; job (5/5)
 The case ok; protects phone well (4/5)
 The earpiece so-so; sound could little better, price, it's adequate (3/5)
 

Nothing much write product here
 It task
 Quite reliable affordable
 It got 10$ (the cover costs 10$ sold seperately)
One negative factor
 The cover "fit" screen properly fold
 Hence reading text screen little difficult 

I feel great product great price
 I enjoyed product every much
 My complaint product ear piece alittle big ear
 I continue tell people product get great price
 













I've looking good way hold cell phone working
 I don't really like putting back pocket may get damaged sitting
 I hate leatherette belt clip holders shiny plastic overlay
 This clip solid, holds phone perfectly, rotated fit way wish (horizontal vertical inbetween)
 I satisfied
 


















































For reason don't list phones headset fits
 The MX510-N3 specifically works Nokia 6101 (T-Mobile) 6102 (Cingular)
 If you're wondering phone work model visit Plantronics web site show exactly headsets fit phones
I've used MX510 weeks found functions perfectly
 The volume control excellent - able hear people highway background noise
 The answer button, least Nokia 6101, plays double duty channel changer you're listening FM radio
 This great extra use radio
When I first purchased Nokia I didn't realize used proprietary accessories
 (Had I known I certainly wouldn't chosen Nokia
) I quickly discovered made difficult find accessories I wanted
 Specifically, I looking headset mic came closer mouth
 This model one I could find came close
This headset bit peculiar people might skeptical design, indeed work
 The big drawback, however, lend comfort
 Whereas past I could head style headset hours without discomfort, MX510 I use half hour begins hurt bit
Lastly, model, despite features, severely priced
 This probably due proprietary nature working Nokia phones
 If standard 2
5mm jack headset, model, like standard headsets, would definitely sell less
 

I LOVE headset
 I used constantly get complaints friends couldn't hear clearly
 I would often find holding headset closer mouth heard really eliminated "hands free" feature old headset
 I poked around Amazon found great Plantronics headset uses "voice tube" technology cut external wind noise, comes two different leghths tube
 I love options
 Not everyone sized/shaped head it's helpful choice rotating earpiece fits comfortably ear
 It wasn't description, headset also features one-button pick-up/hang-up, volume control mute button
 

No one knows I headset


 sounds great, switches ears easily, comfortable
 There nothing improve one


 makes Jabra model I seem like toy
 

My boss always complained I driving road talking him
 Now I MX510-N3 Windsmart Boom Headset ask "Are driving?" can't believe much road noise cancelled headset
 For reason talk longer rush get phone me
 He claims quiet I setting office
I need Plantronics make fit 3650 3595 Series phones
 I buy more


 

looks swanky slick however actual use insert causes irritation ear use
 would recommnend u go conventional circular inserts ears
 yeah reception sound crystal clear
 mean disturbance intereferrence sort
 

I never much luck cell phone headsets - either I can't hear person I speaking cannot hear me
 I spent little I wanted hoping would work does
 The proof came I plugged mid-conversation caller wanted know I disconnected headset
 They said I sounded clearer (even car AC high)
 I also hear much better plugged without (no shouting
)
 It little uncomfortable while, I willing live given big improvement sound quality
 

It sounds loud clear
 It takes little getting used to, moderately comfortable
 The volume feature answer/hang button great convenience
 

This model support Nokia 6600, I gave three stars
 I nothing say product, since I returning it
 It took two weeks get, discover info provided right
 Pretty disappointing :( 




I Had This Phone For Like 5 Years And I still Use It
 The Games Are ok nothing like ds psp still cool
 dont want carry anything else beside n gage,keys wallet
Its also easy use thats long
i dropped like 8 times still works
You also change fceplate thats good
I love phone 

bought cell 2005 gave brother year after
it much fun


u download lot games music u good memory
 problem rubber band





it used drop time 


























































































































































Nice looking functional case, but, I like velcro fastener
 From past experience brand cases velcro fastening loses it's initial grip
 At point grip becomes poor device may fall it
 














Even though packaging indicates Nokia 6682, definitely work phone 

This belt holster good quality
 Not recommended buy
 Plastic gives cheap look grip good either
 My phone got dropped holster couple times esp, removing car seat-belt coming car
Better cheaper options available websites
 

I think person gave negative review probably received wrong belt clip
 Mine fits perfectly
 It's obviously going survive rock climbing expedition marathon, it's meant to-- functions quite well I'm using for
UPDATE:Ironically, day I wrote review clip shattered unceremoniously I getting car
 It'd probably work well enough office work walking street, much else
 Cheap plastic go far
 









































































The cable resistant, long looks manufactured quality durable
 You may connection problems Nokia PC suite, easily fixed going control panel, add/remove programs, updating nokia connectivity driver
 You may find solution Nokia web site forums
The cable work fine, without problems
 You access phone external unit, work content PC Suite
 Be sure 1 gb 2 gb sd memory card phone, whole package serves well
 

The nokia replacement charger old cellphone backup works great every time
 It came quickly packaged well
 The price great cheaper retail stores
 Thanks
 

This one paid well me
 It works mobile phone perfectly
 I would definitely recommend friends
 Thanks
 

It exactly said was
 Happy it
 And importanlty works
 You need download software nokia's website really straightforward

I placed order two CLKBP5L batteries
 I received two CLKBP6M batteries instead
 Hopefully Amazon/Target make things right
 


I bought case buying MobiMan vertical case N8
 The vertical case worried I felt one day I'd try pull phone would slip fingers fall
 Let break pro's vs con's BoxWave leather case:Pro's:1)Fits phone well holds phone snug2)The Holes cut leather match opening phone relatively well (eg camera speaker openings)3)The mechanism attach/detach phone belt absolutely great
 it's easy operate, makes easy slide phone belt answer call
Con's:1)This biggest issue item: there's BUTTON latch close flap, moronic
 Why couldn't use magnetic clasp?? it's incredibly difficult snap button latch closed (since it's back case) incredibly difficult open quickly need answer phone
 Currently I attached velcro pieces flap front face case, makes SO much easier open close flap
 Eventually I'll try attaching magnet clasp instead (you buy craft stores even Amazon)
 They should've used magnet begin with
2) The lip case surrounds screen raised makes difficult type landscape mode, hit keys near edges
 

I first purchased another type cover I leery screen covered I purchased cover too
 I must say I happy I did
 The cover stylish simple get phone
 It magnetic clip make easy open close one hand
 I wear it's belt clip remove clip slid phone pocket
 The best thing I actually got test protection cover thanks zealous sweetheart
 I crouched looking clothing I interested sweetheart decided cart would fit body post behind me
 My phone hit hard permanent 2
5" gouge scrap front flap well smaller scrap getting knocked back side
 Phone never got touched thanks cover I pleased about
 This cover going used work purposed (inside padded carrier I work construction) I ordering new cover going such
 

Good Nokia N8, leather flip cover, problem flip get torn time, recommended protect phone, little bit pricy
 































































I've several bluetooth headsets, far worst I've ever used
 First, doesn't come charger, expect already Nokia compatible charger order use it
 That surprise, since I found one lot searching I thought I'd OK
Before charge phone install battery yourself
 This isn't simple you'd think
 The battery connector tiny takes fair amount fiddling around get right
 Not big deal perhaps
 But one many examples poor design
Next, first headset I've seen password 0000 1234
 Since I'd already thrown box away I go searching trash find scrap paper number I could pair phone
 The headset charging hour, left lunch thrown top box
 Why couldn't use standard PIN? Or least put PIN manual? By time people charged phone they've thrown box without knowing one several 4 inch square pieces paper needed
 If I ever needed pair another phone I'd find stupid piece paper again
 Not smart
All would OK dang thing worked
 It doesn't
 It loses connections Treo time
 Whenever I connect causes volume control come Treo, something I've seen headsets really annoying
 And sounds terrible



 People end call sound distant there's lot echo, I'm told voice barely understandable due echo static
I learned lesson Nokia products time ago, I thought I'd give 'em one shot
 That mistake, headset garbage belongs
 Don't waste money poorly made, poorly designed, piece know what
 

I can't say I problems folks above
 Agreed world's best BT headset, quite deserving three stars, especially ~$30 things go now
I problems connecting battery - took 30 seconds ready charging
 The pair code last 4 digits serial number, lose code card, look battery
 Again, convenient, often need pair headset?This one headsets body module separated earpiece
 Therefore much comfortable wear over-the-ear designs popular now
Audio quality mediocre, passable
 The buttons sometimes hard press, case somewhat flimsy
 If drop headset, you're almost sure break tabs battery cover
In summary, I would say unit usable $30, prices drop quality increases competing units, unit become less attractive
 

I used product 2 weeks, got constant complaints people I trying talk to
 It seems problem bluetooth hands free kit, mic located earpiece, strain pick voice
 For example, quiet office environment, might end talk loudly
 If background noise, forget it
On receiving end, I also found sound quality pretty terrible, I might attribute bluetooth wireless connection
I could honestly recommend product anyone
 I ended returning mine
 




I bought replace Motorola unit I lost flight, partly I prefer Nokia (Married Finn, I'm biased, though SHE bought Motorola gift)
 Worked fine weeks, suddenly wouldn't take charge, turn anything
 I let sit deciding whether replace battery send warranty repair/replacement
 Then, yesterday, I plugged charger and, surprise, started charging works
 Go figure
 The thing lacks holster medallion clip alternativevs carry unit like Motorola
 But, $20 less, I live that
 Actually, unit fits "M" holster
 

It hard find earpiece I liked
 The Nokia one I've owned
 I've year
 I really love earpiece, it's comfortable, since I Nokia phone, actual songs assigned callers play ear, I love that
 When I Sony phone, Nokia tune played earpiece
 Remember try let unit's battery drain charging again, otherwise eventually hard keep charge
I tried pick little gadget Cingular store, wanted $100
, I bought here
 

The range great, tested Motorola V3 able get much sixty feet phone hear bit static
 The volume controls nice, even voice dial it
Unfortunately, uncomfortable ear, volume controls touch small
 Try dummy unit buying it
 










I headset year didn't major problems this
 Initially connection dropped times times fine
I another problem I switched headset, cell phone went mute
 Then I started follow proper procedure disconnect it
 Disconnecting cell phone switching off
The sound quality better phone itself
 If use properly best buy
 Sits behind ears
 

Looks little spacey works fine
 Charges charger Nokia phone uses
 Has good range
 No problems
 

volume control poor, & hearing dificult headset picks outside noise
 Would recommend
 
























































































This tip well entire iGo system works perfectly me
 I use charge phones, Ipod Kindle
 I wish battery designers better job wouldn't dependent devices
 















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































unplugged phone, little piece hooks phone broke can't pull out
 worked fine cuz don't use headset left piece still works
 

Does fit phone advertised fit
 Had buy another one elsewhere
 



















































This battery knock-off version Nokia ones
 The casing thick battery make contact phone
 Therefore electricity actually gets phone
 This battery useless
 DO NOT BUY
 Don't try skimp like I did, get real battery made Nokia
 


I ordered battery Monday received following Thursday, good
 Also battery exactly I needed I don't charge phone everyday now
 

The seller sent item immediately
This battery seem hold charge long original battery came phone good deal price
 





This product connected clip via screw back
 If screw comes loose like mine did, you'll lose cellphone too
 Then you'll screwed I was
 

This product alright
 I love durability hard exterior case (saved phone times) shock absorption neoprene interior
 However, case annoying sense bottom front cover gets way top 2 buttons use navigate menus lock phone
 The phone also big make much use belt clip
 









One corner clip broke hold one corner phone longer
 This happened inside 2 months result dropped mishandled
 The plastic corners thin
 

For part, fairly nice phone mount
 It's got sturdy feel it; I'm worried breaking coming loose
 It also holds phone snugly
 The phone snaps distinct enough feel I've never let go thinking locked wasn't
 The swivel turns eight distinct segments ranging horizontal one way horizontal (you can't keep phone upside down)
 Once rotated want it, stays position
I've experienced two minor negatives
 The lesser problem tricky release phone holster
 I suspect that's mostly familiarity problem, though
 The significant issue belt clip portion sticks straight regardless phone rotated
 The top part clip, slightly rounded, still fairly hard protrusion
 It jab belly if, like me, waist wider belt
 It's ok I'm standing, get annoying I'm sitting down
 

Perfect go don't want one ugly leather holsters cover entie phone
 Your cell phone snaps out, even swivels
 

Great product half price
 Arrived within couple days
 Everything perfect transaction, usual
 

This good belt holster
 It holds phone tightly place stays belt
 Yet, snap phone one hand
 Can also talk charge phone holster
 

I purchased one month ago, morning broke
 There extraordinary use unit, daily clipping belt
 The hinge mechanism extremely low quality
 The price accessory great, definitely get pay for
 Now instead 1, I 2 pieces crap
 

This good product
 I spent products turned made well
 My cell phone fell clips I purchased thankfully I found cell
 This product secures phone well made well

 VERY pleased
 

After seeing much Nokia wanted USB accessory cable ($45), I decided head Amazon fraction cost


Thanks much


 

Was able successfully perform firmware update Nokia 6086, even though it's listed description
 I would think cable used phone requires CA-53 (check Nokia's website complete list)
 

The cable exactly supposed - transfer data

 Just treat gently hold nicely
 

This product I purchased Amazon I looking price right shipped timely manner

This cable OEM cable manufactured Nokia
 It works perfectly Nokia 6126 phone using Nokia's PC Suite connectivity software
 It exactly it's supposed do
 The price great, I received fast


 so, what's like
 

This OEM cable works perfectly Nokia phones intended
It indispensible synchronizing phone PC Nokia provides excellent free software job
 I use 6126 manage contacts, media, themes
The cable along Nokia's software even allows users use phone modem connect internet cellular provider's network
 This probably efficient cost-effective means connecting internet useful certain circumstances
 

I got real Nokia cable works perfectly Nokia 6126
 Unfortunately, Nokia's releasing firmware update 6126 I hoped


 

This cable
 It correct USB cable Nokia 6085 camera phone
 The cable nothing Nokia PC Suite software phone's firmware, review somewhat redundant
 It's wire
 It either works doesn't work, item works
 

Use cable connect Nokia phones computer

 I always use 6086's bluetoothfor data movement
 sigh
 Maybe Nokia update firmware again
 

The cable worked well phone computer able read it
 




























































Great charging go
 Retractable cable makes easy keep with, good storage
 The knock inserted certain direction order work well
 

We two home
 One still rolling along 6 months age
 The second one bought lasted 3 months died
 I guess get pay perhaps cost amazing I love retractable cord
 Tough
 

The charger works wonderfully
 I hope lasts while
 I like cord retracts way doesn't take alot space
 

This item broke (mechanically) 5 days use
 A little screw tht holds two parts body gone loose whole device disassembled 

I bought reviews good - however, using twice longer making connection phone order charge it
 The retractable feature neat though
 It 30 day warranty course stopped working 30 days
 Oh well
 

Thjs excellent product
 The ease use excellent price make outstanding value
 I love retractable cord allows easily move phone around collapse cord done charging
 This worked great Nokia phones
 

It works great, beautiful blue light, retracting wire practical
 Very cute useful item
 

This product good good
 It good car compact small
 

I love cord retracts
 My old one I always getting caught things jerking cigarette lighter
 I'm inclined get case I lose something
 Works great, convenient
 

























This thing works GREAT

 It take little "wiggling" get haven't used awhile
 Otherwise, says works great phones, Nokia 6085h
 

This good cable, like others said, kind jiggle bit get fit
 I used Nokia E70
 The thing is, I try update it, says won't work laptop, it's USB hub? That problem Nokia's updater, cable though
It's great moving photos music, though
 No problems whatsoever
 

This works simply great
 I used Nokia N73 works expected
 Very well manufactured I would definitely recommend this
 

If buy original cable, costs arm leg
 This cable works great good manufactured
 Would buy I loose one I have
 






















This deal good true
 Of course I wasn't expecting name brand stuff here, least I expected work
 I don't know I got bad earbud what, adds static noise therefore cannot used
The case I didn't need, fit well looks decently constructed
 The power adapter seems work fine
 So basically I spent $9
99 using power adapter
 I guess that's good enough deal
 I think I'll go spend extra money get brand name earbud/headset though
 

I agree "it good true" statement package
The material used earbud charger really cheap 

 Thecharger melted car sunny day, I couldn't even test it
 Earphone quality good well, giving constant humming noise
 The case best three far
 So one three 10 bucks
 I recommending anyone buy item
 

I wouldn't recommend product one
 The phone cover really sucks
 I used product month



and clip cover peeled off



really disappointed purchase
 

The case ear bud fine, car charger I sent doesn't even fit Nokia 6230
 That main reason I bought package
 

I disappointed 3-piece starter kit Nokia 3220
 The vinyl casing constructed cut-outs proper positions (i
e
, camera hole opposite side; casing covered phone tightly, made pressing buttons bit challenge)
 The ear piece doesn't work consistently broke first day I used (with camera covered vinyl casing)
 I haven't tried portable power charger, I cannot comment it
 Overall I disappointed package I received
 
































































































































































































I love phone, I've four months works great
 True bluetooth infared works well
 Only fault back case little loose still stays that, one keeper







 

I bought extremely useful daughter 

Nokia released 3 (ONLY 3, 7610 NOT part group) Art deco mobiles looks
7260: The Smallest cheapest7270: The Mediam clamshell7280: The Expensive masterpieceSince phones made looks, I give 7270 one star
 I phone month, ugly looks cheap, also worst assembly makes look cheap imitation toy rather $500 mobile
As functionality, phone works great, great display, great features, bluetooth though
So seek envy, crank wallet get 7280, seek envy functionality, crank wallet ALOT get $1000 Nokia 8800
 But If u seek supremety, get ready max lot plastic $40,000 Nokia Vertu Signature series
 






































































































































































I've trying make work three days now


Keeps disconnecting headset (Motorola H300)Very big dissapointment, throw money equipment
 

















































































































This product advertised sized Palm Pre, small
 I recommend
 

I need lanyard pocket version carrying case regular cellphone
 This fit bill expensive options
 My elderly mother law carries cellphone outside get paper safety blanket phone call ever fall
 

thing really helpful doesnt help scratches 











































































































































































































































































Very good product Nokia
 Controls well laid easy use
 No problem pairing phone
 Also dongle provided PC stream phone receiver
 Just one problem, bundled ear phones made music sound like mono radio, pathetic
 Use good earphone everything becomes wonderful
 

Much better newer fancier stuff sound quality want
 Made mistake buying Sony ericsson mw600 borrowed Nokia friend, settings, phone playing, music, headphones difference unbelievable
As person said though, get decent headphones
 









































Just I looking for
 Perfect fit Nokia 6030
 Well made neoprene secure swivel clip
 And 5 year guarantee manufacturer
 The price right I got FAST
 






















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































NAZTACH ULTIMA CASEVery pleased product cost
 The item arrived promptly
 Would definitely recommend product
 

Husband's phone fits well
 No excuse take
it along him
 Fits great belt
 Thank 

Second one I've owned
After two years frustration multiuse phone felt like brick required much babysitting, I went back simplicity clamshell phone
 Then I scoured Internet I found case grabbed it
Perfect every way
 Really
 

The one fits phone
 It's 2nd oneI military type Samsung phone
 Hope thisone last phone
 

This case nice
 It trim workmanship great
 The flip great woeks well
 I use small phone
 It smaller flop phones still sold
 I kept chance I find small phone next change
 I smart phone user flip phone choice
 Again, superior case high style smaller flip phone
 

Exactly I needed Samsung flip phone
 Looks classy works great
 We'll see long hook lasts seems made well
 

Great case dressing up, or, casual
 Very well made looks good
 Great value


 

All cases I've bought phone retail outlets broken within months
 This one holding quite well
 Also, magnetic "clip" eliminates another potential mechanical failure
 Excellent choice
 

After comparing hundreds cell phone cases, one
 Great quality, great style, great convenience
 

We purchased son Christmas - nice quality - HE LOVES IT 
 

I received Naztech Ultima Cell Phone Case Truly Black disappointed find "360 degree Swivel Belt Clip", advertised, instead standard pinch-style vertical belt clip locked position (the kind tends fall belt whenever bend waist)
 Even packaging included case listed "360 degree Swivel Belt Clip*" one product features
 However, tiny asterik package informing buyer 360 degree Swivel Belt Clip available cases
 Of course, information available on-line ad prior purchase
 This kind false advertising "non-similar substitutions" reflects poorly upon Amazon influence family's decision purchase Amazon
com future
 

It said good small/medium flip phones, extremely tight fit phone
 Every time I put in, hits buttons side sets voice commands, turns speakerphone
 It waste money
 My phone small Samsung flip
 

I purchased holder Amazon time ago smaller cell phone
 Its long I remember exact phone I used on
 I bought Iphone going replace holder another Naztech
 This item fantastic regards
 The magnetic flap keeps ticking
 I expected degradation time never occurred
 Great styling fit clip
 Cannot say enough good things item
 A steal price
 

This case strong sturdy case
 It's made well
 It looks good, feels good worth every cent
The top flap secure closes
 It's uses magnet secure flap strong
The clip back tight strong
 It also swivels, nice feature
The thing I would say I wished fit little tighter around phone
 That's minor compared quality thing
 It's great
 Love glad I bought it
 Well worth money


 

I saw amazon
com, I liked antique brown color, pure leather look
 Unfortunately, I got it, didn't look like posted online
 It looks feels like plastic
 far I still sure leather, leather smells all
 I really disappointed
 

The clip broke first day
 Bah
 Went Verizon got better made case
 It much better
 

Take notice
 This item swivel clip described
 As reason I selected item others, disappointment
 It otherwise nice product
 

Great case
 Well made provides excellent protection cell phones
 This second purchase product Naztech managed make even durable time
 Highly recommended
 

Very sturdy well made
 Will perfect protection I looking phone
 Very stylish too
 Wish I got another
 

I bought Wife
 We Same Samsung flip phone, since I black pretty easy please terms I can't get
 However, get brown leather case kind easy
 For reason usually side, upright style phone holders
 Its easy open, plus wife since difficulties Velcro tabs I like
 It basically closes itself, seems
 Anyways, great looking, easy use, fab price, delivery prompt
 Kudos Naztech great quality round superb service
 























































































I don't like phone havent beginning
 I owned 6 months still don't like it
 The battery life terrible, keys small makes text messaging difficult
 The speaker low quality making ring tones sound cheap
 The seal around glass covering screen began leaking 3 months ago recently cracked
 I would reccomend phone anyone
 And reception poor even metro Atlanta
 

Luxury phone


 best Nokia models ever
 still popular, Legend
 battarey works bed but
