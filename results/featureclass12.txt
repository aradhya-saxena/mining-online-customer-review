screen:  Color screen voice recorder, you'll find something you'll like

phone:  Gone days could unlock phone call contact within second

phone: NOT even 'entry level' phone would useful basic functions

screen:  Entry level screen see light reliable ringer

screen:  Display brightness adjust contrast useful making screen harder see improve

screen:  Using wallpaper white makes screen impossible see/read text even indoors dark room

screen:  Fonts setting enlarge (Nokia knew screen junk) text small display prevents this

screen:  Screen back-light doesn't always light first button pressed

battery:  Battery time good likely due screen dimly lit

screen:  Battery time good likely due screen dimly lit

phone:  fail basic functions cell phone pretty bad & acceptable

phone: 00 take phone

screen: I see highly rated don't understand be, unless screen visibility concern reviewers

battery: Also, signal strength battery power indicators difficult see - minor points considering AT&T; functionality (damnedgood) rapid battery charge rate

price:  The highest price AT&T; ever charged Nokia $9

phone:  A phone phone, portable entertainment system

screen:  Thanks magnifier specs, I don't squint screen anymore

phone: Phone awful - $149 phone available prepay $20 $25 free airtime? They send 'free" - lock 2yr contract charge 10x actual cost phone ETF

phone:  There reason renew contract get simple phone

phone: As seventeen year old female, I tend use phone lot

phone:  I got phone without texting, I still love it

phone:  ;PThe problem I phone I nickel allergy, metallic looking finish menu surrounding buttons caused face break rash, long I use easy-to-use speakerphone button, get good cover headset, I fine

phone: This phone easy even 60 year old father computer inept mother figure out, minimal help me

phone:  Remove Baby Bell service home business, plug unit phone jack cellphone cradle

phone:  From phone home business, including cordless phones, operate exactly like always have

phone:  The benefit?? You features, plan advantages cellular phone

phone:  It great small business owner take phone leave, leave place allow calls go voice mail

phone:  To place Nokia phone cradle, one sets cradle phone vertical

phone:  I accidently broke one I remove Nokia phone without damage, must tilt phone front cradle removal

phone: I use 2 line cordless phone throughout house

phone:  Now, I use cell phone (via extensis) throughout house without losing call due poor cellphone reception

battery: This merchant, AccessoryOne, blatantly lying say battery "New

battery: " I got order today battery obviously new:1

phone:  The terminals scratched phone previously in

battery: Battery good

phone: Bought second/spare battery work phone heavily used, helped lot

battery: Bought second/spare battery work phone heavily used, helped lot

battery: Battery arrived brand new lasted well year

battery: This high capacity version battery

battery: That info wasn't specifications, fact Nokia OEM battery

phone: What I need say? It inexpensive, charges phone

phone:  I received phone brother (he used work Nokia Texas) phone broke (nokia 6102i) contract Cingular another year (yeah, sucks)

phone: Background: I eligible upgrade yet, meant I purchase phone retail price (without contract) would run upwards $300 more

price: Background: I eligible upgrade yet, meant I purchase phone retail price (without contract) would run upwards $300 more

phone:  So I got phone (unlocked) gift, switch-over relatively easy trouble-free

phone:  What I able move photos I snapped old phone

phone:  This phone exception (except one I discuss later)

phone:  flip) phone almost slim (but slightly lighter than) Motorola RAZR

camera:  The camera 1

camera:  The photos decent daylight, great poorly-lit areas (but goes every camera phone I've ever encountered)

phone:  The photos decent daylight, great poorly-lit areas (but goes every camera phone I've ever encountered)

phone: There large 1,000-contact phone book room entry five phone numbers, e-mail Web addresses, job title company name, work home street addresses, birth date, etc

phone: I tested quad-band GSM phone San Francisco/Bay Area using existing Cingular wireless service

phone:  I got quality old Nokia 6102i phone

battery:  A minor drawback design MicroSD card slot located behind battery cover

battery:  Although, don't need remove battery itself, need remove cover

battery:  My beef battery life

battery:  However, I paired activated Bluetooth, connected Nokia BH-900 earpiece (By way, BH-900 earpiece sub-standard compared Motorola HS850, another review altogether) I got feeling battery life standby

battery:  For half day minimal use (20 min max), standby rest day battery 20-25% capacity

battery:  When I turned Bluetooth, I able go full day use still 50% battery capacity

battery:  So seems Bluetooth feature activated eating battery juice (which makes sense)

phone:  I yet find control tells phone automatically turn Bluetooth active device around

phone: Conclusion: The Nokia 6126 nice phone many features

battery:  I gate 4-stars battery life

battery:  Nokia improve battery life, easily done patch automatically turn Bluetooth Bluetooth devices around

phone: BTW, phone still offered Cingular

camera: A mistake I notice lot people making reviewing phone compare phones boast dual functionality MP3 player camera

phone: A mistake I notice lot people making reviewing phone compare phones boast dual functionality MP3 player camera

phone:  They throw certain features standard, features alone supposed selling point phone

phone:  The 6126 PHONE first rest afterthought

phone: PROS:-THIS PHONE IS POWERFUL

phone:  Anyone customized his/her phone theme knows LONG takes apply one(albeit seconds, thats eternity)

phone:  This phone previews seconds

phone: -THIS PHONE IS RIDICULOUSLY CUSTOMIZABLE

phone:  change EVERY aspect phone, menu presents many minutes want phone wait hit snooze

phone:  For really intricate stuff may take menu clicks find option, I customized internal displays 1)screen saver (when first close phone) 2) Standby screen (10 sec phone closed) 3) Flip screen (what picture external display shows flip open phone, you're holding ear decide people see)

screen:  For really intricate stuff may take menu clicks find option, I customized internal displays 1)screen saver (when first close phone) 2) Standby screen (10 sec phone closed) 3) Flip screen (what picture external display shows flip open phone, you're holding ear decide people see)

screen:  Oh, EVERY button main screen customized shortcut - almost never need go menu screen

phone:  Anyone uses Microsoft outlook love quickly easily phone syncs bluetooth

phone:  The rest suite little cumbersome side since vista allows send files directly phone right clicking file, I find useful

phone:  With flip button pull phone flipped open ear one smooth motion

screen: -Screen - I constantly keep changing wallpaper make use bright beautiful screen, external screen actually 262thousand colors, thats much phones main screen months ago

screen:  The internal screen 16 MILLION colors, gorgeous

screen:  I currently 3 3D rings twirling external screen clock

screen:  screen many colors, animations look beautiful

battery: CONS:BATTERY LIFE - Not necessarily bad 2 days, sony ericsson spoiled ridiculously long lasting battery

battery:  Even display said empty, battery would run additional 8 hours standby

battery:  Still, I disappointed battery life, although yet put HEAVY usage

phone: LOOKS - I'm young guy (23) sorta want fashionable phone

screen:  Its simply hard worker sorta rely screen savers stand out

screen:  If want player thats integrated, would go 6555, lose flip function I believe smaller screen

phone:  Nothing special, again, phone doesnt brag feature rather considers standard day age

phone: CONCLUSION: For price, I dont think phone beat entry level phone

camera:  Plus I camera music player I dont see need (although I REALLY wish cingular would bring back Sony Ericsson K790)

phone:  This phone wont turn heads, keep you

battery: UPDATE: Okay, figured extend battery life almost week (on standby)

phone:  This stops phone constantly connected data network saves ton battery life

battery:  This stops phone constantly connected data network saves ton battery life

phone:  Also, first days, plug phone charge much possible

battery:  You definitely notice increase battery life days

battery:  The battery needs "warming time"

phone:  I'm huge advocate phone

camera: I read reviews I buy products, I little scared buy phone everyone kept saying battery life really bad, camera button always gets pushed "accidentally" pocket, sound really bad (in headset)

phone: I read reviews I buy products, I little scared buy phone everyone kept saying battery life really bad, camera button always gets pushed "accidentally" pocket, sound really bad (in headset)

battery: I read reviews I buy products, I little scared buy phone everyone kept saying battery life really bad, camera button always gets pushed "accidentally" pocket, sound really bad (in headset)

phone:  Well, I bought phone used it, none became problem

battery:  The battery life fine - people probably got recalled lithium-ion batteries

camera:  Also, phone closed, keypad automatically locks camera button take pictures packet, whatever

phone:  Also, phone closed, keypad automatically locks camera button take pictures packet, whatever

camera:  Also, people complained camera "grainy

camera: 3 megapixel camera phone - pretty standard time

phone: 3 megapixel camera phone - pretty standard time

phone:  Some phone 2 megapixel possibly 3 megapixel camera, expensive (by way, less megapixels, storage, I like I put songs phone ringtones)

phone:  So wanted phone good phone I'm able comment music picture-taking ability

phone:  You may well start throwing away manual comes phone - totally useless

phone:  The phone really excellent options it, definitely need discover yourself

phone:  If want save phone's contact list computer, don't bother free Nokia phone manager software

phone:  You get pay for, go datapilot-dot-com purchase Datapilot software sure purchase bluetooth connector phone - Datapilot won't work Nokia USB cable requires proprietary connection device (in case phone, Bluetooth connector, way cool)

phone:  That software plus Bluetooth connector cost phone does, works cell phones you'll able transfer contact list phones need to

phone:  The phone uses Themes background graphic screen display

screen:  The phone uses Themes background graphic screen display

phone: The Nokia basically decent phone lot capabilities, inexpensive purchased AT&T; contract

battery: PS: haven't problem battery life use cell phones intermittently charge every night

phone: I've phone 5 months, compared previous phone, Motorola V557, Nokia 6126 sad

phone: CONS:-Battery life horrible - one phone call pretty much drain battery, starts go down, really goes fast

phone: -The button open phone unnecessary caused phone open pocket several times

camera: -The camera button outside resulting couple pictures taken inside pocket (the way I found fix turn automatic keyguard minute two)

camera: -When someone calling, camera button pressed, phone answers speakerphone mode - I found today

phone: -When someone calling, camera button pressed, phone answers speakerphone mode - I found today

phone:  Turns phone bumped pocket, either chapstick hand I grabbed it, hearing inside pocket

camera: -The camera horrible - really, really horrible

camera:  Luckily, I didn't buy phone camera capabilities

phone:  Luckily, I didn't buy phone camera capabilities

phone:  I never got feature work right - phone seems take long load picture I wasn't able receive calls, would ring twice image loaded person would got voicemail because, end, rang rang

phone: -I never found way change phone lets know missed call, I don't think can

screen:  The main screen displays missed call open phone, doesn't make sound vibrate let know remind you

phone:  This phone designed carry pocket

screen: -The main display screen sometimes gets dirty

phone:  This wouldn't matter would flat surface instead embedded top phone

phone:  Again, definitely pocket-friendly phone

phone:  Sound vary depending person's phone antenna reception, but, again, I never problem either Motorolas

phone:  Actually, basically phone people techno-advanced people

phone:  It's like toy phone

phone:  The main things I miss V557 option arrange phone numbers speed dial number rather alphabetically, Motorola's "iTap" text entry

phone:  I would got another Motorola, I really didn't want Razor, slim phone matter

phone:  Needless say, contract AT&T; up, I'll switching company better phone options

phone: EDIT: After I could finally upgrade got Palm Centro, I gave Nokia phone brother broken ancient Samsung phone

phone:  He used Nokia short time decided use another old phone friend gave him

phone:  He also pictures inside pocket, phone also would open pocket button

phone:  He waiting forever able upgrade phone allows MP3 ringtones could "House, MD" theme ringtone

phone: I ordered phone form Cingular (ATT) today third defective phone came mail

phone:  A customer service rep told 85% returns exchanges come model phone

phone:  The first phone handset speaker didn't work next 2 were, words customer service rep, "DOA" -- dead arrival

phone:  It would really nice phone worked though

phone: I recently purchased phone AT&T; replace old, low-end Motorola V180 phone

phone:  I basic cell phone user; I make maybe 2-300 minutes calls month, send text messages, that's it

camera:  This time around, I wanted phone camera maybe MP3 player, 6126 fit bill

phone:  This time around, I wanted phone camera maybe MP3 player, 6126 fit bill

phone: - The user interface good, much better old phone

camera: - Camera resolution (1

phone:  It sounds better old phone gets better reception

battery: Cons:- The battery life terrible

phone:  My old V180 would last whole week standby, cheapest phone could buy; 6126 lasts 2-3 days

battery:  I fear bad it's going battery starts wear out

phone:  Sure phone play MP3s, really going carry around set Nokia-specific headphones that? This part really annoys me, MP3 player portion useless IMO one major reasons I picked phone

camera: - Camera quality poor

phone: Overall, I'm ambivalent phone

battery:  I like design features, battery life proprietary connections really annoy me

battery:  I already expecting below-average battery life sub par camera, benefits I expecting outweighed concerns me

phone: There several good points phone

phone:  I'm sure I'll miss next phone doesn't it

phone:  The problem release button sometimes accidentally pushing pull phone receiving call

phone:  If phone set automatically answer opens, release gets pushed accidentally, it's call don't want take moment, you're stuck holding phone closed stops ringing

phone: Moving phone's problems: One might assume combination Bluetooth stereo MP3 playback phone would imply A2DP (stereo) Bluetooth profile supported

phone:  Admittedly, I probably assumed specific mention A2DP implied phone support it, doesn't help searching internet yields mixed results issue, even Nokia tech support still can't tell one way other

phone: The phone apparently tested "large" music libraries

phone:  The phone organize tracks subfolders; tracks within main music folder subfolders loaded one huge playlist

phone:  And gets worse: filling 2GB card manually creating playlist every album, 77 total, attempting change playlists completely crashes phone

phone:  It's almost humorous happens track 999: phone increments first 9 10, see track 10 000 (except last digit partially cut off)

phone:  Frankly, don't seem interested working kinks mid-market phone outdated software components

phone: I'd still recommend phone don't large music collection want use music player occasionally

phone:  If won't use music player all, please buy cheaper phone doesn't it

phone: EXCELLENT phone

phone: i love everything phone

phone:  ease use, extensive cusomizations, high quality sound quality reception (which obviously two important things phone all

screen: ) bright, stunning screen

phone:  sleek, stylish, highly functional phone

battery: the caveats phone, numerous severe enough drop review 4 stars, decent battery life, 24 mb memory

battery: When I bought phone, I read battery wasn't greatest

phone: )It's sad would good phone otherwise

phone:  The style cute little push button opens phone up, I really liked

battery:  And format customizable (like Nokias) battery didn't drain like leaky faucet

phone: I can't recommend phone unfortunately I'm going return mine

battery:  And since I read 6555 bad far battery life goes, I guess year first time 10 years I've use another brand Nokia

phone: A words wise, Don't buy phone

phone:  I got phone upgrade w/ contract renewal, mistake

phone:  This phone straight crap

phone:  Let's say, don't EVER, EVER EVER EVER DROP THIS PHONE

phone: I dropped phone One time straight stopped working

phone:  phone would take lickin' keep tickin

phone: I lot research purchased phone

battery:  Upon customers' review, I knew battery life would short purchasing

phone:  However, I didn't expect charge phone everyday

phone:  The battery bar went 1/4th I made hour phone call (the battery full made call)

battery:  The battery bar went 1/4th I made hour phone call (the battery full made call)

battery:  It's ridiculous short battery life is

screen:  However, date/year displayed internal screen external screen

phone:  So need open phone check date every time, convenient all

phone:  Besides two cons, Nokia 6126 excellent phone use

phone:  Overall, Nokia 6126 good phone use

phone:  Since got phone free ATT 2yr agreement, I'm gonna return even i'm dissatisfied battery life

battery:  Since got phone free ATT 2yr agreement, I'm gonna return even i'm dissatisfied battery life

screen:  If I activate external screen I open phone, open close phone couple times, issues

phone: but fear losing internal screen permanently, I phone replaced

screen: but fear losing internal screen permanently, I phone replaced

phone: AT&T; sent remanufactured replacement brand new phone

phone: For Mac users, phone compatible iSync, however plugin found websites

phone: Call quality good, antenna placement (it bottom) basically gives one position hold phone without disrupting reception

phone:  I tried removing replacing card phone off, phone recognized card card inserted

screen: Now, may seem like nit picking, internal screen flush top piece, maybe better discription it's considerably inset, protective covering

screen:  Dirt, dust oils collects around edges screen quite quickly nearly impossible clean

screen:  Resist urge wipe clean - anything wipe screen ends crack

phone: I've used past phones average two years more, somehow I don't see happening phone

phone: This phone deserves zero rating

battery:  Battery half full, decided take break guess

camera: - Camera like trip back earliest digital cameras early 90s

phone: - I never even use phone anything else phone calls

battery:  I don't really care camera, mp3 on, I dissapointed even simple things like staying battery full, challenge

phone: The Nokia Suite Phone cannot dedect contents Sim Card, Sim itself

phone: (Only Phone memory add Miro-chip memory available

phone:  The Contact List core phone

camera: If want camera - get digital camera clarity world difference

phone: )There plenty sites discuss good points, I agree it's nice phone core reason phone, contacts appointment calendar editing & printing wouldn't cumbersome simply unavailable

battery: My last beef battery life

phone:  For purposes, standby gives relative sufficient time, use phone PC sync, one better hurry

phone: I recently bought phone 20$ GoPhone losing Samsung Sync :( I fully prepared phone way Sync phone par better areas

screen: The screen vibrant big screen Sync many newer phones

screen:  You even change main screen shortcuts calender like smartphone

battery: The sd card behind battery cover

battery: Battery life extremely short charge every night good

phone: When I wear waist, antenna pokes side frequency, eventually antenna broke off, although phone seemed work fine without it

phone:  Also I lean over, ribcage presses release button, causing phone drop I stand again

phone:  However, I wouldn't use leather case since would interfere car holster phone locks via indentations side body phone

phone: The Nokia belt clip works like this: there's round button 1/4&quot; deep snaps onto back phone behind earpiece end

phone:  Because it's round, button-like clasp mechanism allows phone swivel, doesn't dig side leg sit down

phone: )There's little spring loaded button top clip (the photo Amazon really upside-down) disengages round clasp lets pop phone

phone: These best way carry phone I've found

battery:  Digital standby OK, talking roaming suck battery fast

battery:  That's probably phone's problem, battery though

battery: It's good battery

battery: u cannot talk much using battery 8860's battery

phone: if u phone little expensive good enough 

phone:  Finally - I've market headsets problems maintaining good contact phone

phone:  Only locked onto phone maintained contact 100% time

phone:  The round ear bud might fit everyone, I haven't tried long phone calls (yet), initially comfortable (more Jabra gel's I've used past)

phone:  Cord phone adequate length - haven't disconnections

phone:  I drive, shop, anything that's non-strenuous keep phone conversation going indefinitely

phone:  The phone setting allows phone/earpiece ring connected

phone:  No reaching phone even connect button earpiece wire

phone:  The caution careful snag wire sure main phone unit securely attached belt clothing

phone: This great thing always phone

phone:  The little prongs headset insert phone keep breaking

phone: talking actually phone used

phone: This handsfree set compatible NOkia 6100 phone

phone:  The jack small phone

phone: Does cut ambient noise, makes voice smaller phone

phone:  The design connection phone isn't durable

phone:  It looks like I'm stuck I buy different kind phone

phone:  An in-the-ear phone mike dangling far away mouth? Bu AT&amp;T phone center salesman wearing one, seemed like it

phone:  I've used driving, sitting front computer paddling kayak, phone safely tucked waterproof bag- I never complaint audio quality caller end

phone:  I Nokia phone headset

phone:  Convenient button wire connects earpiece phone allows answer calls without fumbeling find button keypad driving

phone: While I really appreciate accessory freedom movement allows (no crick neck trying precariously clench phone ear shoulder), ear bud uncomfortable

phone:  Not I hear person end phone great clarity, hear me

phone:  Every time would sit phone belt clip, point contact always base phone right headset attached, thus causing fine wires coming attachment break

phone:  Also, two plastic tabs attach headset cell phone always breaking ruining use headset

phone:  The attachment needs either ninety degree angle (so wires come side bottom) built mount side cell phone

phone: The way headset connects nokia phone poorly designed

phone:  If phone clipped belt noisy environment hockey game, I cannot hear ring

phone: I time getting used earpiece help use phone safely car

phone:  But jack used connect phone flimsy

phone:  Now I can't plug phone

phone: I ordered two headsets one I got phone stopped working

phone:  This mitigated twisting plug around (go figure) moving phone around -- kind like trying pick radio station

phone: I would agree reviewers saying probably best hands-free set phone market

phone: The microphone sensitive wind mid- high-pitched noises, cell phone without attachment

phone:  Reception ear bud equally clear (you'll probably want turn volume phone using it)

phone:  I use cell phone primary phone, long conversations either walking sitting it's great relief

phone: Headset adapter doesn't fit phone connection

phone: Bought two still don't headset cell phone

phone: I finally found ear piece 2 year old Nokia phone

phone:  It's truly hands free answer calls hang without find cell phone it's attached to

phone: It must saved couple times driving trying talk phone answer call

phone: Also, law it's illegal drive talking phone saves dumb tickets

phone:  For me, I talking cell phone without headset

phone:  The price great I got one husband's phone too

price:  The price great I got one husband's phone too

price: 99(US$) so, I'm sure price marked high here

phone:  It's matter phone fitting another phone's case, 8260's charging port lines exactly hole case

phone:  Retreival phone easy (you take phone case use, unless using headset)

phone: This phone case great protecting phone 

phone:  Personally I found leather flap covers face phone annoyance

phone: It makes difficult to:1) Answer ringing phone - open properly locate call answer button2) Talk phone - You open dial either hold flap open talk (it rubs face) close open ensure properly hung up

phone: Unlike brands face flap opens horizontally, either rub neck trying talk phone open block peripheral vision slightly

phone: For reasons I prefer either cell phone case clear front front cover opens vertically removed entirely

phone: Lastly, I found make case I received hole bottom allows access charging jack headphone socket obstructed, requiring insert either angle, possibly damaging phone

camera:  I've even clipped camera case belt &amp; never lost despite roller coasters turn upside down

phone:  I personally use phone &quot;emergency situations&quot; I don't get many phone calls

phone:  Also, I phone case slip car also

phone: We extreme difficuty trying place case phone

phone: Of course made bulky cell phone even bulkier; hey, least gave chance wear belt

phone: I bought case expectation clipping belt bag, making phone accessable

phone: I ordered case fit 6160 Nokia phone

phone:  As matter fact, case actually snug (probably allow leather stretch [over time] still properly fit phone), I found bit struggle unzip zip phone

phone:  It's leather-covered, doesn't protrude much beyond case, securely fastens phone belt

phone:  If don't need wrist strap, good case protect cell phone investment

phone: A carrying case serve two functions: making phone easier carry (via clip whatever attaching device may have), &amp; protecting phone dirt &amp; damage

phone:  This carrying case make phone easier carry via belt clip, protect phone way

screen:  The face open, dirt dust reach screen &amp; keypad

phone:  I use Microsoft Voice Command XV6700 PocketPC phone

phone:  I A900 phone Sprint headsets I frequently lost paring headset

phone: looks greatpairs quickly Motorola Qlove neckstrapsupports audio streaming phone does

phone:  But it's extremeif it's paired, phone rings takes seconds pair back up, isn't headset issue, BlueTooth like headsets

phone: The reception good, I get little bit static phone 10 feet away

phone:  I able answer quickly walked back phone get rid static

phone: Occasionally I turn blue tooth phone (XV6700), turn power Nokia headset get sync

phone:  This first Bluetooth, maybe expectations unrealistic, I can't hear without static thing unless I hold phone (Samsung A920) near ear within foot - defeats entire purpose

price: Again, first Bluetooth, I disappointed major inconveniences given price

price:  I don;t even mind price high quality function

phone: Worked fine co-workers phone (Samsung i730) I hear connect/disconnect "bleeps" successfully force phone redial

phone: So far I able get headset work Nokia 6133 phone

phone:  They pair & connect phone seem recognize headset

phone:  The headset symbol come display audio routed to/from headset, stays phone

phone:  The headset work properly Nokia 8801 Motorola RAZR headsets work properly phone

phone:  The ringtones setup Nokia phone (even distinctive ringtones) clearly heard headset

battery:  battery time reasonable

battery:  Battery life great; I usually get 2 days I talk several hours per day

phone:  On top that, I put phone pocket (same side headset) I start hear static headset

price:  I read ton reviews finally settled one it's size price

battery:  Great sound quality, battery life size

phone:  Unfortunately, I seem received broken one, can't even get far away phone putting pants pocket without losing signal disconnecting

phone:  Pairing headset nokia phone cake

phone:  I able get Nokia BH-800 pair phone headset icon would display audio connection phone

phone:  I tried BH-800 headset T-Mobile MDA worked fine-- seems problem either headset phone

battery:  Battery life robust -- advertised

phone:  If don't like looking like cyborg phone good compromise

phone:  It took 3 phone calls I received response option replacement option available refund

phone: cheap phone skin

phone: The HS26w 3rd BT headset, phone i'm using Sony-Ericsson w600i

phone: 0, sooner later i'll end phone does, get headset that's already using new standard? Paid 49 USD this, I've headset week now, i'm entirely pleased

phone:  So, guess pretty much phone dependent thing, mileage may vary

phone: on upside, pairing headset phones PCs pretty easy, headset doesn't seem pairing mode - need search phone pc, enter passcode thats it

battery:  After this, started beeping low battery needed recharged

phone: 4) Sometimes device disconnects phone I dialing number I pair device again

phone:  It's big deal it's simply annoying re trying connect number won't realize already disconnected unless watch phone

phone: 1) Works nicely within range Nokia Phone pairing breeze

battery: I using battery

phone:  This dependant data plan, phone simply ability

phone: The phone also trouble downloading games

phone:  "File large save" appears, even though phone shows enough available memory

phone: Multi-Media Messaging (picture messages):The phone folder "clip arts" phones would variety small pictures put messages

phone:  For phone camera, ought include SOMETHING send MMS

phone:  Of course can't send copy-protected ringers buy T-Mobile, standard, Nokia copy-protected ringers included phone

phone:  The phone NO included sounds sent MMS, available data cable, transfer method, options making working MMS messages kind limited

phone: Web Browser:This may disappointing part phone me, Nokia phones used always pretty good web browsers, certainly better Samsung

phone: Unlike browser older models like 3100 8390, one works slowly, probably due slow processor phone

phone:  Even going simple text-based T-zones pages would pop instantly older models, phone least briefly shows "Processing data" waiting message showing page

phone:  The phone trying figure display page already loaded

screen:  One time browser even crashed dumped back standby screen

phone:  So phone hardly included ringers, data cable available Nokia, crummy web browser trying download ringers web

phone: But included web browser stinks, download Opera Mini like Java phones, use view websites? Because, recall, phone won't allow Java applications access web

phone: Overall Construction:It's Nokia's best-made phone ever

phone:  Some parts fit together larger gaps would expect, even cheap phone

battery: The battery cover doesn't fit perfectly

phone:  When new, feels like used phone

phone:  It doesn't snap firmly, doesn't fit tightly back phone

phone:  You look like idiot doesn't know use phone

phone:  You unselect think gone, next time turn phone comes back

phone:  Not incompetent programming, it's dumb voicemail option shortcut list all, like every phone planet already voicemail speed dial printed 1 key

phone: I chose phone simply cheapest, made Nokia whose phones I've always great experience with---solid, reliable, intuitive great reception

phone: I disappointed, phone delivers counts

phone: ---but COME ON folks, much REALLY need useless crap? Cell phone manufacturers cram fluff phones order reel suckers gadget geeks there

camera:  Sheesh, I wanted listen music go I'd buy MP3 player I wanted take pics I'd buy cheap digital camera actually real lens usual lousy 

phone:  There doesn't seem way turn chime phone makes turning off, pain want turn cinema right movie starts, unfortunately

battery:  This means switch "silent" fine unless you're already low battery

phone:  Luckily battery life phone quite good shouldn't much issue

battery:  Luckily battery life phone quite good shouldn't much issue

phone:  There way assigning different ringtones different people phone book (Ringer ID) tell who's calling w/o look screen, even though phone offer Caller ID maybe 2 dozen different ringtones choose from

phone: All 3 completely unnecessary inconveniences technological economic cost standpoint, I suspect Nokia saddled phone 3 disadvantages purpose, deliberate sales/marketing reasons

price:  Either that, bunch flaming idiots honestly expect get high-end bells whistles bargain basement price

phone:  I use cell phone calls text messages alarm clock

battery: I seen people compare motorola razr, I can't see grounds comparison, except possibly battery life weak

phone:  But, come extra battery, desk charger makes possible charge phone extra batter time, Nokia really think hard fixing flaws

phone:  Not 'matrix-looking' phone, everything phone does, style

phone: ordered phone last night

phone:  version - NOKIA 8801 (8800 version Africa, Asia & Europe) mixed reviews "metal" phone

phone: as mentioned beginning, i'm still waiting phone

phone:  Keep mind phone voice dial one touch dialing feature

battery:  I guess besides not-so-strong power battery (talk time stand time), it's nice get two batteries cost around $50 dollars

battery:  Nokia should've used battery size 6620 model

battery:  But looking size phone, it's understandable it's small battery size

battery:  In time I'm sure come powerful battery I'm sure sites sell batteries less, Nokia recommends purchase accessories reputable authorized dealer

phone:  In terms functionality, phone doesn't seem much phones there, cares? It's gorgeous

phone:  Also, unlocked phone I kinda worried process getting work Cingular I popped SIM card I able dial everything immediately

phone:  Overall, great phone buy (oh I got mine CompUSA cheaper here, shhh, don't tell anybody :o)

phone: All I look phone looks, small is, fast (browsing address book, deleting messages, going menues)

phone:  The 8801 perfectly considering Color phone

phone:  That phone lag erase messages browse menues

camera:  Not that, soon followed camera phones

camera: With color camera phone combination, cells started increase size functions

phone: With color camera phone combination, cells started increase size functions

phone:  All wanted print spec sheets showing many actions particular cell phone perform

phone:  It cammera, takes horrible pictures I dont care (I actually rather phone one)

phone:  This phone exactly I looking for

phone: If want FAST, BEAUTIFUL, HEAD TURNING phone it

phone: Nokia warrants phone two years find special number warranty manual phone

phone:  Explain problem get phone shipped overnight

phone: The ONLY drawback far I've everyone wanting take look phone I take puch talk someone

camera: When people see bulky phones, ask many MP camera go online things downloaded

phone:  I guarantee phone (except VERTU phones) catch type attension

phone:  Materials used design think far beyond phone

phone: When I first saw phone I truly love, phone someone clue money, conception value obviously common sense

phone:  All I say I love phone I love children

phone:  From sleek look luxurious feel, I knew I made first phone call phone me

phone: The stainless steel body comes handy especially drop phone often I do

phone:  After dropping phone numerous occasions Nokia walked away scratch

phone: I like heaviness size phone, short battery life could annoying, I usually get full day full charge, hence phone comes spare battery

battery: I like heaviness size phone, short battery life could annoying, I usually get full day full charge, hence phone comes spare battery

phone:  One things I dislike phone difficult adjust listening volume, must done phone

phone:  The battery time ridiculosly short infuriate anyone uses phone business calls road

battery:  The battery time ridiculosly short infuriate anyone uses phone business calls road

battery:  Sure, there's spare battery carry even personal time

phone:  Although I never dropped phone spilt water it, gradual deterioation key pad response within 3 months

phone:  I sent phone back Nokia fully expecting refund replacement informed water damage

phone:  The phone hyper sensitive used people keep little leather pouch provide 99% time

phone:  Anyone needs real phone rather pure fashion statement look elsewhere

price:  Besides outrageously expensive price tag compared competitors, Nokia 8801 doesn't many areas brag about

phone:  However, extremely gorgeous phone

phone:  Every angle phone exudes quality luxury

phone:  The sliding phone upwards reveal keypad addicting

phone: As fashion accessory second "weekend/party" phone, I would given solid 5 stars since beautiful physically stunning phone market right now

phone:  However, rest us day job earn living, price-to-performance ratio key deciding premium prmary phone buy

phone:  Meaning countries, phone rendered useless poor signal

phone:  This maybe unacceptable us pay $600+ dosmetic-only phone

phone:  If happen travel China, could use phone tell time prehaps much else since China use GSM 900 Mhz

screen:  The LCD screen beautiful tad small

phone: Features-wise comparison becomes ordinary, "not-worth-the-money" phone

phone:  You could get tons phone free, like Nokia 6682 basically set features

phone: Just reiterate looking premium primary phone best price-to-performance ratio, I suggest look elsewhere

phone: But owned solid reliable sedan, looking fancy convertible summer weather, phone much worth consideration

battery: First, obvious, battery issue

battery:  I knew going battery life sub-par

screen:  OK, I live given screen

phone:  However, 10 months, batt won't keep phone alive 12 hours

phone:  And phone doesn't reliably seat properly charging station

price: Overall, I'd probably buy price I paid came initially

phone: I've phone week chance try features except Bluetooth headset feature (since I don't Bluetooth headset)

camera: Look Feel:The look feel camera absolutely top-notch

phone:  The phone isn't heavy, it's definitely feels substantive

phone:  A couple wipes included pouch takes care fingerprints (the pouch made synthetic suede-like material drags across phone bit resistance wipes away fingerprints easily)

phone: Techy stuff:Voice quality phone good

phone: The phone comes suite software enables synchronize contacts (only using phone's memory, SIM card memory), upload music wallpapers, make backups content phone

phone:  This first phone I could update via PC, I say, I never go back updating things within phone again

phone: I data plan phone (that's Blackberry for) I didn't check web browser all

phone: Cons:The minor negative I phone keypad

phone: All all, nice phone across board

price: It looks good, many issues worth price point

phone:  If phone goes $100 I might buy pretty paper weight

camera:  And camera junk, question (0

camera: 2 MP camera

battery:  battery life joke, last half day normal usage

price: funtionality justify price

phone: First all, I see lot hate reviews people doesn't even phone

phone:  Some negative points made phone true;-we get 'top-notch' phone-the phone replaces (8890i, 8890) brought new features, phone simply not-might little bit lighter (138gr

phone: )-attracts finger prints huge problem made reviews, pouch provided takes care perfectlyBut big catch point I say phone replaces; DO NOT expect see proce cuts phone RAZR, phone always exclusive

phone:  As time goes on, phone bought 9 months ago gets old, DESIGN gets old, start see everywhere

phone:  Before phone I owned S700, I paing 649$ (same prove I paid 8801 now), 8 months later price 379$ lost exclusivity SonyEricsson started use design phones

price:  Before phone I owned S700, I paing 649$ (same prove I paid 8801 now), 8 months later price 379$ lost exclusivity SonyEricsson started use design phones

phone: Most thew reviews high phone 

phone: 1-A cell phone make CALLS , words , quality reception mic/speaker important , 6600 relatively low volume speaker , you'd press hard ear hear anything person saying , unless surroundings completely quiet 

phone: 4- My idea all-in-one , theory -once again- proves wrong , phone excells nothing , less average everything , seriously need "other phone" functionalities , you'll disappointed 

phone: Basically 6600 bundle over-hyped features don't won't need (if get PDA pocket PC) , none work , basic phone functions ergonomics less average

phone:  charging port top phone makes awkward use charging

camera:  descent camera video2

phone:  music player phone good (although MP3 ringtones)In summary, don't care MP3 Ringtones using headphones without pay extra adapter, IS good phone stand everyday wear tear 

camera: Pros: Flip button, memory slot, separate holes charger headset, EXCELLENT MP3 player clear loud sound (good enough boombox), alarm goes even phone silent, camera (though clear, least it's there), video record long memory lets (most phones record 15 secs, one record 40 minutes depending much space have), radio, though can't set MP3's ringtones, convert WMA still set them; camera flash [night vision], use headphones listen music, drains virtually NO battery life (I listened 8 hours straight phone still full bars),Cons: Can't fast forward rewind videos, radio one station (??

phone:  Strangely enough, phone initial charge fine, would never charge again

phone:  But coming Palm PDA experience, I somewhat disappointed PDA capabilities phone

phone:  For example, I sync'ed Palm Outlook, many entries use "Main" phone number

phone:  Outlook got fine, Nokia PC Suite couldn't sync phone

wifi:  The Treos might make good choice, don't WiFi (yet), phone, can't touch Nokia

wifi:  Motorola Q? Nice, also WiFi

phone:  The perfect phone still doesn't exist, E61 sure raised bar

phone:  It good performance, I used I cannot live without (but I would switch phone would solve "bugs")

phone: It excellent sound quality I'm listening music phone

price: Works like supposed price reasonable

price: This wonderful product especially price

phone:  The second prong broke rendering product somewhat useful severely compromised point I didn't want use anymore b/c would unattach calls listing music There interference phone call, infrequent could concern

phone: This produce works great Nokia 6085 Cell phone easy setup use

phone: I'm previous owner Body Glove Cel Phone cases (a Moto V810)

phone: My next phone body glove case too

phone:  It sturdy holds cell phone tight

screen:  I like keeps screen inside keep getting scratched

phone:  It holds phone well swivels pretty nicely

phone:  The inside clip layer micro fiber protect screen phone

screen:  The inside clip layer micro fiber protect screen phone

screen:  This clip cloth type insert inside keeps screen safe without scratching

phone:  The unit sturdy holds phone place indication would fall out

phone:  The release lever works well easy pop phone one hand

phone: Fits phone well

phone:  Detach mechanism phone seems secure, workable one hand

phone: Two minor complaints order annoyance:1) outward-facing part clip holds phone place somewhat sharp, I frequently catch arm sleeve it

phone: 2) case enough flex, little pressure easily flexes, buttons get pressed, phone beeps

phone: Product describe, lasted quite good even thought phone outlived clip, I still phone clip got broken, cannot really complain cannot expect last forever right

phone:  Which world's best smart phone

phone:  It hold phone though made durable plastic

phone: This far best phone holster ever used phone, PERIOD

phone:  The fit phone perfect release lever worries phone ever falling case

phone:  There things think ordering case, it's hard put case down, need consider like phone screen facing in

screen:  There things think ordering case, it's hard put case down, need consider like phone screen facing in

phone:  This case phone sits facing case

phone:  If use phone alot, remove case every time need see screen

screen:  If use phone alot, remove case every time need see screen

phone:  I also find little hard work release clip remove phone 1 hand

phone:  I found working clip trying "pry" phone another annoying issue

screen:  And bought case knowing screen faces in

phone:  If made case phone facing out, I would buy it

phone:  caveat remove phone access charger usb slot

phone:  However, March 26, 2004, even though product claims work Nokia 3200, actually NOT compatible cell phone

phone:  It fit bottom phone

phone: This cable great transferring data phone computer

phone:  The drivers make phone appear serial device (com5 example)

phone: You still need additional software manage phone content itself--on 6030 manage audio video content--no contacts, phone numbers, etc

phone: I purchased cable nokia 6060 phone works perfect

phone: I AT&amp;T 8260, fits fine holster (the Voicestream phone actually smaller slimmer, may fit well, I'm sure)

phone: The holster leaves phone face-out, chance scratching face you're careful, I'm worried that

phone:  If extra careful standing sitting phone belt, might break holster

phone:  If like me, however, idea belt clip I don't think carrying phone around time

phone:  Anyway, I end getting something durable future I suggest consider problem light personal phone carrying habits

phone: After using holster less week, product already scratched phone

phone:  I frequently phone knocked holster insecure fit, thus adding scratches, yes

phone:  Even slightest activity beyond walking phone liable fall out

phone:  I get phone replaced (thank God Warranties

phone:  I since bought one Body Glove holsters protect phone well get secure method clip phone onto belt fear continued scratching losing phone

phone: &quot;Final Thought&quot; - spend extra 2 3 dollars get something protect phone

phone:  It makes good-looking phone appear cheap

phone:  It really protects little phone scratches dings I use everyday life

phone: The cell phone plate perfect gift sister college

phone:  My sister uses cell phone several times day, it's useful AND trendy

phone:  This really perfect gift anyone college owns cell phone

phone:  It also easy take phone

price:  The price faceplate anywhere else double price

screen: For 7160 case necessity want protect expensive screen delicate slide

phone:  Bought case becase I've ruined phones hanging belt clip point rear case cracked someone clipped phone

phone:  First leather hard glove soft making removal phone difficult

phone:  Second get grip phone remove case slider automatically pulled open good thing slider relatively delicate

phone: I disappointed buying Nokia Compact Desktop Charging Stand Nokia 8260 Phones include adapter charge phone

price:  And price way high stand 

phone: you use one came phone purchase additional power cord charger

phone: I recently bought Nokia 8260 stand store phone use

phone:  It makes easy charge phone: easier drop phone stand I get home pick I leave

phone:  I use Rapid Charger came phone

battery: Other comments charger included space charge second battery

phone: I must agree charger stand useful accessory phone

phone:  Save money buy buy case phone instead - scratches easily

phone: I purchased 8260 phone Amazon bought accessory

phone:  The power cord came phone plugs right charger

phone:  It looks great desk I would recommend nice base park phone using it

price:  Only reason I'm giving 5 stars price bit high get

phone:  I like able stand phone desk see face pick see calling

phone:  It EASILY fits adapter came pre-packaged phone takes little space desk

phone:  All drop phone cradle let charge

phone:  Once got passed part, charger wonderful easy plop phone in

price:  They better price doe

phone:  Problem is, rapid charger comes packaged phone purchase DOES NOT fit charger

phone:  It fits phone perfectly, velcro quite tight, belt hook swivels easily, quite simple unhook phone talking

phone:  I worn phone belt daily months

phone:  I suspect fit phone case tightly

phone:  As instructions state, must push phone hard first stretch leather case bottom corners phone stretch strap completely get total contact velcro pads

phone:  After put phone case times, fits like glove, holds securely, works conveniently, looks stylish

phone: I day boyfriend looking plastic carrying case phone

phone:  He one pager doesn't like leather one phone in

phone:  He plastic one phone broken it

phone:  We mall phone places didn't carry them

phone: Ok, I'm glad I'm one who's phone fallen case

phone:  My phone fell case today lunch I leaving LCD broken display ANYTHING

phone:  The phone come unclipped, weak velcro holds case closed around phone comes undone, phone slides right out

phone:  (but also inherent design flaw phone itself) So I going replace phone case/clip provide protection actually prone holding phone

phone: I love look case, fact made leather, enables phone attach belt

phone:  However, aspects disappoint far numerous:* case makes previously small sleek phone quite bulky cumbersome,* screen phone could easily protected clear plastic cover left exposed easier scratch,* phone cannot placed desktop charger without removing case,* case constantly readjusted velcro closure hold tight case eventually moves front holes made earpiece making harder hear, and* placement swivel mechanism velcro case make difficult phone actually swivel

screen:  However, aspects disappoint far numerous:* case makes previously small sleek phone quite bulky cumbersome,* screen phone could easily protected clear plastic cover left exposed easier scratch,* phone cannot placed desktop charger without removing case,* case constantly readjusted velcro closure hold tight case eventually moves front holes made earpiece making harder hear, and* placement swivel mechanism velcro case make difficult phone actually swivel

phone:  The width velcro closure actually closely matches width grooves belt holder, often times pull phone straight remove belt holder

phone:  Otherwise pull velcro remove phone case fit properly again

phone:  The phone also prone falling case easily

phone:  The case even claims do, &quot;enhance beauty phone

phone:  Do buy case unless want destroy beauty phone, I think looks quite attractive without case, potentially destroy phone itself

phone: As reported people, carrying case really looks nice, *but* lose phone

phone:  I got carrying case Xmas, lost phone January 10

phone: As reported people, I also lost phone due ill-designed, defective belt clip

phone:  I got clip Xmas, lost phone January 10th

phone: The release velcro swiveled past belt clip cost new phone

battery: The tape removed replace battery becomes necessary

phone:  It rather defeat use desktop charger, accesory connects &quot;standing&quot; phone

phone:  Velco closure needs work; actually catches belt clip come undone leaving phone flapping breeze

phone:  The first day phone fell twice

phone:  This case clearly designed offer portability phone allowing user clip belt -- protective cover

phone:  Second, phone doesn't fall case

phone:  If use phone environment necessitates protection puts abnormal stresses velcro strap, perhaps look elswhere case

phone:  In fact, I'd look different model phone -- one rugged tiny 8260

phone: After reading posted reviews, I found I must attach holder belt, attach phone case holder

phone:  I case clip, closes protect front phone

phone:  It's still easy remove phone case use

phone: The swivel case nice idea, happen sit phone doesn't swivel anticipated direction, plastic belt clip break disconnect connector back leather case

phone:  This allow phone fall, worse, land quietly someone else find it

phone:  If shop around find aftermarket leather case fit phone like glove, stiched clip back, like better eyeglass case

phone: This case attaches well belt clip problem first weeks use (and sometimes beyond) phone fall case

phone:  The phone held velcro peice near top phone catch stuff (like coat) come undone

phone:  Then phone falls (but case stays firmly attached belt

phone:  Also since case cover front phone nothing protect display phone tends scratch easily

phone: Though clip phone nicely designed sturdy, actual leather case leaves much desired

phone:  The case barely large enough strap top phone

phone:  Furthermore, phone attaches clip rotational pivot, allowing case turn upside belt spilling phone

phone:  I lost phone 2

phone: Picked I got Nokia 8260 - couldn't find leather case anywhere Amazon built tiny phone

price:  Please post accurate picture substantiate price

phone:  I think everyone looking plastic cover front phone protect finish, I buy product I know truly looks like

phone:  The case also carry clip fixed case (eg; 5160 model) instead hooked belt clip (the phone easily slides case stooping)

phone: Nice fit phone convenient belt clip swivels move around

phone: I cracked LCD phone I standing near door somebody opened suddenly

phone: This opens case enough merely kneeling phone falls out

phone:  Also, phone unlike previous Nokias NOT made using quality plastics - makes clear lens far susceptible scratching

phone: I bought case one purpose mind, carry phone belt clip (versus pocket)

phone:  After this, top fastener case loosened phone tended slip out

phone: A worthless waste money, case drops phone regularly

phone:  Finally, I decided using rubber band leather case would make phone secure

phone: While leaving Ft Meyers Airport Florida yesterday Security Guard asked rubber band holding phone together

phone:  The phone week old looks like war

phone:  The velcro drops quarter inch short prevent phone dropping out

phone:  Had phone broken one drops I never would consider Nokia again, lack attention detail would persuade think craftsmanship may extend phone itself

battery: This battery Nokia, honestly works pretty well

phone:  It battery comes phone Nokia 8260

battery:  It battery comes phone Nokia 8260

battery:  I found battery life lasted maybe even little longer Nokia rated it

battery:  I would definately reccomend stick OEM battery - aftermarket battery I bought weeks one, didn't really last long died me

price:  As far price concerned,well

phone:  This battery alone cost half cost I paid phone itself

battery:  This battery alone cost half cost I paid phone itself

phone:  However, consideration spend enough time phone warrant need another battery

battery:  However, consideration spend enough time phone warrant need another battery

phone:  The phone automatically switches &quot;Car&quot; normal modes, happily insert remove holder middle conversation

phone: Although seems much safer using phone car &quot;hand held&quot; mode, much less fiddly distracting earpiece/microphone plug &quot;hands free&quot; devices, important remember even full car kit research shows accidents increase compared &quot;no phone&quot;

phone: Overall, excellent, well made , product significantly increases utility phone , compared going &quot;hand held&quot;, adds safety 

phone: THIS CAR KIT IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO USES THE CELL PHONE WHILE DRIVING

phone:  This means phone rings, radio goes off

phone:  2) If leave phone cradle ignition off, automatically turn phone off, don't waste car battery (or 'auto-answer' calls, you're there)

battery:  2) If leave phone cradle ignition off, automatically turn phone off, don't waste car battery (or 'auto-answer' calls, you're there)

phone:  My wife also one, car, phone uses car radio speaker phone speaker

phone: Great system, except I would like see adjustment phone mount unit

phone: I kept old analog Motorola car phone years I didn't want trade something stuck cigar lighter whistled speaker on

phone:  Just buy beleive me, happy safe using cell phone car

battery: I ordered Amazon - I got battery marked &quot;Nokia&quot;, packaging someone called Cellstar, said responsible warranty coverage, etc

battery: I almost didn't order product Amazon, earlier review said battery repackaged warranty covered Cellstar

battery:  In case misgivings based upon review, battery arrived original Nokia bubble pack, 1-year warranty covered Nokia

battery: The 8260 uses BLB-3 (920 mAh) battery 8290 uses BLB-2 (650 mAh) battery

battery:  So good battery models since doesn't fit 8260

phone: The belt clip made Nokia 8260 practical comes keeping phone vs

phone:  floor, however, clip short cannot even make around average belt like phone clips (aftermarket otherwise) do

phone:  Therefore, cannot place belt without worrying may still drop phone

phone:  The clip looks pretty neat phone

phone:  So basically - doesn't expand enough fit around belt clip short phone falls off

phone:  I found stays belt carefull let phone drop

battery:  You replace battery cover came phone, belt clip illustrated above

phone:  When you're car, take phone belt slide clip slot base

phone: The clip holds phone quite well base

phone: This holder inexpensviely gives secure, unintrusive place put phone car, also providing belt clip

phone: The &quot;hinge&quot; clip low phone allow one clip pocket, purse, etc

phone: , top phone becomes exposed)

phone:  I Ericsson phone hinge closer top phone worked perfectly

phone:  That leaves practical use hook onto stationary object - mobile phone holder car

phone:  I use holder I used Ericsson phone works well

phone:  THE CLIP IS SO SLIM LINE THAT THE PHONE CAN STILL FIT IN MY POCKET

phone: Before attaching clip, phone forever drifting bottom bag

phone:  The clip seems sturdy; unfortunately, scratch score surface belt phone pulled wrong angle (perhaps seatbelt, brushing something)

phone:  The case cover earphone charging jacks bottom phone, completely obscure IR windown side 8290, phone must removed case use IR features

phone:  It may apparent photo, case cover/protect surface LCD display keypad, may scratched splashed; I haven't trouble that, would preferred crucial areas phone better protected exposure

phone: I purchased phone "back up" event main phone became inoperable (which did) I digress

phone:  This phone great basics only

phone:  Third, phone doesn't click like normal hands-free kit does, stick two cables little holes time place cradle

battery:  And fourth, need replace battery cover one clip attached order attach cradle

phone:  This adds little bulkiness phone people carry pocket like I do

phone:  However, getting around plugging cables phone

phone:  I thought plugging unplugging worn speaker/mic plug phone people I called would complain static would go away I moved speaker plug slightly

phone: Now I new phone still probs

phone:  You still take hands steering wheel answer phone make call

battery:  There little drain enough ever discharge car battery

battery:  Extended use drains battery (used pwer speaker recharging net zero loss)

phone:  With Nokia 3285 even picks phone automatically I never touch phone I'm driving

phone:  The piece clips phone longer clicks properly, slightest jar comes out

phone:  Also, ability use phone headset product never seemed work quite well, I'd lose connection midst conversation

phone:  I think best deal get wireless phone built-in speaker phone

phone:  One little prongs cord broke off, remained bottom phone

phone:  Fortunately much effort I able remove prong phone

phone:  Also, fitting phone secure, move phone wrong way, cord comes out

phone: If purchase speaker, careful clip phone small plastic hooks

price:  The price makes great deal

phone:  It sounds good always charges phone

phone:  Have turned cell phone speaker phone

phone: I Nokie 5165 charging station doesn't hold well all--the slightest bump tap phone slides right out

phone:  Just 4 days 30-day return policy expired, small plastic piece covering half antenna top phone fell 2 4 phones -- even though weren't dropped

phone:  On phone, came I took phone back pocket

phone:  They wouldn't replace phone broken piece counts "physical damage," voids warrantee, unless Nokia issued advisory problems piece breaking (which Cingular salesman said gotten several complaints about)

phone:  Nokia said aren't authorized send replacement phone either, first I'd send two phones back assess whether problem created "physical liquid damage," even fault poor manufacturing, I may end pay repair phones

phone: )Right menu key => Phone settings (where I assign keys function)Left menu key => Call logsMenu center key => Gallery (See comment # 9 cons Menu center key)CUSTOMIZE keys
